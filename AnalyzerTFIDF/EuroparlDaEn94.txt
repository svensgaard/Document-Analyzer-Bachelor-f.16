Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 22 May 2008 .
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to remind you that Lithuania celebrated the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Lithuanian independence movement Sąjūdis yesterday .
Its foundation not only instigated the re-establishment of Lithuania 's independence but also heralded the collapse of the Soviet Union .
My warmest congratulations !
( Applause )
I would like to make you aware of the Green Weeks that are taking place in Brussels this week and in Luxembourg and Strasbourg in the next two weeks .
The central topics will be CO2 emissions and the associated climate change .
We have undertaken to reduce the European Parliament 's CO2 emissions by 30 % by the year 2020 .
In order to achieve this , a prestigious consulting firm is preparing a CO2 assessment for us , which will be ready in September and will be presented to the Bureau .
The project will flow into an action plan containing both short and long-term measures so that the European Parliament can reach the goal it has set itself .
I would be grateful for active interest on your part .
Welcome
I would like to extend a very warm welcome to His Eminence the Metropolitan Galaktion of Stara Zagora in Bulgaria , who is seated with a delegation of Orthodox clergy in the distinguished visitors ' gallery .
( Applause )
Your Eminence , it was a pleasure to be able to speak to you this morning .
It is also a great pleasure for me to welcome the winners of the first Charlemagne Youth Prize to the European Parliament today .
This prize is awarded jointly by the Foundation of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen and the European Parliament .
The award ceremony took place on 29 April in Aachen .
Our young friends have been visiting the European Parliament since yesterday and are in the distinguished visitors ' gallery right now .
( Applause )
I welcome the winner of the first prize , representing the project ' Students Without Boundaries ' , Emöke Korzenszky from Hungary , Ilona Mikoczy from Slovakia , Agota Demeter from Romania and Zoltan Csadi from Slovakia .
Lorenzo Marsili from the United Kingdom is representing the ' Festival of Europe ' project in London , which won second prize .
Last but not least , I welcome the winner of the third prize , which was awarded to the state grammar school in Vyronas , a suburb of Athens in Greece .
Paraskevi Christodoulopoulou , you are most welcome .
On behalf of the European Parliament , I would like to thank you for your contributions to promoting the idea of European integration amongst young people .

2006 Annual report on the CFSP - Annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP ( debate )

rapporteur . - Mr President , I should like to comment and express the views of Parliament on foreign policy during this debate , which is more than just a routine annual debate on foreign policy and the state of play of foreign policy in the Union : the participation of Mr Solana with us is a testimony that it is a special debate .
Thank you for coming , Mr Solana .
First , we are at a very important juncture , if not a turning point , in terms of foreign policy because of the Lisbon Treaty innovations .
We have to look back in order to evaluate as usual , but we also have to take a forward-looking approach .
We have high and growing citizen support for foreign policy , for one which is genuine and robust .
Member States ' perceptions increasingly change , seeing that speaking with one voice and acting in common is the only way to have an effective Union foreign policy .
Entering this new chapter of EU foreign policy , we are moving towards a qualitative change .
The new foreign policy should draw its legitimacy not only from its intergovernmental source , but also from European Parliament scrutiny , hence , as we will see , the growing importance and role of the European Parliament in shaping this policy , as we called for in our report .
We need an integrated and holistic approach to foreign policy , with cohesion , convergence and complementarity of all the institutions involved , including the Member States .
The European Union should continue its role as peace-maker and mediator , a soft power helping to stabilise , reconstruct and reform , a supplier of assistance and humanitarian aid , as a normative power , value-projecting and promoting democracy , freedom and human rights , but at the same time we should complement the soft dimension with a harder one by developing the ESDP dimension and our military capabilities to be prepared for power projection also .
We should complement our reactive policy to short- and medium-term challenges with a more long-term strategic approach and definition of European interests in the long term , by addressing the true causes and not only the effects of some changes around us like Darfur , which is both a climate and a conflict situation .
We should continue being active on various geographical priorities , but also face new challenges and horizontal issues like climate security , energy security , space security , cyber-security , migration flows and many others .
While aspiring to be a global power and a global actor , we should change the balance between being a payer , as we are and we want to be , and being a key player in the world arena .
The new Treaty offers a huge potential for a coherent and effective foreign policy , but we all know that implementation will be crucial .
We need collective will and cooperation , not only in the institutional triangle but also with Member States , and we have to avoid rivalries .
We tried to table a constructive approach in this report .
We are concerned by some failures of foreign policy , but we look more to the future .
We recognise positive evolution , progress and successes .
We recommend challenging the failures but building on achievements , and identifying room for further progress .
The European Parliament 's ambition is not only to scrutinise the foreign policy , to make recommendations on which to base solutions and choices for the executive branch , but also to invest in its own foreign policy-making , which I call ' parliamentary diplomacy ' , as it is run within our competence at parliamentary level .
On priorities , we believe that we need a focused approach and a limited number of priorities .
We underline the need for value-driven foreign policy , not because we are excessively idealistic or naive , but because a world around us which shares our own strong universal values will best serve our interests of security and prosperity .
Parliament considers the foreign policy of the Union as a contribution to strengthened European identity and also as value added for EU citizens and as part of the European Commission 's trajectory of a Europe of results .
We consider foreign policy as a key EU policy to be equipped with a proper institutional set-up , which the Lisbon Treaty brings about , proper instruments , and adequate financing out of the EU budget .
We need a set of instruments at our disposal , and that is something which lies ahead of us .
Mr President , in our report , we wished to avoid repeating statements from previous reports on the European Security Strategy .
Perhaps we have not entirely achieved this but I believe we can go further down this track in the future .
For example , one point that was decided on in earlier reports and that we did not address again for precisely that reason , but that should be mentioned here , is the European Parliament 's support for the European Security and Defence College .
We would like this to become a real institution , not just a virtual one .
Measured by European standards , time has passed very quickly since December 2003 , when the European Security Strategy was adopted - perhaps not necessarily when measured by objective standards , but it can be said that the European Security Strategy has made significant practical progress during this time .
There are some achievements to boast of , but I will not enumerate the different civilian and military missions here .
However , what we can show , structurally , is that , for the last year or so we have had a civilian control and planning instrument on the Council side and that there is now a clear chain of command from the building over there right down to those who have to carry out operations on the ground .
From the military perspective , we have strengthened operational capability beyond the use of NATO capabilities in accordance with the Berlin Plus Agreement .
We have made the Battle Groups , which are supposed to work on rotation , operable .
We have also carried out operations that we can declare successful , such as the missions in the area of the rule of law in Georgia and other similar missions .
However , there are some tasks that still have to be undertaken and where , in my opinion , there are still deficits , and it does not make the Security Strategy any poorer if we list these points .
When measured by the population figures for the EU Member States , there is an imbalance in the contributions to the missions , particularly in the civilian area .
We therefore propose that the Member States be obliged - whether morally or by other means - to issue action plans detailing what staff capabilities they can make available to the European Union should it become necessary , including statements on the career prospects of people who return to their own country after serving on EU missions .
In the long term , we cannot manage the agonising mechanism of providing troops for military actions such as Darfur and Chad , as we have done up to this point .
We are therefore suggesting alternative options .
We are also making several suggestions for dealing with the helicopter crisis and increasing the availability of helicopters .
In the long term , it makes no sense for us in the European Union to be flying around in 24 different types of helicopter .
In addition , there are new developments that we must consider as we reflect further on the Security Strategy .
Terrorist activity has brought about a blurring of the boundaries between internal and external borders .
Securing energy supply through diplomatic , economic and technical - and I am deliberately not saying military - means must be tackled .
Securing sensitive infrastructures against electronic attacks is something we have become aware of .
All these things need to be included in our consideration of aspects of the Security Strategy that may need to be expanded upon .
Mr Solana , the EU High Representative , has a specific mandate from the Council to think about such things .
We support him in that .
We would hope to see the result of these deliberations towards the end of the year in the form of a White Paper so that there is a common reference point for European discussion , not only for discussion between Mr Solana and the governments , not only between him and us , not only in the national parliaments , but also in the interests of the European public , from Poland to Portugal .
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy . - Mr President , let me start by thanking Parliament for inviting me to this important debate on the European Union 's foreign policy , security and defence in the plenary sitting of the European Parliament .
However , before entering into the substance , let me at once condemn the terrorist attack against the Danish Embassy in Islamabad on Monday and express my condolences to the Danes and Pakistanis and the families of the dead and injured .
Let us remember them and in particular those who suffered there .
I was in Islamabad not long ago and I would like to report on that trip , if the sitting allows me the time .
I wish to thank the two rapporteurs , Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne , for their reports .
I think that there are many excellent points in these reports on how we can strengthen the European Union 's overall impact around the world , in line with our values , in line with our interests .
I would like to congratulate them and reassure them , and all of you , that we will take as many of the remarks as possible into consideration because I think they are very constructive , very positive and because of that they will be considered by me .
This is a very important session and I would like to address some of the issues which are in both reports .
In the time allowed me I would like to talk about those issues that are more pertinent today on the international affairs agenda , to see how we can contribute to the resolution of the problems of today .
I should like to say a couple of words about the Treaty that has been referred to by the rapporteurs .
In both reports there are many references to the Treaty of Lisbon and it is very clear why .
Those reports ask for more efficiency .
The main point of the Treaty is to make the European Union 's work more efficient , more visible , especially in foreign and security policy .
I am convinced that the Treaty will solve many of the problems identified in the report in particular by Mr Kuhne .
The first priority for all of us is to get the Treaty ratified .
We all still have to work in that direction in the coming days .
I would like to underline that the Slovenian Presidency was mandated by the December European Council to take forward the work on preparing for the smooth entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty .
The work , as you know , has been guided by a few basic principles that we share .
The starting point of all this discussion is the Treaty itself .
It has to be respected in full .
The second thing is that the overall aim is that the Treaty enters into force as previously agreed and that means on 1 January 2009 if things can go smoothly .
Many aspects of the Treaty are of fundamental interest to you , to the European Parliament and - as we are talking about foreign and security policy - on that particular issue .
Both the Presidency and the Commission and myself have had the opportunity to discuss many of these issues with some of you , and I would like to guarantee that I will continue to do so from my time here today until the moment the Treaty enters into force .
It is vital to my mind that the three main institutions work together to ensure the smooth implementation of the Treaty .
Let me say a word about the European External Action Service .
As you know , I have a mandate as High Representative in Office from Declaration 15 of the Treaty to carry out preparatory work with the Commission and with the Member States .
I am doing that .
I am implementing this mandate with the clear objective of having the decision to establish the EAS adopted as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Treaty .
Mr Kuhne mentioned the European Security Strategy .
Let me make some comments on how I see the situation today .
The mandate that I received , the mandate from the Council last December , asked me to produce another report by December 2008 .
I will follow up with discussions with you all in order to obtain the best modifications necessary .
The strategy has proved very useful .
That has been recognised by the rapporteur and I thank him for that .
In the last four years I think it has been an instrument that has done good service .
The document was short but at the same time it is a document which is readable and therefore I think it has complied with this purpose .
I think that this strategy reflects our values , it reflects our principles , it reflects how we should come back to foreign and security policy .
I think the task mandated by the European Council last December is not about changing the text ; it is more about improving the text and complementing it wherever possible .
It is important to reflect on the international situation at the moment it was written - remember it was 2003 .
Things have taken place in this period of time - probably not fundamental enough to change the content of the strategy - but they complement the issues from this period .
Lessons have been learned and debates have taken place in Parliament and in the institutions .
Therefore I consider the input from Parliament to be very valuable , also through the report of the rapporteur , Mr Kuhne , which is most welcome .
I will report orally to the European Council in two weeks ' time about this issue , how the work is being done .
At that moment I will get something back from the Member States on the thinking about this issue and I will listen to you and all the comments you have made today .
There will then be further discussion and an informal meeting of Foreign Ministers - the Gymnich - in the month of September and we will continue talking about these issues among ourselves here in Parliament .
I think that the timing is very important .
December 2008 will be the fifth anniversary of the ESS .
Hopefully by then the Lisbon Treaty will be ratified , therefore improving the coherence of our action .
On the key threats that the strategy contemplates , I think those identified in 2003 were the right ones .
I think we would agree on that .
Weapons of mass destruction , terrorism , organised crime , regional conflicts - basically those have not changed .
It is still as relevant today , as I said , and we have to continue fighting actively along these lines .
The strategy was based on an analysis of the major global challenges at that time , but today , as I said , some are more relevant than others five years ago , and we also have new ones .
Remember - as has been mentioned already by the rapporteurs - climate change and its effects on international security , energy security - which now has to be contemplated in depth - were not contemplated in the strategy .
The same applies to migration - illegal migration in particular - and information security .
They were not contemplated , and should be now .
We have to take those developments into account .
Let me say a word also about the ESDP , which the rapporteur mentioned .
I think we can say without exaggeration that it has been a success .
It has been an important and very visible part of the CFSP .
Over the last five years - and it is good to recognise that - we have deployed more than 15 missions - in fact 17 .
We now have 14 of them - civilian and military - in action on three continents : Europe - in the Balkans , Africa , and the Middle East and Asia .
That is well recognised in the reports and I appreciate that very much .
However , Mr Kuhne 's report highlights some of the challenges and shortfalls we face in the ESDP and I agree with most of the things that have been said .
We are working on it : we are taking into account the lessons learned from the missions ; we are adapting our structures , both on the civilian and on the military side ; we are trying to make it so that there is more civilian and military cooperation , i.e. to have a comprehensive approach , which I think is also the intention of the report .
Good progress was made at last week 's Council meeting with the Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers .
An important decision was taken .
The rapporteur Mr Kuhne mentioned the key word ' helicopters ' , which , as you know , is one of the difficulties that the international community is facing now with regard to crisis management operations .
The capabilities we need are not here and the capabilities we have are not ready or not the most suitable for the challenges of today .
The decision for the Defence Agency to concentrate on that tactical issue of helicopters is operational from today and I hope very much that you will receive information from the military in the European Union .
That is something that I hope will be tackled in a coherent manner .
Let me say a few words about the situation in the world today : the hot spots and the things we are trying to resolve .
Let me start with the Western Balkans .
As you know there are still elements to be resolved in the Western Balkans .
What happened at the elections on Sunday in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is something that should make us think .
However , I should like to report to you that , since the last time we spoke , two important things have taken place in Serbia : the SAA has been signed with the Serbs and elections have taken place .
I think the results of the elections have something to do with our behaviour and let us hope that we can have a government in Serbia that will look to the European perspective of Serbia .
Let me say a word about Kosovo .
In Kosovo , as you know , by 15 June the global package of laws , including the constitution that was promised from the day of the independence of Kosovo , will be operational .
By that time we would like to have the situation on the ground moving in the right direction , i.e. EULEX moving in the right direction .
We are in permanent contact with the Secretary-General of the United Nations to see how this can be done and I hope very much that in a few days I will be able to report to you that progress has been made .
It is more than natural that I say a word about Georgia .
I am going to Georgia tomorrow morning .
I will be visiting Tbilisi and the authorities there .
I will also visit Abkhazia .
It is very important that we also visit Abkhazia to try to establish direct contact between the two sides in the framework of the Friends of the Secretary-General for the moment and see whether another , more active , format can be put in place .
I do not think that we will be able to resolve everything this week , but I hope very much that we will make a positive and constructive contribution .
I should report to you in addition on the situation in Lebanon , where important events have also recently taken place .
I , together with the President of Parliament , had the privilege to be there that Sunday .
It was a very moving moment when the agreement was reached .
General Suleiman is now the President after 18 months of instability .
The building where we were that afternoon had been closed and was now open .
I hope that the decision that was reached in Doha in Qatar will allow the evolution of Lebanon towards peace and to an election in 2009 .
As you know , this agreement is not perfect : it has positive elements but it also has elements that are not so positive .
Let us hope that our help and coherence in our actions in the months to come will help further the process , because , at the moment , it is still not complete .
The Prime Minister has been reappointed .
Mr Siniora is a dignified man , a man we should respect .
He is in charge of the government now .
Let us hope that he will be able to arrive safely to the election process in the middle of 2009 .
I would like to talk about many other things , but with this speech - and I think I have exceeded my time - I have given you at least an idea of the issues I will be tackling during the next few months .
I would also like to tell you that I will be Tehran .
I have not been there since June 2006 .
Since that time I have had many meetings with the leaders of Tehran . However , I have decided , together with the six countries involved in these negotiations , to go back to Tehran to meet its leaders .
I will carry with me an upgraded offer from the one that we made in 2006 .
I do not expect miracles but I think it is important for us to continue extending a hand and to make it clear that we have a twin-track approach : negotiations to solve the basic issues , in particular the nuclear issue , but , at the same time , to continue using what the Security Council has to offer .
( Applause )
We thank you , High Representative , for your speech and we wish you well for all your dangerous journeys .
I think the safest place for you to be is the European Parliament .
It must always be a pleasure for you to be here !

Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , Mr Solana , ladies and gentlemen , if , as we hope , the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force on 1 January 2009 , this will mark the start of a new era for the Union 's Common Foreign and Security Policy .
This policy was a gamble , but it is precisely this that allows the European Union to prove itself as a global player .
Despite considerable progress , Europe still has a long way to go before , as an economic giant but a political dwarf , it can become a global political power punching at its economic weight .
As Mr Saryusz-Wolski indicated in his excellent report , Europe 's role in the world is still far from reaching its true potential .
In Israel , Palestine and all over the world , our interlocutors are demanding to see more from Europe .
We should listen to their demands .
In order to be credible with these partners , the Union must not only speak with one voice , but also have the necessary instruments to make itself heard .
Its foreign policy must have democratic legitimacy , which will be afforded by the parliamentary scrutiny introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
Ladies and gentlemen , we want a credible defence for Europe , not so that we can go to war , naturally , but so that we can ensure peace and more importantly help the world 's poorest .
Our common security is no longer limited to military protection against external attack .
It also covers energy supply , climate change , migration management and the promotion of human rights and civil liberties .
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is committed to ensuring that all aspects of this common security are taken into account .
We are of the view that the EU 's foreign policy must first of all focus on our closest neighbours .
That is why we are asking the Commission and the Council to work towards strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy and bringing stability to the situation in the Western Balkans .
Specifically , it is imperative that we continue the dialogue with Serbia while continuing to support Kosovo .
The collaboration between the Council and Parliament has not always been easy when it comes to these matters .
The Council has not always been open and transparent enough for our liking , but our relations have progressed a great deal nonetheless .
The Council Presidency and Mr Solana now recognise that the EU 's Common Foreign and Security Policy will be stronger and fairer if it has the backing of Parliament .
On behalf of the PPE-DE Group , I would like to ask the Council to go further , to join Parliament in discussions on the appointment of the first High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission and to engage in proper consultation with them .
We would also like Parliament to be consulted on how to establish a European External Action Service .
In terms of the implementation of the European Security Strategy , our group calls on the High Representative to publish a White Paper in order to assess the strategy introduced in 2003 .
In the context of the future Treaty , we are calling for a reinforcement of the budgetary powers of Parliament in all areas of EU spending .
We are also lobbying for instruments of parliamentary scrutiny and cooperation with the Council .
Ladies and gentlemen , in a world where regional powers hold sway , the European Union must seize the unique opportunities represented by the new instruments of the Treaty to establish itself as a political power which is both more homogeneous , and therefore more able to make itself heard on the international stage , and firmer with its partners .
Increased parliamentary scrutiny will make this policy even more effective , because it will be more democratic and more transparent .

Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Kuhne on his report , especially since it applies a very comprehensive definition of security and therefore defines a comprehensive range of security policy instruments which , naturally , includes the military , although it is not based exclusively on military measures .
Mr Wiersma will go into this in more detail .
I would also like to thank Mr Saryusz-Wolski very much for his effective cooperation , which we recently experienced in the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
I would like to mention two matters .
The first - and we have already discussed it today in our group , as Mr Schulz has already mentioned - is the question of energy security and common energy policy .
We are not interested in criticising bilateral agreements that were concluded in an era when there was no discussion about a common security policy .
However , such agreements are still being concluded now , and especially for the future , it is important to make it clear that , when such agreements are concluded , they must be embedded in a common security policy and a common energy policy .
Today I spoke with a prominent representative from Azerbaijan who is here in Parliament . He said , ' Friends , you present quite differently from China and Russia ' .
This is not acceptable !
We must appear united if we want to pursue common goals , and he was right to point this out .
This brings me to my second matter , which we will deal with in more detail in the Brok report .
There is a lot of talk now about the Union for the Mediterranean .
As a group , we are calling for a Union for the Black Sea region too .
This is also an important region , in which we must do a great deal , particularly in our own interests .
I thank Mr Saryusz-Wolski for having addressed this matter .
The proposal , as we have it from Poland and Sweden , is good .
We support it , but it does not go far enough .
We must go further if we really want to represent our political interests in this region in particular .
Obviously , we support this , in connection with this report and will discuss it further in connection with the Brok report , so that our common neighbours in the east and the south become co-advisers , involved with us in managing and implementing the European goals .
Finally , a remark on the diplomatic service - the High Representative , Mr Solana , also mentioned it .
There is a lot of discussion about it and we will also produce a report on it , but let me make one thing clear : we need a diplomatic service that is viable and is acceptable to the Commission , the Council and the Member States , one that is efficient and can really take its political responsibility seriously , including its responsibility to this Parliament .
For us , the critical thing is to make it clear that this service - however it is organised - is , of course , responsible to the European Parliament through the High Representative .
A final remark on Iran : Mr Solana , I wish you good luck in Iran .
Obviously we are taking the same approach , which is to be flexible , but to state clearly that we do not want any more atomic weapons , especially in that region .
They would create further insecurity , not more security .
All the best , then , in successfully establishing these fundamental principles .
( Applause )
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Solana , the reports by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne are important pieces of work , and discussing every aspect of these within such a short period of time would be impossible .
For that reason , I shall be focussing on three aspects .
Firstly , the role of our Parliament in foreign and defence matters ; secondly , the very great responsibility of all Member States to establish a coherent and effective foreign and security policy ; and , finally , the need for us to continue combating the proliferation of nuclear weapons and working towards general arms control .
The fact that we are holding this debate with these participants here this afternoon is excellent evidence of the degree to which we , the European Parliament , have succeeded in assuming a greater role in foreign and security policy , even though , according to the current treaties , that was not initially to be the case .
It is our perseverance that has led to this , as well as the understanding which has been shown to us by both the Commission and the High Representative and which led to an interinstitutional agreement that makes debates such as this possible .
We shall of course make use of every possibility offered by the Treaty of Lisbon in order to continue playing our role to the full .
Incidentally , it is also due to the fact that we have never pushed too far , that we have taken care ' not to overplay our hand ' , as they say in English , that we have been able to fill this role .
It is clear that , as Mr Swoboda emphasised , an effective foreign and security policy is only possible if all 27 Member States and the governments of these Member States , including the large ones , take concerted action .
We can indeed deliver fine speeches here , everyone can deliver fine speeches here , but if Heads of State or Government , prime ministers or Ministers of Foreign Affairs go off and do things differently on the world stage then it is not possible , it will not succeed .
The responsibility of our Member States is therefore particularly great , not only in the field I have mentioned , but also to ensure that their words are followed by action .
We had painful experience of this when preparing for the intervention in Chad , for example .
An affirmative decision was made and then it took weeks to gather the troops and all the material .
Such things do great damage to our credibility , and I hope , therefore , that we shall all make huge efforts to ensure the least possible chance of this happening again in the future .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will not repeat all the congratulations or re-emphasise the points on which we actually agree : that is , the call for a coherent foreign and security policy , such as Mr Saryusz-Wolski has formulated for us , and of course the question of parliamentary scrutiny and transparency .
When we return to our national Member States we notice in all our discussions that , the more the European Union becomes involved in foreign and security policy , the more we wish to and must promote these instruments for transparency and legitimacy amongst the population of our own country .
I would like to address the contentious points that no one else has mentioned yet .
Mr Verheugen , in the first debate we discussed the draft of Mr Kuhne 's report with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner .
She , like my group , emphasised that it is beneficial that we keep on thinking about this , that we not only discuss reworking the European Security Strategy but also try to formulate a joint mission statement , namely the question of human security and the responsibility to protect .
Anyone who has been following what has happened since then will have been aware of the strange coalition of the conservatives under Mr von Wogau and the communists under Mr Pflüger .
The relevant passage has been deleted , with the support of both groups , and we will make a fresh request for it to be included , since if we do not meet this political challenge , we will lose our credibility with regard to the way we deal with this topic , that is , with conflict prevention , but also with the question of what we do about Darfur , Chad and other conflicts that we should be wary of .
The second thing , which I find absurd , even though we have not yet reached consensus on it , is that the conservatives under Mr von Wogau are requesting that we take the US national security strategy into account in the future within the framework of the European Security Strategy and our reworking of it .
That is completely absurd , because this policy has run aground and we know that the US Administration has failed with this escalation , this unilateralism , and that it has cost many lives .
To then say that we should absorb this into our future European foreign policy - I find that more than absurd !
Thirdly , I would like to raise an extremely important matter : proliferation .
Mr Solana , I also wish you every success .
We need dialogue , including with Iran , but I would ask my fellow Members this : when we are talking about energy security which , after all , is part of wider security - is it the correct response when Mr Sarkozy , as the future President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union , announces that he wants to place nuclear technology on the world market without restriction and with no means of monitoring it ?
What happens to our credibility then ?
Firstly , we are not effecting nuclear disarmament , which we are supposed to be doing .
Secondly , we are circulating this technology even though we know that it can always be abused from a military aspect .
I believe we are making a mistake in this and therefore we will also be submitting an amendment .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( GA ) Mr President , cooperation and coordination on the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) is important between EU Member States .
There are new global threats and I believe that the Lisbon Treaty and the CFSP will move us closer to disabling those threats .
The CFSP is more than policy implementation .
It entails 27 Member States working together to ensure peace , human rights , the rule of law and democracy throughout the world .
The Lisbon Treaty contains these same principle and they fully conform to Irish values .
In congratulating both of the rapporteurs on their work in this particular area and taking into account our experience over the last number of years , it is particularly important that we are cognisant of the fact that too often Europe has spoken with great words but failed to live up to the expectation .
That is why , as we look forward to the development of new policies , without in any way anticipating what the outcome of the referendum in Ireland will be - which I hope will be positive towards the adoption and ratification of the Lisbon Treaty - we must remember always that unless the Member States , acting collectively , can agree to common positions and to moving forward , fine words will be spoken but action will fail .
The most recent example of that was what happened in Chad .
Despite the horrors of what we saw with regard to the refugees on the Chad and Sudanese border , despite the desire of every Member State to be seen to do something , our failure to deliver the logistics of bringing the forces into Chad highlighted our shortcomings .
When we speak about the future threats , future opportunities and , indeed , the future dangers , we must always be cognisant of the fact that Europe is the greatest peace project of all .
The work that we do , and what we have achieved and built in the European Union since 1958 , has proven that acting collectively , cooperating with tolerance and understanding of different points of view is a far greater power and tool than any weapons we can put at our disposal .
But that is not to be naive and to say that we do not need to have resources at our disposal .
However , we must keep in mind that all Member States must act in unanimity in finding new foreign and defence policies for the future , and that if one country says ' no ' , they cannot be diminished or demonised because of that .
Mr President , the two reports we are discussing are a clear sign of the advanced stage the militarisation of the European Union has reached .
I wish to address several aspects , for example the very close EU-NATO cooperation , which is absolutely fatal .
NATO is also an alliance for waging war and we are opposed to this close cooperation between the European Union and NATO .
Thank you again for clarifying that the Lisbon Treaty will bring fundamental changes in the military area .
That is an essential reason why we are against the Lisbon Treaty and I would like to point out that it has not yet been ratified and that I am hoping for a ' no ' in Ireland on 12 June .
Part of the Lisbon Treaty - which also appears in Mr Kuhne 's report - is that an independent EU military budget , known as the start-up fund , should be created .
We think this creates a whole host of problems .
Parliamentary scrutiny of ESDP missions is not guaranteed .
EU Battle Groups are supposed to be able to be deployed within 5-30 days and the German Bundestag cannot be involved within that timeframe .
It was not possible to achieve agreement on parliamentary scrutiny between all groups , partly because we demanded that all groups , including the smaller ones , should receive the appropriate information .
Apparently this Parliament does not want that .
The report calls for further armament projects .
We believe that this is wrong .
Previous EU missions must first be thoroughly evaluated .
This is long overdue .
French soldiers who were part of Operation Artemis in Congo used torture .
The operation in Chad is a disaster and the EULEX mission in Kosovo - supposedly a rule of law mission - has no legal basis .
The two reports are heading in completely in the wrong direction .
Therefore , we as a group have put forward a minority opinion .
It has now become evident what the French Presidency plans to do in the military realm .
There will be a further push for militarisation ; marine and air Battle Groups have already been mentioned .
We do not want a military European Union .
We do not want a military alliance .
We want a civil European Union .
For these reasons , we say a definite ' no ' to these two reports .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , both of these reports assume that the Lisbon Treaty / European Constitution will be ratified , despite the fact that the result of the Irish referendum will not be known until 12 June .
But of course this Parliament has already decided that it will ignore the Irish referendum if it results in a ' no ' vote .
The European Union does not want its foreign policy and military ambitions to be subject to the will of the people of Europe 's nation states by means of referenda , because it knows very well that they will reject those ambitions if given a choice .
And what ambitions they are .
These reports show how the EU intends to build its military forces by such means as combining multinational forces , building common command and control structures , adopting common equipment and systems procurement policies , and implementing common communication systems .
They envisage combining existing multinational forces and that there should be a standing force under EU command .
And there we have the beginnings of a European standing army .
These plans endanger NATO and undermine the nation states ' positions within the United Nations - which the European Union seeks to usurp .
I recently attended a security conference in Brussels in which someone posed the question : who fears the European Union ?
Meaning , of course , that without the threat of military force , no-one will take the EU 's foreign policy pretensions seriously .
During the latter part of the Second World War , one of Stalin 's staff said that the Pope disapproved of certain of his foreign policy actions .
To which Stalin replied : ' and how many divisions does the Pope have ? '
The European Union intends to have its divisions in order to enforce its will and make itself feared on the world stage .
And if we want to know what that will look like , just imagine the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy repeated with guns , tanks and aeroplanes .
The only people in Europe being allowed a say on this are the Irish in their referendum of 12 June .
One of the key factors influencing the minds of the Irish will be to preserve their historical policy of neutrality .
But do they realise that if Lisbon is ratified neutrality will end and they will become subject to the foreign policy and military ambitions of the European Union ?
But they will not only lose their neutrality , they will find themselves helping to pay for soldiers and armaments to undertake military operations that they may not approve of .
They should seriously consider these things before deciding which way to vote in their referendum .
The British Government and Houses of Parliament have shamefully betrayed the British people by denying them a referendum on Lisbon .
Irish neutrality is at stake , but so is the very ability of Britain to defend itself .
( SK ) Ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by saying that I welcome the 2006 annual report and the progress achieved in the structure of the report .
The European Parliament must adopt a more resolute position and act as one in the issues concerned that the Council should deal with systematically .
In this regard , I welcome the provisions concerning closer cooperation between the European Parliament and the national parliaments , as well as the increased responsibility of the national parliaments and Member State governments with regard to strategic decisions .
I believe that representatives of the new Member States will find their place , too , in the new structure of the European diplomatic services .
In my opinion , thanks to the Lisbon Treaty Europe will present a more united front in the area of external relations .
It is important for the Member States to increase the frequency of consultations with their partners as well as with the EU High Representative , in particular with regard to adopting fundamental decisions .
The single legal personality of the Union will make it possible for the European Union to conclude international agreements and join international organisations .
When adopting these binding decisions , the European citizens ' concerns and expectations regarding issues of an international nature should also be taken into account .
Mr President , allow me to take my turn by briefly congratulating those who have spoken on behalf of the parliamentary groups .
I think that in general terms , while there has not been unanimity , there has been a broad consensus on many of the matters that we have covered in the first part of the debate .
( FR ) I should first of all like to thank Mr Daul from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
You expressed yourself clearly on the objectives of the ESS revision and on the aims of the Treaty of Lisbon in general .
I fully share your position and believe that it is crucial to strengthen the voice and human dimension of the Union .
I honestly believe that Europe has a duty not only to its citizens , but to those outside Europe .
The whole world is voicing its hope that Europe will adopt a clearer approach and take more effective action .
I therefore fully share the comments of the PPE-DE Group and will make every effort to bring about effective cooperation with all of the institutions between now and the entry into force of the Treaty .
This is the mandate that was given to me under Article 15 of the Treaty , and I will endeavour to fulfil this obligation .
I would also like to reply to Mr Swoboda - not to disagree with him but , on the contrary , to say that many of the things he has said are very much to my way of thinking and to the way I would like to see things moving .
I think the cooperation you mentioned between civilians and the military is fundamental .
We are in the business of crisis management and not in any other business .
In crisis management all the instruments should be at the disposal of the European Union to make the utmost of its capabilities .
But , again , the most important thing is to have political will .
We may have the capabilities , but if we do not have political will we have nothing .
We may not have the capabilities in any case .
Therefore , we have to work in both directions , with capabilities but also with political will .
The construction of political will is something that everybody in this beautiful building has to work on , together with the other institutions of the European Union .
Let me say a word about the report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski .
There were paragraphs in the report with which I agree from A to Z. I would like to underline the paragraphs on Afghanistan for instance because Afghanistan is a very important issue on which we have responsibilities .
I did not have the opportunity to mention in my introductory remarks that for me - and for us I hope - Afghanistan is one of the challenges that we have on the table and we have to be able to construct a resolution that has to be political .
Therefore , what you said about the police mission in the report is very important .
We need members of the police there .
As you know , at the last European Foreign Affairs Council we agreed to double the number of people deployed .
But I would also like to underline what you said about quality .
It is true that when we talk about the rule of law , police and judges they are not at our disposal - they are working in their national Member States on other issues and therefore we have to see how we can go from here to the time when we will have at our disposal a European group of policemen , group of judges and group of social actors that could be deployed rapidly .
That may be possible with the military because , fortunately , if they are not in a crisis-management operation , they may be available for deployment .
We have to think about that and not only think but also find answers to those questions .
I should like to say that , on the whole , the speeches have been very constructive .
I should like to comment on the paragraph on human security .
Mrs Beer , you know very well that I am very attached to that concept .
Marie Colvin is one of my friends and I have written some of those pieces with her .
I think that is a concept that illuminates much of our modern thinking as far as security is concerned .
Therefore , it does not matter what we call it , the important thing is what we do .
The name is important but what we do is more important than the name .
I think that all the reports are illuminated by that belief : that security is something that goes beyond a classical concept .
But , with respect , I have to disagree with some of the remarks , starting with the remark by the representative of the Commission .
I really do not think that the security strategy has to be revised because it had a very narrow concept of security .
I do not think this is a good statement .
I think , concerning the security strategy written in 2003 , that most of the limits there are the same elements , the same challenges , the same problems that we have today .
We may have to complement and we may have to act , but I do not characterise the strategy as a narrow vision of security .
On the contrary , it is the most open-minded approach that the European Union has ever had on this problem .
For the sake of clarity , I think that what we have to do is not to write a new text but to maintain as much as possible of the core , i.e. the mandate we have , and try to add elements .
For example many of you have mentioned the question of energy security - which is important - and the question of the consequences of climate change in all its dimensions , the question of how to tackle the responsibility that we have with disasters that are natural and not manmade , for which we have resources and capabilities that have been put in place to combat such dramatic events .
Concerning proliferation : I have spoken about that on almost every occasion I have been given the opportunity - the risks and the importance that issue has for all of us .
I think if we were to pick two horizontal issues we have to tackle , one would be climate change and the other would be proliferation and disarmament .
Those are the two main issues that may put at risk much of what we value in life .
Therefore , I agree with that .
I would like to say a few words to my dear friend , Brian Crowley .
I think the important thing is to deliver , and I agree with him .
However , take the example of Chad .
I do not know whether that was the best example you could have chosen .
I was in Chad a couple of weeks ago .
I went to the capital , to the second city and to Goz Beida , where the Irish Battalion is deployed with very high spirits and enormous professionalism .
That is something that should make us proud .
I feel proud of the work the Irish Battalion is doing in the middle of the savannah , trying to help the displaced people in the refugee camps , with tremendous generosity .
I applaud the Irish soldiers who are there , who have a very generous attitude and are fully determined to make things better on the ground , which is the objective of the mission .
I would like to thank you , Mr President , and all the parliamentary groups and I hope very much that in the time we have ahead of us , as we approach the end of the year 2008 , we will be able to work constructively towards making the dream of so many citizens of the European Union a reality - the implementation of the Treaty in order to have a Europe that has a presence in the international community , in the world , that is proportional to our ideas , our principles , our capabilities and our standard of living .

( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Solana , I would first like to thank Mr Kuhne for his report and for the way he went about it , which meant that we were able to achieve unity on almost all points .
Mr Solana , a few months ago , you attended Mr Polin 's funeral in Bayonne .
He was the first soldier to have lost his life in a European operation .
For me , this was a very moving event , a very sad event , which caused me to think very carefully again about when we actually deploy soldiers and under what conditions .
This is also , at the same time , my answer to Mrs Beer and the concept of human security .
The concept of human security is certainly an interesting one - including for development aid .
Without security , there is no development .
However , I am not sure that this concept is appropriate for the European Union 's security and defence policy , as it would be possible to take it to mean that we should intervene in every case , all over the world .
That raises expectations that it may not be possible to fulfil .
When people are in need , they do not look for the one who has the best intentions but for the one who can actually help them .
This is the weakness in this concept , and nothing would be worse than raising false hopes here .
My group will therefore be voting against mentioning this principle .
The French Presidency is ahead of us and along with it , there will most probably also be some important decisions to make .
I have mentioned this already : more and more soldiers are being sent on dangerous missions .
We have a responsibility to ensure that that they also have the necessary equipment , the best possible equipment for these operations .
That is not yet the case in many areas .
We have shortcomings in telecommunications and - this is extremely important - in the civil area and in civil operations .
We have deficits in reconnaissance and navigation .
Here I expect concrete suggestions to be made so that , in the future , there will be closer cooperation and so that such projects and shortcomings will be solved together in the European way .
The report in front of us demands that Eurocorps be permanently subject to the European Union . In my opinion , this would be a great step forward compared to Battle Groups , which are only ever made available to the European Union for a six-month period .
I am calling for the European Security and Defence College that Mr Kuhne mentioned to become more than just a virtual college so that it is given the means with which to perform its task .
( NL ) Mr President , I should like to make a number of comments on the European Security Strategy in the report by my esteemed colleague Mr Kuhne .
He worked on it of course with the full support of my group , and we believe the result is excellent .
Nevertheless , I should also like to bring a number of observations to the attention of the High Representative .
This Security Strategy is in place and was developed in 2003 as a major innovation .
The essence of the Strategy of course remains in place .
What we are discussing now are adaptations to a transformed international agenda .
Effective multilateralism is an important principle .
The combination of civil and military aspects is of major importance .
Modern threat analysis is also important .
There are many positive examples of how the European Union , under the direction of Mr Solana , has dealt with this in the past few years .
It is actually the same approach , but a broader agenda is being applied .
Everyone is saying that you cannot just talk about terrorism and about traditional security problems : you must also examine the way in which problems relating to energy security and climate threat are important to our security agenda .
That is the broad agenda .
I should nevertheless like to stand up for the narrow agenda .
It is not just about the security of states ; it is about the security of people also .
I think it a good thing that Mr Kuhne has tried to spark this debate here in Parliament , just as we had a whole discussion on the ' responsibility to protect ' in the UN , another discussion that concerns individuals .
We must indeed examine how this can be incorporated into our concept , and I therefore think it a shame that the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats does not wish to participate in shaping these ideas .
When we talk about human security , we mean not that there should be automatic intervention in each situation in which there is a possible threat to human security , but rather that we want better account to be taken of this important element .
With regard to this broad agenda , it is also important that , thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon - and let us hope and pray that , on 12 June , Ireland will vote in favour of this Treaty , which is what we are assuming - the European Union will be able to work with a broad agenda , because the new High Representative , who must be called as such because of my own country , will also be Vice-President of the European Commission and will therefore coordinate this broad agenda effectively .
Finally , I have one further observation regarding the United States .
There are to be elections , and we do not know who the two candidates will be .
In any case , it is clear that with whomever it may be - and I hope of course that it is Barack Obama - it will be easier to cooperate on a number of security issues .
A particular example is the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
John McCain has had interesting things to say on this subject .
Perhaps , at the end of the year , it will be time to present further initiatives , new agreements : with regard to the multilateralisation of the nuclear fuel cycle , for example .
I hope that the High Representative is willing to make efforts to achieve this .
( HU ) Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , firstly I would like to congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne on their comprehensive reports ; they have done some outstanding work .



One of the most important findings of Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report is that the stability of the Western Balkans is the European Union 's number-one priority today .
I completely agree with this .
In the case of Kosovo , what is at stake is no less than the credibility of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
The antecedents are not too encouraging : although all the Member States have supported the Ahtisaari plan , they have still not agreed on whether to recognise Kosovo .
But an even greater problem is the fact that there is also still no agreement on whether UNMIK 's powers should be handed over to EULEX .
But if this does not happen , the European Union cannot fulfil its own pledges , and this undermines its credibility .
Very important tasks for the EULEX mission are the creation of constitutionality , the introduction of a functioning market economy , the reinforcement of Kosovo 's multi-racial nature , and the building of trust between the peoples living there .
The European Union cannot leave Kosovo to its own devices .
Our policy for the Western Balkans must rest on three pillars .
Firstly , we must offer those countries a credible European perspective , we must examine the conditions strictly and we must bear witness to consistency .
It would be a great mistake if we momentarily failed to give the conditions political consideration or if we inconsistently offered concessions to countries that do not cooperate with us - concessions that we do not give to those that do cooperate .
These things will certainly continue to threaten the credibility of the European Union .
The European Union wants to play a global role , and rightly so , but this will just be wishful thinking until it is capable of guaranteeing the possibility of peace , stability and progress in its own immediate vicinity . Thank you .
Welcome
We are pleased to welcome to the official gallery the parliamentary delegations from Armenia , Azerbaijan , Georgia , Moldova and Ukraine , along with representatives of the democratic opposition in Belarus .
The delegation from Georgia is led by the Speaker of Georgia 's Parliament , Mrs Burjanadze .
These delegations have come to Brussels to take part in the conference on the European Neighbourhood Policy to be held in the European Parliament today and tomorrow .
We warmly welcome them and are delighted to welcome them to this joint debate .
( Applause )
2006 Annual report on the CFSP - Annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP ( continuation of debate )
We will continue with the joint debate on the report by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski , on the 2006 annual report on the CFSP , and the report by Helmut Kuhne , on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP .
( FR ) Mr President , it is a pleasure for me to speak before these delegations since we have such close ties with them .
It is precisely on the South Caucasus , would you believe , High Commissioner , that I would like to focus my intervention .
We heard the good news that you will be going to Georgia for a couple of days tomorrow .
It was high time that this happened and I thank you for that .
You will also be going to Abkhazia and on that point , you explained that the weekend might not be enough time to resolve the issue .
If you manage to do it in a weekend , I will be the first to congratulate you .
This is a hard task , we know , but the most important thing is that the European Union is engaging in it .
In my opinion , this is almost a test of the maturity of EU foreign policy .
We know that Russia , which is one of our partners , is now involved in the conflict .
According to the UN report , Georgia has agreed to suspend UAV flights over Abkhazia .
However , yesterday we learnt that Russia has deployed its military forces to supposedly build railways .
If that is the case , I think it is too early to talk about peacekeeping forces .
This is therefore a difficult task .
You said that you were going to support Georgia 's peace plan , so my question to you , High Commissioner , is this : are you also going to support , as part of this peace plan , the introduction of an Abkhaz-Georgian civil police force supervised by the EU or the OSCE ?
This would be a real step forward , and one that we have been waiting for from the EU for a long time in this conflict , since this is a neighbouring country .
Therefore , the question that arises today , and which our fellow Members have just asked , is this : are we going to develop the Neighbourhood Policy as part of our foreign policy ?
( PL ) Mr President , may I remind you that in last year 's report from the Council on the main aspects and basic choices of Common Foreign and Security Policy , Parliament expressed deep disquiet at the announcement by the then Russian President , Vladimir Putin , that Russia was withdrawing from further participation in the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe .
Despite the express declaration by the European Parliament , the EU authorities took no serious action on this .
In July 2007 , however , the Russian State Duma unanimously passed an act suspending Russia 's participation in this Treaty .
There is no doubt that this fact is of fundamental importance for security in Europe , as Russia possesses the greatest conventional armed forces potential on our continent .
This is why I believe that the matter of getting the Russian Federation to re-accede to this international agreement is an important priority .
The authorities of the EU and its Member States should use all means available to them to bring this about , not least because in recent times Russian expenditure on arms has risen by 700 % .
( ES ) Mr President , Mr El Baradei , who is not someone who can be accused of being radical , said at the last Munich Conference on Security Policy that a 1 % reduction in arms expenditure could solve the hunger problems in the world .
The contribution that the European Union is making to achieving this goal is to ask the Member States for military expenditure to be increased , and as a result this civilisation has reached the immoral situation of having the highest arms expenditure in the world in 2006 , more than in the Cold War : 17 times more than we spend on international cooperation .
I think that we are going along the wrong path .
The militarisation of security has created a more unjust , more violent world .
You might remember that we were told that the immorality of the invasion of Iraq was going to resolve the problem of the Middle East and reduce the price of oil .
The evidence is conclusive .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think that we are on the wrong track .
We need to demilitarise security and go back to the old values of a Europe in which , in the midst of the Cold War , on foreign policy people like Willy Brandt and Olaf Palme were proposing the zero armament objective .
With regard to our link to North American security , it depends which administration we are talking about .
Or have our principles and values been the same as those of the Bush administration ?
Do you recall the CIA flights , the torture in Guantanamo , the death penalty , and the systematic violation of human rights throughout the world ?
No , ladies and gentlemen , I think that we need to move towards autonomous , denuclearised security , and a system that generates sufficient security to resolve the fundamental problems which , in addition to terrorism , are hunger , poverty and discrimination .
( SV ) Mr President , today 's debate was a foretaste of what is to come if the Treaty of Lisbon is adopted .
Increased militarisation , increased supranationality and increased costs for the EU at the expense of Member States ' independence .
The EU is now to represent us all .
The wishes of 27 states will become as of one .
I therefore look on in amazement as the European Parliament - which claims to be the champion of democracy - chooses a federalist course without respecting either Ireland 's referendum or intergovernmental cooperation .
The Treaty of Lisbon means a further step towards a common foreign minister , common military forces and a common intelligence service , in short , a common defence and foreign policy .
Citizens of Ireland , you are the only ones who have been given the opportunity to halt this dangerous development .
I urge to you to vote ' no ' on 12 June , just as we should do in Parliament tomorrow .
Mr President , I have a question for you .
How is it that the High Representative , Mr Solana , can come to this House and tell us a direct untruth ?
I sat here and heard him say that everyone wants a stronger European Union and a stronger CFSP .
I represent 4.2 million people in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom .
Not one of them has ever said that they want a stronger European Union or a stronger CFSP , though many have said to me they would like to see our country out of the European Union .
If you believe this is what the European people want , why will you not let them vote on the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty which are designed to deliver it ?
Have you forgotten that the French voted against it and the Dutch voted against it ?
Do you not know that 80 % of my constituents want a referendum and , if they were given it , at least 80 % of them would vote ' no ' ?
The British people that I represent want trade and cooperation in Europe , but they are absolutely opposed to political union and a European army .

( ES ) Mr President , cooperation between Parliament and the Council has significantly improved in recent years , as recognised in Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report , in particular thanks to the establishment of flexible mechanisms and the appearances by the President-in-Office of the Council , the High Representative and the Special Representatives .
However , the report also says , as the Chairman of my group , that this cooperation between Parliament and the Council could be improved , especially in terms of timing .
The report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski , whom I would like to congratulate on his work , includes a specific initiative : establishing an interinstitutional agreement from the beginning of next year , so that , on the basis of the guidelines of the new Treaty , stable and dynamic criteria for cooperation can be established .
High Representative , I would like to get an idea of your assessment of this proposal in the report .
Secondly , I would also like to thank the other rapporteur , Mr Kuhne , for his report on the European Security Strategy .
I think that what we need here is a long-term strategy that will enable us to deal with the new shape of the threats that we face , which can be revised when circumstances change , and in any case every five years , coinciding with Parliament 's legislative periods .
There have been some very remarkable speeches .
I do not think that it is a question of spending more , but while we have 3 parallel satellite systems - Mr von Wogau already referred to this today - 5 telecommunications systems , 23 armoured vehicle systems and 87 different arms programmes , we will not be able to continue to make progress along the line that we want to follow .
With the 27 Member States , the European Union has approximately 2 million soldiers , 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter planes .
I think that this is a sufficiently large force for us to be able to take serious action .
However , we have additional problems with sending a battalion to conflicts such as in Chad , where the aim is not to wage war but to provide protection in crisis situations and mediate in conflict situations .
Therefore , Mr President , I think that we need to contribute and mobilise all of our resources so that the European Union , with all of the capacity that it has , does not continue to be utterly irrelevant on the international stage .
Welcome
Ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to inform you that a delegation from the Japanese Parliament has arrived in the official gallery .
We would like to extend a warm welcome to them .
They are taking part in the 29th EP / Japan Interparliamentary Meeting that is being held in Brussels and Vienna from 2 to 6 June .
The Japanese delegation is led by Mr Taro Nakayama , a great friend of Europe , and is made up of seven members of the House of Representatives and two members of the House of Councillors .
This Interparliamentary Meeting has focused on climate change in order to promote a common approach based around the application of the Kyoto Protocol and what will come after it .
We are very happy with this fruitful , stable and continued cooperation with Japan , a country with which we share the basic values of democracy , respect for human rights and the principle of multilateral cooperation .
Therefore , welcome to our Japanese friends !
( Applause )
2006 Annual report on the CFSP - Annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP ( continuation of debate )
We will continue with the joint debate on the report by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski , on the 2006 annual report on the CFSP , and the report by Helmut Kuhne , on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP .


( PT ) I should like to congratulate Mr Kuhne on his excellent report and in particular for the insistence on introducing the Human Security concept in combination with the principle of the responsibility to protect - a concept which Mr Solana has also upheld here .
These have to be the twin pillars behind a European approach to crisis management missions .
On the one hand , deciding to intervene in a country under the ESDP must be based on an interpretation of the UN Charter that emphasises the responsibility to protect : the obligation to prevent genocide , war crimes , ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity .
On the other hand , if the Union finds itself involved in a crisis requiring the use of military means , it is essential for the use of force to be guided by the doctrine of human security .
This would mean that European troops would have to focus their efforts on setting up safe havens for non-combatant civilian populations , much more than on destroying the enemy with a view to military victory .
These two principles provide Europe with a coherent crisis management strategy at the beginning of the 21st century .
Amendment 1 by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament therefore reflects the moral , legal and operational demands we are facing in Afghanistan , Chad and Lebanon and that we will face in the future .
For these reasons , I find it regrettable that the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left rejected this amendment .
This reactionary alliance insists on turning a blind eye to the primacy of human rights - a concept that would reinforce the legitimacy of and popular support for ESDP missions .
Mr President , there are , I fear , two problems with the debate this afternoon .
The first is the claptrap that we hear from the far right about the Treaty of Lisbon .
The second is that there is a certain complacency about all those , including myself , who strongly defend the Common Foreign , Security and Defence Policy .
The purpose of a grand European security strategy is not to be admired , but to be followed , and too often the Council and the Member States have failed to follow their excellent strategy .
The UK and France have failed to deliver the promises of the St Malo Agreement .
Certain others have insisted on a miserly and self-defeating policy that military costs should lie where they fall .
What is the point of such a policy when the objective is to spread the burden ?
The fact is that only 20 % of our armed forces can actually fight .
Several of the ESDP missions are impoverished .
The absence of a European HQ for the ESDP fragments commands and impairs the pooling of resources .
The sad problem is that we too often fail to learn from our mistakes , and simply tweaking the security strategy will not make the difference .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have heard the CFSP programme , but it appears a little laughable coming from a Europe that cannot even manage to control its own external borders that are breached every day by thousands of illegal immigrants , traffickers and mafia members .
A security policy without a basis - if there is one , Mr Solana , please tell us what this basis is !
The reports continually mention climate change , but the danger of the possibility of military attacks , terrorist attacks of a biological or even nuclear nature is ignored , even though this danger is far more serious and perhaps real , in view of the threats voiced by Islamist terrorists .
Europe is weak in terms of political conclusions .
Look at the Black Sea , for example , which is a kind of chess-board on which there is no European policy .
This is despite the fact that upon this chess-board our energy future and our security future is decided .
Where is Europe 's political approach on this chess-board ?
The Lisbon Treaty will not offer anything more than the little that has been achieved : the lack of perspectives of a Europe that has no geopolitical vision .
Mr Solana , this is a void of 10 years of managing the foreign policy .
Over those past 10 years all you have achieved is a void !
( EL ) Mr President , the two reports clearly present the escalation of the EU 's aggressiveness and imperialist plans .
They set out a series of priorities for 2008 , the goal of which is the economic , political and military advancement of European capital in the world .
The EU also aims to plunder peoples and countries , either independently or , where that is not possible , with the assistance of the USA and ΝΑΤΟ .
In the first report , one of the salient points is interference and starting wars under the statutory smokescreen of excuses such as the fight against terrorism and the ' protection of human rights and democracy ' .
Paragraph 15 , Mr Solana , contains the typical , unacceptable and dangerous distinction between democracies and non-democracies .
Now who has given you the right to describe peoples as democratic or undemocratic ?
In this context you also use the new term ' human security ' as a pretext for preventive wars .
Furthermore , both reports , especially the second one , promote the EU 's greater militarisation due to the new drive for Battle Groups and the creation of a permanent EU military force .
This is being made possible through the development of Eurocorps , permanent structured cooperation , and adapting the armed forces of Member States to the EU 's aggressive plans .
This follows in the footsteps of ΝΑΤΟ by escalating the EU budget 's contribution to weapons and military expenditure .
Cooperation between the EU and ΝΑΤΟ is being stepped up under the guise of military missions , supposedly non-military police and legal forces .
These are experts who in reality prepare and handle the EU 's military campaigns .
You vaunt the 17 military missions carried out and call for more .
The EU you are building is a union of war , aggression and imperialism .
For this reason , the people must go down the path of resistance , disobedience and insubordination .
( PL ) Mr President , we are talking today about a sphere of competence that has hitherto been reserved for sovereign European states .
Today the apparition of EU foreign and security policy is becoming a reality as never before , especially following the introduction of the new Lisbon Euro-Constitution .
As a Polish Member , I do not want and cannot agree to Brussels rather than Warsaw deciding on Polish foreign policy , while German generals at military HQ outside Berlin or Brussels take care of our security .
Nor do I want Polish soldiers with an EU flag on their uniforms to be acting on behalf of foreign interests in various places in Europe and the world .
Current trends and the now open structure of the single European state are unacceptable .
Of course , you can trick your own peoples by not even asking them what they think about the construction of a super-EU , but sooner or later this project will crumble to dust .
Mr President , today 's message should be that the CFSP should more than ever be based on common European values .
To the ever-increasing security challenges there is one convincing answer : solidarity and enhanced coordination of common foreign and security policies .
Those value-based objectives should be seen as taking priority over bilateral relations and Javier Solana was right in telling us that what really matters is political will .
As for energy security , I would like to call on the Commission and the Council to take serious account of Parliament 's position from last September on foreign energy security , which also offers some institutional improvements .
This report also calls on the Commission to concentrate all its efforts on successfully completing the Nabucco pipeline .
I think it is not a question of one or the other : we should build our own pipeline in practical terms and effectively .
Finally , it is high time to effectively address the new cyber-challenges , as the rapporteur , Mr Kuhne , mentioned .
I would like to use the term ' cyber-terrorism ' .
A year ago , one million computers from all over the world were mobilised to block government institutions and banks in Estonia .
I think the European Parliament too has to prepare a concise stand on how to respond to the threats of the newest technologies , which up to now seem to surpass the progress achieved by the Lisbon Strategy .
Mr President , I want to address a matter of principle , namely the neo-conservative tendencies of this House on the EU Foreign and Security Policy .
Seemingly some of us believe that the substance of any foreign policy is dependent on the nature of the political regime pursuing it ; therefore it looks as though our main objective has become the export of our political model .
Unfortunately , the European Union has neither the decision-making mechanisms nor the means to promote effectively an interventionist policy .
We must change this approach , adopting realism as a base of our external action .
This means : clearly defining the scope of our foreign policy in accordance with the common existential interests of European citizens ; balancing the scope with the resources , while acknowledging that this world contains actors that are different from us and do not always necessarily share our values ; learning to operate with them , and giving up narcissism to look for negotiations and cooperation with our opponents , and not only with our friends .
Certainly we should try to make as many as possible of our foreign interlocutors into our friends , but before doing that and while doing that I believe we have to learn to operate with those who are not like us .
I believe that we could be more appealing through our means , through our behaviour in promoting our goals rather than by our targets , thus eventually promoting our model in the world .

( PL ) Mr President , there are several aspects that we must consider while discussing the European Union 's common foreign policy today .
The reports by Mr Kuhne and Mr Saryusz-Wolski are really very good , but there are a few elements that are lacking .
I would like to point out that we should devote greater attention to explaining European foreign policy , including its defence aspect , to the public .
Our citizens , our public , are perfectly well aware of what comes from us , from the European Union - agricultural policy , policy on infrastructure - but they are never clear about European foreign and defence policy and what it is linked to .
Let us not forget that at its inception the European Union was constituted around problems other than this .
It is also important to consider the Treaty of Lisbon , which will , I trust , enter into force as soon as possible and be the foundation for new EU actions , and to ensure that one of its outcomes is a set of instruments that are as efficient as possible .
Many of the speakers here have dwelt mostly on military matters .
Certainly Battle Groups and everything related to the European defence identity are very important , but it is of no less importance to discuss the model of European diplomacy along the lines of how that diplomatic service is to operate .
It is important that the report emphasises that EU foreign and defence policy is intertwined with a variety of very important areas of life in the European Union .
It is important to emphasise that we are also introducing the ideas of a common energy policy and energy security as an element of our common European thought .
To conclude , it is important that we think of foreign and security policy as an extension of the area of security , stability and democracy .
In this context I note with great approval the strong accent placed on both the Balkans and Georgia .
( PL ) Mr President , the security of people living in Europe is one of the European Union 's most important tasks .
If we take a clear look at Community policy in recent years we see that , beyond political actions , we are militarily lightweight .
Some European countries , in pursuing their own ambitions , are trying to compete politically and militarily with NATO , of which they are members .
Concentrating on setting up common Battle Groups , particularly extended commands , rather than professionalising selected units in individual Member States is a mistake .
It is also a mistake to under-utilise existing NATO structures .
The Community 's strength ought to lie in strong national armies .
The European Union must resolve conflicts in Europe that are currently frozen , not only by means of declarations , but also through real political actions .
The recent problems in Georgia have been provoked in part by EU support for Kosovo .
( ES ) Mr President , the Saryusz-Wolski report , which we will adopt tomorrow , is a very complete report that covers practically all the regions of the world affected by the European Union 's foreign policy in a balanced way .
As I have only two minutes I am just going to mention some of the horizontal aspects that the report rightly includes .
Today foreign policy cannot be explained solely from a geographical point of view .
There are issues that have a global , horizontal aspect , and they are of such great importance that the main actors in the Union 's foreign policy should be involved in them .
I am referring first of all to the fight against terrorism and organised crime .
These are matters that the foreign and security policy should pay very particular attention to .
Another question of great importance is that of migration and the fight against illegal immigration .
We need to secure the cooperation of the countries of origin and transit countries , and the Union should be resolutely involved through its external action .
In short , if we want to build an area of security , freedom and justice in the European Union , the external dimension is fundamental , as the Saryusz-Wolski report says .
This is something that cannot only be the responsibility of the Home Affairs Ministers or of the Commissioner for Justice .
Another priority horizontal aspect is energy security .
Given the high level of external dependency of the Member States , we need to move towards a common foreign policy for the Union in the field of energy .
In addition , due to the clearly global nature of climate change , we need external action by the Union in order to find an effective response to this threat .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think it is essential to make progress on all these issues and for the Union 's foreign policy to form part of this .
They are issues that concern citizens , and citizens think that the European Union should help to promote them effectively , as State sovereignty is shared precisely in order to tackle the challenges that transcend the individual States and are therefore global challenges .
Therefore , by making progress in these areas , the European Union will be able to better justify its existence and thus increase its legitimacy as far as public opinion and citizens are concerned .
Mr President , I congratulate both rapporteurs , and I agree on the importance of the Lisbon Treaty assessments whilst evaluating the CFSP report .
If we were to have had this discussion in ten days ' time , after the decisive referendum - and my belief is that Ireland will say ' yes ' - the debate would have been even more concrete and optimistic .
Nowadays , when threats are on the rise and infiltrate from all sides , if the EU cannot speak with one voice , it is essential to speak at least in a coordinated and stronger manner .
I agree completely with Mr Solana 's assessment .
It will not be easy to start negotiations on the EU-Russia agreement .
After a delay of one and a half years there is a risk of losing a similar or even greater amount of time if we are not focused on the most fundamental issues .
This is why 27 countries have to coordinate their interests , concentrating on those which are common and important for all .
The alternative to the negotiations being delayed or failing is an amplification of Moscow 's bilateral talks with Rome or Vilnius , Berlin or Budapest , Paris or Sofia .
This is not an attractive option , especially for the new States .
The response of the Commission and the Council was timely - given the threat of climate change - calling this a central issue .
The European Parliament should continuously follow and scrutinise the way in which plans and measures are implemented to counter the threat .
( FI ) Mr President , this report stresses the importance of human and civil rights , which is good .
Trends in energy security are also seen as crucially important .
It also disapproves of the way that third parties , mainly Russia , use energy as a political tool and Member States sign bilateral energy agreements without EU coordination .
The EU really needs to take a look in the mirror .
Russia collaborates directly with EU Member States because the EU does not have any coherent or coordinated energy policy .
It makes you wonder whether the Member States even want one .
Russia 's role as an important EU energy partner , perhaps its most important , has to be recognised .
In energy cooperation between Russia and the EU we need to be aiming for a situation where both sides win .
I believe it is also possible to reach this win-win situation based on political will and far less prejudice .
An energy policy co-implemented by Russia and the EU should be based on cooperation , not confrontation .
At present some circles , including a few in the EU , are trying to hamper cooperation by being confrontational .
For a long time now Russia has wanted to be Europe 's equal partner .
May it be so .
We certainly know that Russia is not easy to negotiate with .
The EU 's Common Foreign and Security Policy needs to have greater influence in international politics .
I am very much in favour of Parliament putting pressure on the Council to promote the idea that the EU should have a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council .
As long as the EU does not have such a seat , it will be difficult to speak with one voice .
( SK ) The document concerned is in essence based on the European Security Strategy adopted by the Council in December 2003 , and on the May 2007 resolution on the common foreign and security policy .
I appreciate the work done by the rapporteur , Mr Saryusz-Wolski , the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , who has given us a comprehensive and high-quality text on which to vote .
I would like to stress several aspects of European foreign policy which cannot be implemented without strategic cooperation with our strongest ally , the United States .
This is adequately expressed by the EU-US Transatlantic Partnership Agreement , in which also includes the aspect of economic relations .
This issue is closely connected with military cooperation as well , not only with the US but also within the framework of NATO .
Of course it is necessary to clarify and say once and for all whether the security umbrella created by the radar system in Poland and the Czech Republic will serve and protect effectively common European interests , or whether it is just a unilateral initiative designed to protect against threats from Asia .
I have in mind the conduct of Iran in the Middle East region in particular .
We all know that Iran provides military and financial support to Syria and in particular to the terrorist groups operating in the region , groups that pose a constant threat to stability and peace through Hezbollah operations in southern Lebanon and Syria .
Iran makes no secret of its desire to achieve a hegemonic position and its military nuclear programme is meant to help it reach this goal .
However , I must ask whether it is possible to refer in the external policy document under discussion today to the Lisbon Treaty , which occurs on a number of occasions , since the Treaty is not yet in force as the ratification process has not yet been completed by all the Member States .
I have one more question : under what legal provision has the European Union sent the EULEX mission to Kosovo ?
Was it not , in fact , an ante legem act ?
I am sure that there is no UN resolution that would justify such a move .
Mr President , the world in which the EU is called upon to further its integration towards a truly common foreign policy gets more complex every day .
The prospect of economic recession , fuelled by the current financial crisis and increasing energy costs , the unsatisfactory status of transatlantic relations and the increasing assertiveness of Russia , which confront Europe more and more with old-style geopolitical challenges for which it is no longer equipped , are only a reflection of the current international environment .
In this context , against the background of increasing EU dependence on Russian supplies , energy tends to become the litmus test for success or failure in achieving the aim of a common EU foreign policy , because it makes all the difference whether Europe agrees to create a single energy market and consequently approaches suppliers , primarily Russia , with one voice , or continues to preserve the current national divides and give priority to bilateral preferential supply contracts destined to satisfy its increasing energy needs .
Today world politics is first and foremost about gas and oil .
Mr President , I support the development of CFSP , including ESDP , and the changes introduced by the Lisbon Treaty to these policy areas .
This is also the position of the Irish Government .
These changes will enable the EU to develop its capabilities for conflict prevention and crisis management , while ensuring that any new arrangements are fully consistent with Ireland 's traditional policy of military neutrality .
To the fellow travellers of Sinn Fein who are propagating misinformation on the Lisbon Treaty , I say to you that there is a triple lock system in Ireland on the deployment of troops : first of all , there must be a UN decision ; secondly , there must be a government decision ; and thirdly , it must be approved by Dáil Éireann , the national parliament .
This is not going to change after Lisbon .
The current UN-authorised EU mission in Chad , in which Ireland is playing a leading role , is a prime example of the EU 's activities in this area .
As someone who has recently visited Chad and the EU peacekeeping mission base in the east of this country , I am convinced that this mission will provide security for the provision of humanitarian relief to hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced persons , as well as protection for humanitarian personnel in the field .
This ESDP mission to Chad is the first time that a peacekeeping operation has been launched by the EU in almost perfect harmony with all stakeholders .
Other missions with Irish involvement have included police training in the Palestinian territories , monitoring of the peace process between rebels and government in Indonesia , and providing support to the police authorities in Bosnia .
There have been more than 20 such missions since 2003 .
There are increasing requests to the EU to provide assistance and support in these areas .
The key point regarding the totality of these initiatives is that their purpose is to make EU peacekeeping and crisis management activities more effective .
From a national perspective , we retain a veto on any developments with which we disagree , and we retain the sovereign right to decide on participation in any crisis management mission in accordance with our own legislative requirements .
This is one of the many reasons why Irish people should come out to vote ' yes ' on 12 June .
Before we move on , I should like to welcome all our visitors to the visitors ' gallery , but especially a group from my own constituency in Yorkshire and the Humber .

( FR ) Mr President , High Commissioner , I am addressing you directly to ask about the persecution suffered by Christians in Algeria .
What steps has the European Union taken with regard to the persecution of Christians in a State with which we have close links ?
Religious freedom is enshrined in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which also imposes an obligation on each State to ensure that these rights are respected .
Algeria is a member of the United Nations , but it is ignoring this fundamental right .
Christians are citizens in their own right ; they have the same right to practise their religion as any other religious community .
This is why I am imploring you , High Commissioner , to use all direct or indirect diplomatic channels to put an end to the persecution of Christians .
The credibility of the European Union is also at stake here .

( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Solana , I believe that the debate has shown very clearly that the European Union can truly be a political union only under certain conditions .
Firstly , only if the Treaty of Lisbon is ratified and , secondly , only if there is an actual European Security and Defence Policy worthy of the name , that is , when it develops into something better .
Then the European Union will have the opportunity to move from being a global payer towards becoming a global player .
There is no doubt that our initial efforts in Chad were not our finest hour , but it is a case study from which we as the European Union have been able to learn because , quite simply , the shortcomings became very obvious .
This showed once again that the European Security and Defence Policy requires compatible systems and new and rapid mechanisms for making troops available .
The time for debate is over ; now is the time for us to act !
( HU ) Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Kuhne on his excellent report .
He is completely right that 2008 will be a defining year for the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Not only because of the Lisbon Treaty , but also because Kosovo will be the greatest test of whether the EU will be ready to politicise Kosovo appropriately .
Unfortunately , there is still no agreement between the UN and the EU , and unfortunately we have not prepared on an intellectual level either , since we have not learned the lessons from our presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
With regard to the second report , I consider the anti-Russian slant of Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report to be unfortunate .
Russia may and must be criticised , but at the same time she is an unavoidable strategic partner , and the deepening of cooperation is a mutual interest .
It is not because the Member States of the EU conclude bilateral agreements that there is no common energy policy , but because , since there is no common energy policy , there is nothing to which the interests of the Member States can be adjusted or with which they can be aligned , so the criticism of Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report is unacceptable .
Thank you for your attention .


( SK ) Like others before me , I , too , want to express my thanks for the work done by Mr Saryusz-Wolski and Mr Kuhne , namely the balance they achieved between the social , legal and economic aspects in the report .
I expect that in the future it will be very important for us to give more weight to , and be better prepared for , dealings with our two biggest partners : the United States and Russia .
There is a new President in Russia .
Soon there will be a new administration in the United States .
Consequently , it will be quite right to focus precisely on these two countries in our common foreign policy .
Regarding the economic dimension , priority must be given to the need to ensure energy security in the European Union in particular .
I trust that progress will be made in the negotiations with the Russian Federation on this issue .
Since we are discussing our two partners here , let me say that it would help if we acted as an equal , and equally competent , partner in our relations with both parties , be it the United States or the Russian Federation , and if the policies were balanced .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to say that I welcome the references to the Lisbon Treaty .
By referring to it in the report we show that Parliament envisages its ratification and is fully behind it .
( CS ) Thank you , Mr President .
Mr Solana had not been seen among us for quite some time and I was worried about his health .
Now I can see that he is healthy and well , that following the Kosovo event he did not hang himself as Judas Iscariot did .
This means that I can ask him whether he knew that Hasim Thaci and his pals had been trafficking in human organs of Serbian captives .
Did he know this or not ?
( PL ) Mr President , both rapporteurs have gained my full recognition .
These are good documents .
I would , however , like to draw attention to several matters linked to foreign and defence policy .
I have in mind here our European potential in the following areas .
Demography - this potential is diminishing .
Economic potential is not bad , but financial crises threaten us .
Military potential - disunited , scattered - we can see how it is .
Energy potential , potential in access to water and to food .
We have spoken of other threats , to which I would like to add epidemiological threats and information security , for example .
Foreign policy today should , in my view , include union with countries that are close to us in terms of civilisation , cooperation with all who wish to cooperate and a firm position with regard to the rest .
( HU ) 88 years ago today , the European superpowers made some decisions on security policy , in the Treaty of Trianon that ended the First World War , that ignored the rights of national minorities , or only guaranteed them on paper .
The Treaty of Paris after the Second World War did not solve the problems either .
The question of security policy was reduced to a guarantee of the inviolability of borders .
Many of the borders created then have ceased to be , and Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia do not exist .
The question of minorities remains .
We Hungarians have ended up in eight countries , of which thus far only Slovenia has been able to resolve the rights of the Hungarian community in a reassuring way .
According to the report , progress must be made in harmony with European standards in the interests of ensuring real protection for the rights of minorities .
But what sort of European standards ?
It would be good to press for what we expect from the Western Balkans within the EU itself .
According to the Latin proverb , ' If you want peace , prepare for war . '
Today , we want a secure Europe .
The rights of minorities must be settled both within and outside the EU , using the instruments of regional and cultural autonomy that have been proven to work in the western half of Europe . Thank you .
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy . - Mr President , I would like to answer the two or three questions that have been addressed directly to me .
Firstly , that of Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra .
( ES ) Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra , I will say yes to the two questions that you have asked me , but allow me to say that first of all we are going to see if the Treaty is adopted .
Issues based on the ratification of the Treaty will have to wait and the agreements will probably have to come later .
( FR ) Mrs Záborská , we are looking into this matter .
Since Mrs Záborská is not here , I will save my answer until later .
At the Agency we are working very hard on interoperability : that is something that you asked about , and the answer is ' yes ' .
As regards the other questions , I answered them when I spoke earlier .
I have taken careful note of all the speeches and I hope that , as time goes by - as we approach the moment of truth - after the ratification of the Treaty , we will be able together to put into practice some of the ideas that have been suggested here .
Before they speak , I would again like to congratulate the two rapporteurs , as I said publicly before .
Finally , I would like to say that I agree completely with what Commissioner Verheugen said in his last speech , and I will not add any more to that .
Mr President , it is difficult to summarise this debate in a few words , but I am pleased with its content .
The need for collaboration between Parliament , the Council , the Commission and the Member States is the most important conclusion we can draw from this .
Secondly , the content enjoys fairly broad agreement .
Thirdly , we recognise that many extremely valuable things have already been accomplished .
Finally , we emphasise the need to redouble our efforts .
Commissioner , Vice-President Verheugen quite rightly reminded us of the immense contribution of Community policies , as managed by the European Commission .
I share his position , because integrated foreign policy would be incomplete without the results obtained with Community policies .
For the first time , I think that this is a debate in preparation for the appointment of the future ' double-hatted ' EU Foreign Minister .
Which brings me to ask the question : what shall we do without this creative tension ?
( FR ) ... in future , when there is only one institution .
I agree with the idea that we need a stronger foreign policy for the institutions in terms of content .
Energy security is the most frequently raised subject .
The country or geographical location which has been mentioned most often seems to be Afghanistan , as if it were a test for the European Union and for the entire international community .
There were several points of divergence .
Without these differences to fuel our debates , these might be a bit boring .
I therefore hope that future debates will be as lively and as rich as this one .
However , we have reached an agreement on the key principles , which looks very promising , and I hope that the Council , the High Representative and the Commission , with the very modest contribution of Parliament of course , are able in future to build a foreign policy for the Union which is even stronger , greater and more ambitious .

rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , this final chance to speak gives me the opportunity to do something I did not have time to do earlier on - to thank Commissioner Verheugen and Mr Solana for the excellent cooperation with their staff , who were available for discussions and from whom I learnt a great deal .
This had a very positive effect on the report .
I would also like to thank the all the committee members , particularly the committee chairman and rapporteur for the other report , Mr Saryusz-Wolski .
We occasionally sent notes to each other , like schoolboys , when we had overlapping issues in our reports , in order to achieve the same wording .
That also worked very well .
I would like to add three points :
First in English , since some of the speakers addressed the question of the Irish referendum .
On the legend of militarisation : my report contains a full list of arms control and disarmament proposals - a whole page of it .
Secondly , the Lisbon Treaty retains the right of every Member State to stay away from EU missions , especially military missions .
This right is not infringed by the Lisbon Treaty in any way .
It was very interesting to hear self-proclaimed advocates of NATO expressing their fear for the independence of neutral Ireland as part of the ESDP .
I think that was very interesting .



A final point , which Mr Pflüger mentioned , relates to the issue of parliamentary scrutiny : I do not know whether this was a deliberate misunderstanding , but the text that occurs in both Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report and my own does not preclude groups having access to confidential information .
The formulation is an open one .
Here in Parliament , we must first do our homework in order to develop some kind of negotiating position in relation to the Council .
What level of security clearance do we want to grant to how many Members ?
It may well be that we say that all groups are granted a certain level , and some groups another level , and so on .
We will have to develop that ourselves first , and neither of our proposals prevents the groups from participating in this .
I do not know whether this was a deliberate misunderstanding , or if the text was so unintelligible - I do not think it was - but we should first sit down together here in Parliament and develop our own negotiating position in relation to the Council .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 5 June 2008 .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
I would like to stress the significance of this report and to thank the rapporteur for having included all my suggestions in the final text .
In the context of the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and of the future competences of the European Parliament , it is necessary to sum-up the operations of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to draft its priority objectives for 2008 and 2009 .
The reinforcement of the European Neighbourhood Policy must be a major objective for 2008 .
Regarding the quality of rapport on the Black Sea Region Cooperation issues , I would like to stress the importance of its development in the near future .
If 2007 was the year of laying down EU policy regarding this space , 2008 must focus on the practical application of the Black Sea Synergy .
It is also very important to mobilise all efforts for the successful and fastest possible implementation of the Nabucco energy project , as well as resolve the conflicts in the region .
Finally , the West Balkan countries and their proximity to the EU must also be a priority in EU Foreign Policy .
Out of the series of issues that must be thoroughly monitored in this region , I would like to underline the need for effectively protecting the rights of minorities , including the rights of Romanian speakers .
in writing . - ( PL ) To begin with I would like to congratulate Mr Saryusz-Wolski on preparing a very good report .
I would like to highlight a few of the ideas we encounter when reading this report .
The most disturbing of these is the growing dependence of the EU on energy supplies from countries that are unstable and undemocratic .
We find an absolute lack of coordination in the signing of bilateral energy agreements by Member States that threaten the interests of and place question marks over EU strategic projects .
Actions of this type taken by certain Member States are significantly diluting the bargaining power of the European Union and its efforts to set up a common foreign policy .
I would like once again to emphasise the strategic significance of the Nabucco pipeline for the EU 's energy security , and to call on the European Commission and the Council to apply every effort to step up work on this project .
With reference to the two-day conference devoted to European Neighbourhood Policy that I am co-organising during the current Parliamentary session , I would like to stress the importance of actions aimed at reinforcing this policy .
The continuation of unresolved conflicts in countries covered by the ENP constitutes a serious challenge to EU security .
To sum up , I feel that reinforcing an eastern neighbourhood policy and putting an end to the provocation of conflicts beyond our eastern border , along with ensuring energy security , should be the EU 's foreign policy priority .
in writing . - The report reflects correctly our opinions on the evolution of the CFSP in the future .
The CFSP is a crucially important element in the EU 's foreign policy .
I would like to welcome the improvements brought by the Lisbon Treaty regarding external actions .
Its implementation would make the CFSP more efficient and more coherent .
The new posts created by the Treaty could give a greater visibility to the EU , but I believe it is essential to define the different roles in order to ensure that their different functions contribute to the coherence and efficiency of the CFSP .
If we want the EU to be an active force for international peace and stability , we must have all the necessary tools and instruments at our disposal ; but to achieve this , more political will from the Member States is needed .
The EU presence in the globe is widening , and we can find EU missions all over the world .
By helping to build security and stability in the wider world , the EU is also helping to make life safer for her own people .
This is the best way to defend its security and promote its values .
In my opinion these are steps in the right direction .
I support the report that has been presented .
In my view , it is a balanced and non-confrontational document .
An evaluation of the EU 's foreign policy is particularly necessary at present , especially in the context of the changes proposed in this area by the Lisbon Treaty .
I have no doubt that this Treaty , by buttressing the role of the High Representative , will enable a more far-sighted and long-term strategy to be practised in EU foreign policy .
The fact that the European Union as a whole is based on common values means that these same values must be reflected in its common foreign and security policy .
This is the only approach that will give the EU credibility in the international arena .
The CFSP demands , on the one hand , political unity among the Member States and , on the other hand , respect for the principles of solidarity , especially in the building of new EU political strategies .
I therefore share the regret and concern expressed in the report at the lack of progress in building a common European energy policy .
I am also unable to accept the fact that some Member States are concluding individual , bilateral agreements for energy supplies from Russia .
This is significantly weakening the bargaining position of the European Union as a whole and its efforts to build a common energy policy .
This is all the sadder inasmuch as not so very long ago these very States were criticising individual visa agreements with the United States , accusing Central European States that had concluded such agreements of weakening the common European visa policy .
Mr President , the European Union is becoming a global player in the world arena , and the best proof of this is the geography of Community involvement .
You only need to refer to the Council 's operational decisions of 2007 and early 2008 mentioned in Mr Kuhne 's report : the police mission in Afghanistan , the military operation in Chad , the reconfiguration of troops in Bosnia and the preparation for missions in Kosovo and Guinea-Bissau .
Unfortunately , the world geography of involvement is not going hand in hand with the elimination of deficiencies that have been evident for some time now , in the form of a lack of a civil peace corps in the EU , transport shortages and uneven commitment by individual countries .
In the light of information that has recently been received , a new dimension needs to be introduced into the debate on European security .
I am talking about the security of European institutions in Brussels , Luxembourg and Strasbourg .
The unmasking of terrorist groups that have chosen EU institutions as the target for their attacks means that the issue of security has ceased to be a theoretical one .
It forces us to re-evaluate our current principles .
We are aware that the European Parliament is by nature easily accessible , and it is difficult to find a golden mean between the openness of this institution and heightened security demands .
This is , however , becoming a necessity , which should be reflected in the budget for 2009 .
This matter is not as weighty as other problems covered by the report , but it does deserve attention .
in writing . - ( ET ) Ladies and gentlemen , effective foreign and security policy cannot be made by Member States individually .
A bilateral approach on energy and foreign policy issues has a destructive influence on how seriously we are taken .
It is unacceptable that the weight of the European Union in international relations has hitherto often been less than that of certain Member States .
The European Union must speak to the world 's large countries , especially the Russian Federation , with one voice which proceeds from the common interest of all 27 Member States .
Only then will we be viewed as an equal partner both in America and Asia .
I welcome the fact that Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report highlights strengthening European Neighbourhood Policy as the main objective for 2008 .
The European Neighbourhood Policy East Conference which is being held in the European Parliament today and tomorrow shows that we take our own objective seriously .
Action in the fields of democratising our neighbours and resolving conflict is urgently needed for European Union security .
We must help Moldova resolve the Transnistria conflict .
As the Chair of the Moldova delegation I must also note that the prospect of European Union membership is of great importance for both Moldova and Ukraine .
That possibility is the driving force behind economic reforms and democratisation .
It will of course take time to comply with the three Copenhagen criteria , although Moldova and Ukraine have shown themselves ready for European development .
The fourth Copenhagen criterion , namely the EU 's capacity to absorb , should not in any circumstances be a barrier to the accession of these two European countries to the European Union .
There is no question that enlargement must continue .
in writing . - ( FI ) My thanks go to the rapporteur for an excellent , comprehensive report .
I agree with him that it is important for the Union 's Common Foreign and Security Policy to focus over the years to come more steadily on the development of structures and procedures to enable the Union to react faster and more effectively to international crises .
Civil crisis management , peacekeeping and the protection of human rights are the cornerstones of the CFSP .
With the Treaty of Lisbon the EU 's external policy will have a new leading figure in the shape of the High Representative of the Union .
The changes the Treaty will bring with it will be an opportunity for shaping a more effective , more coherent foreign and security policy . The EU needs to speak and act more consistently in the world arenas .
I hope , however , that in its future annual reports Parliament will adopt a firmer position on a more coherent , stronger role for the EU in the United Nations .
The EU is an economic and political superpower .
Over the years the Union has seen its importance grow internationally and its main mission now must be to build a global organisation which respects people and the environment .
The EU must invest time and energy in the Mediterranean , Baltic and Black Sea regions to develop economic cooperation , political stability and democracy there .
More resources in the future will be needed to implement the Baltic Strategy , increase cohesion in the region and solve its environmental problems .
Support for , and closer integration with , the Black Sea region as part of the EU 's Neighbourhood Policy will be a means of increasing political stability both in the EU and more widely in the Black Sea area .
The Kuhne Report on the application of the European and PESA Security Strategy is well-structured , taking into account that it identifies real issues and offers possible solutions .
I think that this kind of operational " checklist ” approach will facilitate the monitoring of the progress .
In terms of content , I would like to make the following notes :
1 .
They should mention the European College of Security and Defence which plays an important role in the development of a common agreement of PESA by means of the training provided on a strategic level , especially in the context in which the chairperson of SEDE , von Wogau , sent a letter addressed to SG / HR Solana in which he showed support for the activity of ESDC .
2 .
The declaration regarding EU-NATO relations could have comprised a stronger message , in light of the Declaration of Bucharest adopted at the NATO summit .
3 .
They could have mentioned the importance of the strategic partnership between the EU and NATO .
The statement according to which " a stronger European Union will contribute to the common security ” might be combined with the principle of indivisibility of the allies ' security , which is thus extended upon the EU .
in writing . - The report of Mr Saryusz-Wolski reaffirms the European Union 's commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals , but this phrase in itself has become a little shallow , as it is being used lavishly in the EU development policy discourse , when very little progress is actually made and the MDGs are still beyond our reach .
Of all the Member States only Denmark , Luxembourg , the Netherlands and Sweden are contributing more than 0.7 % of their GDP to Official Development Assistance , although the 0.7 % target was adopted as early as October 24 , 1970 within the International Development Strategy for the Second United Nations Development Decade .
I am convinced that ensuring the credibility of the EU as a global player should be a significant part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Fulfilling the commitments that we have taken would be an excellent start .
The EU and its Member States must transform the verbose declarations reaffirming their commitments into harmonised and collectively effective action .
In my opinion this can only be achieved when pooling resources and establishing one single EU institution responsible for the accumulation , allocation and disbursement of the Official Development Assistance .
in writing . - ( FI ) With the Treaty of Lisbon the EU will become militarised , as the Common Foreign and Security Policy will incorporate an extra component in the shape of a common security and defence policy .
It will make it harder for non-aligned countries to retain their non-aligned status .
That will be the case when the Member States place themselves under an obligation to increase their military expenditure .
That will be the case when a new military hard core is created for the EU : permanent , structural cooperation .
That is to get under way during this French Presidency .
Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report is unfortunately in favour of the militarisation of the EU .
The report 's emphasis on energy security is also very aggressive from Poland 's very one-sided view .
EU-United States summit
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the next EU-United States summit .
President-in-Office of the Council . - Mr President , let me say something about the coming EU-US summit .
I shall use my own language , if you will permit me .
( SL ) Although the relationship between the European Union and the United States of America is essentially bilateral , the results of this relationship have global effects .
The transatlantic partnership ceased to be merely economic long ago .
The European Union and the United States cooperate closely both bilaterally and within international organisations on settling unresolved issues , including the most pressing regional issues , such as Afghanistan , the Middle East , and the Western Balkans .
As in all relationships , the European Union and the United States do , of course , sometimes have differences of opinion on certain issues , but we resolve them successfully with a constructive approach and mutual understanding .
The European Union and the United States are an important , the most important , system which has a considerable effect on international relations .
We have our differences but for the most part we work together as allies and friends .
We have many common values and a historical link , throughout the twentieth century in fact , and in the end we stood together , side by side , during the end of the Cold War and the expansion of Euro-Atlantic links .
Since the European Union finds it more difficult to reach consensus than the US , relations are , naturally , not straightforward .
However , consensus cannot always be reached within the United States either .
If we look at the reports from the election campaign we can see that consensus is difficult to reach even within the same party .
The European Union is united in diversity and , I should say , proud of it .
That is also the starting point of the Lisbon Treaty which , I hope , will enter into force at the beginning of next year .
During our Presidency of the European Council Slovenia has devoted a great deal of attention to strengthening transatlantic relations , in particular the strategic dimension to them .
I should point out that we have already held a large number of important meetings such as the troika meeting of EU and US foreign ministers , the meeting of political directors , and the EU-US ministerial troika meeting on justice and home affairs ; and in May a meeting between European and American legislators was also held in Ljubljana .
However , the most important event in connection with transatlantic relations will be the EU-US Summit which Slovenia will host in Brdo pri Kranju on 10 June .
I am pleased to be able to say that we expect the event to be well prepared , and we have already done a great deal of work .
At the summit we will also have an opportunity to explain the importance of the partnership between the European Union and the United States to the public at large and to demonstrate our common values , productive dialogue and compatible interests when dealing with urgent regional and global problems .
The summit will be divided into four parts , namely the meeting of the heads of state , the plenary session , and lunch , which will be followed by a press conference .
The heads of state will discuss the most pressing regional issues such as the Middle East , the Balkans , Central Asia and so forth , the Caucasus , and Iran , while other regional issues will be discussed at the plenary session and at lunch .
The talks will also touch upon other global issues , such as climate change , energy , the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation , development , health and security , and free trade and the free movement of persons .
At the plenary session , the summit will see the first presentation of the Progress Report of the Transatlantic Economic Council , which was established at the 2007 EU-US Summit in Washington and within which the European Parliament also plays an important role as an advisory body through the Transatlantic Legislators ' Dialogue .
The Progress Report of the Transatlantic Economic Council meeting held in Brussels on 13 May will be presented by the Council co-chairs , the Assistant to the US President for International Economic Affairs , Daniel Price , and the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry and Vice President of the European Commission , Günter Verheugen , who is present here today .
The press conference following the talks will be an important part of the summit since it will provide an opportunity to send a positive message to the European and world public about progress in transatlantic relations and planned joint projects .
The document to be adopted at the summit has been the subject of many months of talks between the European Union and the United States .
We are drawing up a declaration , to encompass the entire range of transatlantic cooperation .
Among other matters , it will touch upon regional issues , global security , transatlantic economic partnership , and global challenges , including climate change and energy .
Our intention and the Presidency 's objective is to draw up a brief and concise document with a firm political message , and I hope that we will succeed in doing so .
Even with regard to climate change , on which views differ , we have found , I hope , a compromise solution .
The proposed brief and factual text on climate change retains the most important objectives of the European Union and at the same time takes account of the views of the United States - I will not repeat matters which are well known to this Parliament .
The declaration is being adjusted in the Transatlantic Relations Working Party - COTRA - and the progress of the talks has also been presented at the Political and Security Committee on 20 May , at the meeting of the Permanent Representatives of the Member States to the European Union at COREPER on 21 May , and at the General Affairs and External Relations Council ( GAERC ) last week , on 26 May .
We are endeavouring to set a the date for the signing of the Air Safety Agreement - adjustment of which is now in its final stage - and we would like to be able to sign it at least by the end of our Presidency , that is to say by the end of June .
Furthermore , we support the earliest possible establishment of ' open skies ' , which will represent further liberalisation of transatlantic air transport and a new stage in relations between the European Union and the United States which will benefit people on both sides of the Atlantic .
The Slovenian Presidency is aware of the fact that some Member States have still not been included in the Visa Waiver Programme , which enables visa-free travel to the United States .
We have devoted a great deal of attention to this matter in all contacts with the United States and in our preparations for the summit .
The Slovenian Presidency has reached a compromise whereby the Member States of the European Union will enter into bilateral arrangements other than where matters for which the Commission is responsible are involved .
Ladies and gentlemen , I assure you that the Slovenian Presidency will invest a great deal of energy in its preparations for the summit and therefore I am convinced that we will be able to deem the summit in Slovenia a success .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is today an important , valued partner of many countries .
In an increasingly multipolar world , we have entered into strategic partnerships with our most important partners .
However , we have more in common with the United States than with all the European Union 's other strategic partners .
We share a major part of the responsibility for a fairer world , in which we all share in the prosperity and in which our security is solidly anchored politically , economically , socially , ecologically and also militarily .
This partnership is as ambitious as it is hard work .
It requires us Europeans to demonstrate more solidarity in the international arena , but it also requires a rethink on the part of our American friends , as it requires them to accept that the role of leadership in the world must be shared .
The situation calls for an openness that amounts to more than simplistic pro-European or pro-American , anti-European or anti-American reactions .
What we need is a broad awareness that there is not much that divides us , but a great deal more that connects us .
A range of important issues will be discussed at the EU-US Summit .
In the area of foreign policy , the discussion will focus on cooperation between the EU and the United States in the Western Balkans , especially Kosovo , and in the Middle East .
Also on the agenda is a discussion on how we will work together to tackle climate change .
This is a difficult topic on which the EU and the United States are still very far apart .
Nevertheless , the political debate in the United States has changed considerably , and it is moving in our direction .
Our European goal is to achieve an ambitious , substantial agreement for the period after 2012 within the framework of the global negotiation process under the umbrella of the United Nations .
It should be an agreement on which we have the world 's most important industrialised nation , the United States of America , on board .
Energy policy is also on the agenda .
We want to push ahead with cooperation in science and technology and at the same time , we need constructive , open dialogue with our traditional and potential energy suppliers .
It would be sensible for us to exchange experiences in a transatlantic context .
Our cooperation in the fight against international terrorism became a key joint concern on 11 September 2001 , if not before .
We want to improve the opportunities to exchange personal information for the purposes of tracing wanted persons .
However , this presupposes that we develop and observe joint principles for data protection .
It was inevitable that visa freedom would be a topic at this summit .
Last year , the reform of the US visa waiver programme opened the way to finding a solution .
The Member States and the Commission are working hand in hand on this - I am delighted to be able to say this - with the Commission concentrating on the Community competences .
I must state quite clearly that , politically , it is incomprehensible that we Europeans , who are united under the Schengen system , are treated differently when we enter our most important partner country .
Therefore , we will remind the President of the United States of the promise he made to lift the requirement for a visa .
Let me now turn to economic relations , which the President-in-Office has commented on .
The creation last year of the Transatlantic Economic Council , the TEC , brought into being a political instrument to drive forward transatlantic economic integration .
This economic growth is the heart of the global economy .
It is the centre of gravity for trade and investment worldwide and will remain so for many years to come .
Therefore , we are determined to use the TEC to find solutions to questions that have remained open for years - some of them for 10 , 15 or even 20 years - and which represent significant barriers to transatlantic trade .
The ' report card ' after the first year is good .
We successfully tackled the first , difficult questions .
Above all , we have managed to create a spirit of cooperation and mutual trust such as we have not known before .
I am glad that we can count on the full support of the European Parliament , which is involved in every phase of this cooperation .
We have good working relationships with all existing transatlantic dialogue partners and I am also thankful for the support of the Council , which will continue to be important in the future too .
There are a number of tangible results : we have moved forward as regards the product safety of imported goods ; we have gained acceptance of European financial reporting standards by the United States ; we have a common point of view on the promotion of an open environment for global investment , on which the summit will also issue a statement .
We are already cooperating more closely on proposed legislation and we want to pursue common European-US standards , so that we do not have to compete against each other with our standards on the world 's markets .
We are a significant step closer to mutual recognition of safety regulations for electric appliances , something we Europeans have been asking the Americans for for many years .
The Americans have reopened that particular file , something we did not expect to happen so soon .
We have started to coordinate our economic policy interests towards third countries and in the international context .
As yet there is no breakthrough with regard to the 100 % scanning of freight containers .
This is very worrying .
I would therefore ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to make good use of your contacts in Congress , because this was a decision by the US Congress , not the US Government , which is why my efforts to find a solution in talks with the US Government are not very promising .
Congress must act ; the Government cannot .
I hope that your contacts in Congress will help us here .
The Commission has presented two proposals in connection with the work of the Transatlantic Economic Council , relating to the import ban on American poultry .
We propose lifting this ban on poultry imports .
It is not legally or scientifically tenable .
I realise that the debate about this has sometimes been very emotional , obviously without full knowledge of the background and circumstances .
I would ask everyone who wants to say something about this topic to inform themselves fully first .
Besides , it is a question that was arbitrarily withdrawn from parliamentary debate for many years , as I have discovered .
We must not allow protectionism to put the case , nor should we take the arrogant position that our solutions are the only good ones for consumers and that the way other people do things is automatically bad .
It may well be the case that something different is not worse than what we do .
This has to be assessed on a case by case basis .
Just because something is different does not mean that it is not as good .
If we do not solve this problem , which is basically a very minor problem , but one that is deeply significant for the Americans , we will not have even the remotest chance - and I say this in all seriousness - of bringing the major agricultural policy topics we want to discuss with the Americans to the negotiating table .
For example , we will get nowhere with the requests we want to make of the Americans in the area of agriculture .
I am directing this remark to the European Agriculture Ministers , who thought it appropriate to say no to this initiative before they had even looked at it .
They have caused themselves great harm .
I have no illusions : all the issues that the Transatlantic Economic Council deals with are difficult and nothing will get done quickly .
However , with the necessary wisdom and farsightedness , all these issues can be resolved on both sides .
This instrument is too important , and too valuable , to squander .
Furthermore , in the light of the stalled Doha negotiations , its value cannot be underestimated even though we have every interest in seeing the world trade round through to a successful conclusion , with a result that is beneficial to all involved .
At the summit , we will achieve a speedy conclusion to negotiations on the second stage of the Air Transport Agreement , which will give the transatlantic economy an additional boost .
Ladies and gentlemen , overall , the way relations between the EU and the Unites States are developing is very pleasing .
Regardless of the opposing paths that inevitably occur , our relations are constructive and future-oriented .
We hope that this summit will send a further strong signal that we are partners who are committed to taking responsibility for the transatlantic region and resolving global issues , regardless of the different legislative periods and different terms of office applicable to the Administration , the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
I would be sincerely grateful if the European Parliament would continue to support and promote this process energetically .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - Mr President , a few days ago we were with the Transatlantic Legislators ' Dialogue in Ljubljana and we very much welcomed the Slovenian Presidency 's warm reception there .
The debates we had with our congressional colleagues showed just how broad an agenda has now developed between the US Congress and the European Parliament in this transatlantic framework : economic issues , which we heard the Commissioner talk about just now , political issues , which could also be economic , like climate change , but also difficult issues like Afghanistan and the broader security concept .
Therefore , we welcome this debate before the EU-US summit next week .
I have three short reflections to give to this debate .
Firstly , when you have such a broad agenda of so many different issues , which is of quite a different nature from that of ten years ago , we surely need to begin to build some form of common approach to a security dimension , a security strategy .
We had a debate just now on the European security strategy .
We need to begin to match that up with US security strategy in the longer term so that we can then approach these problems on a broader base together .
Secondly , there is a real absence of the legislators ' dialogue in this debate .
We are put to one side , as it were , in Ljubljana and then the summit meets in Ljubljana two weeks hence .
It looks rather like a 19th century organisation , because there is no real contact between the administrations ' and the legislators ' dialogues .
Surely , as this motion for a resolution indicates , we now need to plan for a transatlantic assembly where you can get the main legislators on both sides of the Atlantic to talk with each other and come to common initiatives together .
My last point is a personal reflection : as we have the EU , US and NATO all coming to deal with these issues together , perhaps it would be an idea at the NATO summit in Kehl , to be held in the spring of 2009 , for the EU-US summit to meet in the margins of the NATO summit to show that NATO , the EU and the US are handling these problems jointly .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I should like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their introductory speeches .
I share the conclusion of Commissioner Verheugen that the atmosphere is positive , better that it was a few years ago .
Of course , we expect even more improvement when a new government takes office early next year .
I believe that both candidates want change , want greater investment on the part of the United States in international cooperation and multilateral institutions .
That too offers prospects for even greater improvement in the relations between the European Union and the United States .
You will forgive me for having a preference for one of the two candidates , of course , and today it has become clear who those candidates will be .
There are a number of problems that do remain on the agenda , however .
I shall not discuss economic cooperation , as Commissioner Verheugen has already touched upon that point and we had an extensive debate on the issue a few weeks ago .
One point that I should like to raise once again , as I did in the previous debate , is the issue of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons .
It is time for a new initiative .
I believe that the United States should make a gesture , for example by signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty ; however , there are new opportunities regarding the conclusion of agreements on the multilateralisation of the nuclear fuel cycle .
I am happy with what has already been said by presidential candidate John McCain on the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from Europe , an indication that he is taking this agenda seriously .
The second point is the issue of the anti-missile defence system .
My colleague Mr Rouček will say more on the topic , which continues to be important to us , as we believe that this cannot be unilaterally regulated in the bilateral negotiations under way with a number of NATO member states .
It is a European problem ; it affects the security situation in Europe .
At the very least , it should have been discussed multilaterally within the competent European bodies .
I share the criticism regarding the lack of agreement thus far in relation to visas and the Visa Waiver Program .
We believe of course that all EU Member States , especially the states that form the Schengen area , should be fully incorporated into the programme .
Now that the Commission is able to enter into negotiations itself , I hope that it will make headway in this regard .
One further observation by way of conclusion : we continue to be dissatisfied with American responses to our complaints regarding the practices of the CIA in relation to extraordinary renditions and the continued existence of Guantánamo .
For once , putting an end to these continues to form an important item on the agenda of the joint consultation .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , it is important to have an open discussion forum and cooperation between the United States of America and the European Union .
Commissioner Verheugen also emphasised the importance of cooperation with Congress .
I too had an opportunity about a week ago to attend a meeting of the Delegation of the European Commission to the United States .
This sort of contact is important .
There , as obviously elsewhere , there are open discussions on difficult questions and each side certainly tries to promote the issues which relate to its own part of the world .
What is clearly evident from these talks is that when the United States tries to make a case for security issues , it is very often a case of economic and trade protectionism .
I agree totally with Mr Wiersma and I too regret that the EU Member States have not been treated fairly and equally when it comes to the matter of visas .
When the US administration changes , hopefully the EU might speak to the United States with one voice about this , and then the Member States might all be treated in exactly the same way .
Personally and finally , I would like to say that we here in Europe and everyone the world over have been following the first round of the battle for the White House .
In fact , it definitely gives an excellent picture of the US democratic machine .
The EU could do well to take a look in the mirror here .
We talk here about selections for top EU positions .
There is no open forum , let alone any very democratic process , while these posts are being handed out prior to elections .
Could you imagine the most important administrative and political posts being allocated in the United States before the elections , as goes on here in the EU ?
In other words , we definitely have a lesson to learn from the United States in many areas , at least in issues of democracy .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we want good relations between the United States of America and the European Union .
The prerequisite for this , however , is also that the European Union speaks with one voice .
Challenges and crises in the Western Balkans , in the South Caucasus region , in the Middle East and in Afghanistan , the fight against terrorism now taking place in the media and the food crisis that is now apparent , issues of energy security , climate change , economic recession as well as issues of transparency and regulation on the financial markets - on all these issues we need one another and we must work together .
However , we also want to reinforce the parliamentary dimension by involving the US Congress and the European Parliament .
One point that is supremely important to our citizens is - and I say this in full awareness as someone who considers himself transatlantic - the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison and all the other secret prisons in the world .
It is important that we explain to our American friends that the remaining prisoners must either be legitimately charged or else released and , if necessary , appropriately compensated .
We too can make a contribution , however , by accepting the Uighur prisoners into the European Union , thereby also helping to end this scandal as quickly as possible .
Another point that is important for the collective reputation of our common democratic values is that on the one hand we are in agreement that there is a terrorist threat , but that on the other hand we also have to highlight the fact that this debate is also taking place with constitutional funds .
This is precisely not the case with the current practice of lists of terrorist organisations both in the European Union as well as in the United States .
This issue must therefore also be put to the test as a matter of urgency .
I would once again highlight the fact that terrorism and organised crime have to be tackled on the basis of fundamental rights and common constitutional principles .
This also applies to the exchange of personal data between the United States and the European Union .
Another important point is ultimately the issue of climate change , because many aspects are affected , from food security via energy to water supplies .
This item therefore has to be given high priority at the summit .
Both partners should agree on a common approach to containing climate change .
It must be our aim to limit the increase in temperature to a maximum of two degrees with regard to pre-industrial values .
We are demanding that the industrialised countries fulfil their responsibility .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank President-in-Office Dimitrij Rupel and Commissioner Verheugen for their introduction to this debate .
In many ways what we see happening is a convergence of ideals and goals between the US and the European Union .
Too often we focus on that which divides us .
By geography we are divided by the Atlantic Ocean , but what unites us is what is within our hearts and minds , within our value systems and our beliefs as regards democratic control and the promoting of democratic institutions across the world .
We need to really focus on the core elements of what kind of a vision the US and the European Union can give to the world in the 21st century .
Obviously my colleagues have mentioned many of the challenges that face us , whether it be climate change , the development goals or whatever else .
But first and foremost , we must focus on bringing about peace and stability within regions and within areas .
That is why it is quite appropriate that the next summit between the EU and US will take place in Ljubljana , because in Ljubljana we can look to the west and we can see that there is stability and peace in the European Union .
We can look to the south-east and see potential fracture and potential danger in the Western Balkans .
We can look further east and see potential danger and potential fracture with what is happening in the Middle East .
That is why I think it is important that , when we do meet and discuss issues , while of course the agendas are going to be wide-ranging , by necessity they must focus on key and core elements .
Those key and core elements in my opinion should be based on : ensuring that the Quartet continues its work with regard to the Middle East peace process ; ensuring that the agreement in Doha of the parties in Lebanon with regard to the Lebanese situation is encouraged and supported ; guaranteeing that Kosovo and other areas within the Western Balkans are given the security guarantees that they require to develop their democracies into a stable and peaceful future .
But most important of all is for us to come together to give leadership to the rest of the world , in particular in the area of climate change , energy and food .
Because the most striking issue now facing so many countries around the world , not just developing countries but developed countries , is the price of food and the difficulties that will create .
Collectively the US and the EU can maintain a strong position , but can also give great leadership for the future .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , will you set out the specific points on which you disagree ?
The European Parliament is calling for Guantanamo to be closed and there have recently been revelations about prison ships , which quite possibly have called even at European harbours .
Will you say something about this to the Americans or will you back the demands of US citizens on the issue ?
Will you say something to them to stop them undermining the global agreement on climate change , to urge them to abandon their unilateral approach to biofuels and to make a slight compromise so as to tackle the present food crisis that is pushing up food prices ?
Mr Verheugen , since you have played a leading role in lifting the ban on chlorinated chicken , which has been in place in the EU since 1997 , let me tell you that all of us who disagree with you - and there are many of us - do so not through ignorance but because we consider protecting public health to be more important than commercial interests .
Twenty-one of the 27 Member States disagree with you , as do a unanimous European Parliament and the relevant parliamentary committee ; there are strong objections even within the Commission .
This is not something to be taken lightly , Mr Verheugen ; you must present some arguments .
( NL ) Mr President , the partnership between the European Union and the United States is a cornerstone of the EU 's external policies , as the joint resolution rightly states .
Such a partnership posits a number of self-evident agreements , such as the principle that we do not involve ourselves in the internal affairs of the other partner .
I am sorry to say that , in latter years and recently also , our American partners have not always kept to this agreement .
For example , the President and the State Department have repeatedly declared themselves openly in favour of Turkey 's accession to the European Union and have exerted pressure to this end .
Such behaviour is unacceptable .
This is like the European Council or the European Commission making efforts to achieve Mexico 's accession to or integration into the United States .
Just because Turkey is a NATO member state does not mean that the country should also be able to join the European Union .
NATO is important to the European Union , but it is not the same as the European Union .
These are two different affairs , and the summit next week is a good opportunity to remind our partners of this in a friendly , yet resolute manner .
( DE ) Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I believe that it is perfectly clear , and it has also been clearly stated in the various speeches , that the European Union and the United States of America can together contribute as nobody else can towards peace and freedom in the world on the basis of their values .
We do , however , know that we sometimes have different views .
If we also find American unilateralism very unpleasant at times , this unilateralism is also partly rooted in our own weakness .
That is why a better European policy in relation to the United States , inner strength and one voice in foreign and security policy are conditions for creating a genuine partnership .
With the Transatlantic Economic Council we now have an instrument for consolidating our common interests in a specific area .
For this reason it makes me very sad that things are already threatening to collapse on the chicken issue , that the President of the United States is having to make telephone calls on account of the chicken issue and that we are not showing a certain willingness to compromise on this issue either .
We have to consider whether or not a lot of things have been exaggerated here and we are therefore in a position to create a basis for the development of a transatlantic market , enabling us to determine our common interests in the world , implement standards and - as Mr Elles has rightly said - include the Parliaments in this .
Commissioner Verheugen has already mentioned that legislation in many sectors is already affected , which is why the Parliaments on both sides have to be included pre-emptively in order to bring the situation under control and implement these standards together in the world .
If we were to succeed in this and if we are able to maintain this momentum beyond this year 's elections in the United States and next year 's elections in the European Union , we will perhaps have created the basis for understanding that climate change , organised crime , migration and much else can only be tackled together in the interests of a better world .
This is why we should be working more closely together with our American friends .

( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , in my speech I will mention one aspect of the relations between the European Union and the United States , and that is the US anti-missile shield system .
In my home country , the Czech Republic , where a radar base is to be installed as part of this shield system , two thirds of citizens permanently oppose this plan .
The Czech people are believe that the anti-missile shield does not concern only bilateral relations between the US and the Czech Republic or Poland but that the questions of the anti-missile shield and non-proliferation of weapons affect the security of Europe as a whole .
I thus want to call on the Council once again to create , finally , a platform for the participation of all EU Member States in the debate on this issue .
I also want to use this opportunity to call on the United States not to sign , at present , the treaties on the installation of their anti-missile shield elements in Europe .
America and Europe are facing a number of far more pressing problems : the fight against terrorism , security of energy supply , global warming , Afghanistan and many others .
Let us therefore work together ( and I mean together , as partners ) to find solutions to these problems .
We can leave until later those issues that are not urgent and that currently divide us instead of uniting us .
Mr President , Commissioner Verheugen has just made an appeal to the European Parliament to use its contacts with Congress on the issue of the 100 % screening of containers .
Very well , I think we are happy to oblige ; but then , in return , I think this Parliament would like to be more closely involved in matters such as , for example , the framework for transatlantic data protection , because for the last year and a half that has been treated by civil servants behind closed doors , as if it were a mere technical matter rather than one relating to our civil liberties and our fundamental rights .
This is not a matter for diplomats .
It is time that the Commission and the Council brought this to the European Parliament .
Another matter concerns something that was announced the other day by the United States authorities - the electronic travel authorisation scheme .
I would like to hear whether the Council and the Commission intend to raise this at the summit with the US .
I get the impression that , by now , we have a patchwork of security measures that affect travellers - the electronic travel authorisation , PNR , API , biometric passports , fingerprints , entry-exit systems , automatic targeting system , visa , visa waiver - and the EU is just blindly copying all this .
It is time that , instead , we started talking about a coherent , effective and proportional framework of security measures .
In this context , I would like to know whether the Commission and the Council intend to raise the following issues with the US authorities .
They have announced that - I believe as of August - they will require air and vessel carriers to collect 10 fingerprints and facial scans of all travellers and to submit this information to the Department of Homeland Security within 24 hours .
I will submit a parliamentary question on this , and I would like to know whether the Council and the Commission agree with me that carriers should not be carrying out law enforcement and security tasks , and whether they intend to intervene .
Finally , with regard to the visa waiver , I would like to highlight a specific issue .
We have asked this a number of times and never got an answer : do you intend to raise the issue of the unacceptable travel ban to the United States for HIV patients ?
( PL ) Mr President , not long ago the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which it called on the United States to abolish the visa requirement for citizens of all EU Member States and to respect the principles of reciprocity .
Citizens of the United States may travel freely to all EU countries , but the only people who do not have to apply for US visas are citizens of a few of the richest countries of the European Union .
This shows an imbalance in the treatment of certain fully-fledged EU Member States .
Unfortunately , this issue has not received adequate attention to date from EU institutions that often display excessive zeal in other matters .
We are witnessing an odd situation in which - by way of an example - Polish citizens are still being treated as potential economic migrants , even though it is ages since their goal was the United States .
They can , after all , work in EU countries that have opened up their labour markets to them .
There are no economic and certainly no political reasons why they should not travel without visas to the United States .
We must hope that at the next EU-US Summit the EU countries will table this problem in a resolute manner and finally resolve it .
( CS ) Mr President , given that Commissioner Verheugen was emphatically talking about prosperity , I expect the summit to look , first and foremost , for a way to curb the rising food prices .
I expect a politically correct response to the fact that tens of millions of people will die from hunger this year , and a further hundred million will slide deeper into poverty .
At the same time , milk in Europe is being poured down the drains right now , and rapeseed and sugar cane , now blooming in the fields , will be poured into vehicles ' fuel tanks .
High subsidies and import tariffs make it more profitable to grow fuel rather than grain , although it is well known that the price of wheat would immediately fall by 10 % and the price of corn by as much as 20 % if the countries declared a moratorium on biofuels .
Mr President , I believe that at the meeting in Ljubljana in a week 's time it will become quite clear whether the European Union and the United States are going to face up to their global responsibilities or are just going to continue to talk about them in a populist manner .
Given that they are facing the ( literally ) deadly results of the existing agricultural policies , they should abolish , as quickly as possible , the nonsensical agricultural subsidies , quotas and customs tariffs , and stop promoting biofuels .
( PL ) Mr President , we are talking to the European Union 's most important partner ; we have differences of opinion on many points , but the fact is that we are closer to the United States than we are to any other overseas country .
At the same time , however , in global terms our approach to several key matters affecting our entire planet differs .
The European Union has made the battle against global warming a banner for its activities - these are the preferences of all Presidencies , past and future .
The United States agrees that above all it is human activities that are leading to changes in climate , but it does not want to take upon itself the burden of combating climate change .
On the contrary , we , the European Union , have adopted a very fierce programme to limit emissions .
This will be a programme of exceptional harshness for our economy .
We have decided to do this because we want others to join us .
This is our aim , because we cannot save the planet by ourselves .
The United States is pretty much the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world .
Persuading this largest emitter to take on common obligations may lead to a global understanding in Poznań and Copenhagen , and it is only when we succeed in reaching such an understanding that our programme to limit emissions will not have been squandered .
I therefore think that discussion with the United States on this subject and the presentation of our projects , and persuading them to act jointly with us in the international arena during the next climate convention sessions , is one of the most important , perhaps the single most important point for the European Union today .
( PT ) The last EU-United States summit in the Bush era will take place on 10 June .
That era has been forever tainted by the illegal invasion of Iraq and the ignominy of Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo and the secret prisons .
We will breathe a sigh of relief after eight years of going backwards .
Eight wasted years in terms of what could have been an effective fight against terrorism compatible with the values of democracy and human rights .
Wasted years in terms of the quest for peace in the Middle East , wasted in terms of the fight against organised crime and in terms of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation .
Yet we know that Barack Obama will be the Democratic Party candidate and that hope is returning .
Obama has pledged his support for strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has even upheld the objective of complete nuclear disarmament .
This has already had a knock-on effect on his Republican opponent , Senator McCain , who has aligned his position with Obama 's and who has added that he supports the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons from Europe .
This proves that there is a critical mass in the United States that is ready for a change of strategy .
Europe must approach the new Administration as early as possible with regard to drawing up joint strategies for the 2010 NPT Review Conference , and for all frameworks in which global security and , especially , non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are at stake , including negotiations with Iran .
With this in mind , contacts between Members of the European Parliament and of the US Congress are of the utmost importance and should be stepped up right away .
Mr President , the US leadership is no longer enough to combat today 's threats and to prevent new ones in the future .
It is , however , still indispensable .
We are confident that President Obama - and I hope it is him - will be up to the challenge and that Europe will be able to use every opportunity to contribute towards a lasting strengthening of the multilateral system .
( PL ) Mr President , problems are increasing globally .
One example is the deteriorating economic situation .
A second is political utilisation of access to raw materials and the rise in their prices , including the rise in food prices .
A third is terrorism .
A fourth is local armed conflicts .
No single State has the power to solve these problems , so dialogue and cooperation are necessary between the EU and the United States .
There is another side to this coin , however , and that is economic and political rivalry between the European Union and the United States .
Therefore , in the most important matters , what is needed is appropriate arrangements to prevent this rivalry from being divisive .
Arrangements are needed particularly in economic matters .
The world should not be hostage to speculative capital and raw material monopolies .
Europe must not stand with Al Gore as a proponent of the idea of global warming at the cost of its own businesses .
In view of the forthcoming change of President in the United States , Europe should make its own political priorities and the proposals it has for their resolution very clear .
( BG ) Being a representative of a new EU Member State and a member of the Delegation for relations with the United States of America , I would like to speak about the important role of the Transatlantic Legislators ' Dialogue which covered the meeting held in Ljubljana only a few days ago .
I would like to express my gratitude for the topics included on the agenda because they clearly showed that the challenges facing some new EU Member States were very much on the agenda of the European Union and its institutions , giving us a sense of security and protection of key interests .
However , what I have in mind , first and foremost , is the issue related to the widely publicized security measures .
They include the visa arrangements , as well as the requirements for 100-percent cargo scanning .
On the one hand , these measures affect the free movement of the citizens of my country and primarily the opportunities for young people to have the same rights and chance which people of their age enjoy in other countries ; on the other hand , they generate economic problems for countries like Bulgaria , which have relatively small ports and will have to shoulder the heavy financial burden of providing the new screening equipment .
The measures will make these ports give up the handling of freight that will be channelled to larger port facilities .
This will definitely impair the economic interests of regions like the one I come from , i.e. the City of Varna , and the other Black Sea regions .
During the meetings held to discuss visa issues , I informed our U.S. colleagues from the U.S. Congress that the situation in Bulgaria was fundamentally different from what it used to be 10 or 15 years ago , when young people in large numbers went to the United States and , furthermore , rejection rates of visa applications were reduced .
This is the reason for the beginning of a new dialogue between the two countries .
Still , I do believe that Bulgaria needs to remain loyal to the common EU policy and to insist on the application of measures to protect all citizens of the European Union on the basis of reciprocity .
At the same time , our U.S. colleagues should understand that we all face common security problems which we have to resolve by working together rather than by putting obstacles to one another .
Therefore I support the resolution and the upcoming meeting .
( DE ) Mr President , a fundamentally positive relationship with the United States does not preclude differences in interests and opinions .
I believe that a partnership on equal terms is possible only on such a basis .
Only in this way can we also convincingly counteract anti-Americanism .
For this reason we in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are in favour of a direct dialogue on security policy with the United States on those issues in which the European Union has jurisdiction .
I would put forward two examples of this : the credibility of Western values when combating terrorism and the subject of stabilisation and reconstruction .
For precisely these reasons we are against the EU 's open or hidden links to the US National Security Strategy , as we see them in one of the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats to the report on security strategy , on which we shall be voting tomorrow , because it is perfectly clear that no President of the United States will ever accept that a third party , whether or not it is the EU , becomes a cosignatory to this National Security Strategy .
Why should we therefore tie ourselves to this same thing with a blank cheque ?
This is not equal terms and we are therefore against positions such as these .

( BG ) Mr. President , I would like to voice my support for the proposed joint resolution and to touch upon two issues like in the course of the legislators ' dialogue in Ljubljana : climate changes and energy , where both parties , i.e. the United States and Europe , should cooperate to a greater extent .
I hope that more opportunities will emerge to this effect in the wake of the U.S. presidential elections .
I particularly rely on the legislative activities at the U.S. Congress enabling the Copenhagen Conference to achieve global solutions .
Otherwise , countries like Bulgaria would be seriously affected by the loss of competitiveness of their products and exports if we were the only ones to implement the European Commission 's proposals on the climate change .
As far as the energy sector is concerned , our cooperation should not be confined only to clean technologies and the related fund but it should also cover nuclear energy that is apparently increasing its importance in the world , especially in countries like China and India .
We can be partners in this field only if the European Union could incorporate nuclear energy issues more openly in its policies .
Mr President , I would like to focus on three points .
Firstly , I agree with the emphasis of the Commissioner : let us follow up on the transatlantic Economic Council and the work that we can do there .
We need to show that we can take certain issues very seriously and can make the changes necessary to bring about the lifting of any unfortunate barriers , which are basic harbours for national protection .
This includes poultry , and it is sad to hear a reflection in the House that we should not have that ban lifted .
Secondly , we need to promote the positive agenda as well as challenge each other over the difficult issues such as climate change .
Finance is a very positive story to tell , and I hope that insurance will be added to the list of progress that has been made so far in this area .
Finally , the recent transatlantic dialogue in Ljubljana just got better .
More was discussed and more was agreed , and like my colleagues I can agree we need to raise this now to the agreed level of the 1997 Houston Joint Declaration .
Mr President , I wish to mention a few issues that I hope will be on the agenda of the summit on 10 June .
First , concerning Kosovo , it is obvious that it is in no one 's interest to have a new failed state in the Balkans , and therefore Romania has been participating for years in the efforts to stabilise the region .
Our concerns deal mainly with organised crime , prostitution and trafficking in human beings , drugs and weapons , and I believe the new Kosovar authorities must increase their efforts to control these practices .
I also think it is very important to monitor closely how local culture is preserved , especially Orthodox monasteries in the area .
Another issue I would like to raise concerns visas for all European citizens travelling to the United States .
I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen and Minister Rupel for raising this issue .
As you have seen here , there is very strong solidarity , irrespective of our political colour .
I must say that I was very surprised that during the meeting in Ljubljana our colleagues from the Congress put all the responsibility for this issue on the Department of State while , at the same time , President Bush used to say that it is the full responsibility of the Congress .
I hope you will finally find an answer during this summit in Ljubljana .
Finally , I should like to raise the issue of the price of food and poverty .

( SK ) Ladies and gentlemen , when the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection visited Washington in July 2007 , I became aware of the importance of cooperation between the United States and the European Union .
I believe that common EU and US policies in the areas of customs tariffs , intellectual property , mutual recognition , mutual understanding and harmonisation of standards can lead to the creation of a new transatlantic trade area to the benefit of both entrepreneurs and consumers , on both sides of the Atlantic .
Since the toys directive is being debated in Parliament at present , it would be very useful to find a common policy in regard to toy safety as well .
I am sure that Commissioner Verheugen , who represents the European Union in the transatlantic dialogue , can achieve a great deal in this matter .
Ladies and gentlemen , I hope that as a result of the forthcoming EU-US Summit the US visa-waiver programme will be extended to all EU citizens , including my home country , Slovakia .

( RO ) Mister President , I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for having introduced on the agenda of the EU-USA summit the visa issue that my country 's citizens are concerned with , and I represent them here in the European Parliament .
Furthermore , I insist that the USA join the European Union 's efforts in responding to the challenges generated by climate change ; otherwise , all European companies will be disadvantaged in terms of competition with the USA .
President-in-Office . - ( SL ) Allow me to answer the three questions which I consider to be most important .
Firstly , with regard to the question by Mr Rouček concerning the anti-missile shield .
The question which Mr Rouček asks in some way goes beyond a European Union issue , since it concerns agreements between two individual European countries and the United States of America , and two countries in particular , the Czech Republic and Poland , which are concluding bilateral agreements with the United States .
I personally would like these matters to be discussed within NATO or within the European Union , but at present that is not possible .
As I said , it is a bilateral matter which , of course , falls within the competence of the countries that are concluding these agreements .
As regards the Visa Waiver Programme , which has been the subject of a great deal of criticism and which has been discussed many times in this House , I would like to say the following : with regard to extending this programme , the Visa Waiver Programme , we hope that , in accordance with the agreement on a twin-track approach - the approach adopted at the EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Meeting - progress will soon be made .
To date it has been agreed that the United States will negotiate with the individual Member States on matters which fall within national competence and with the Commission on matters which fall within the European Union 's competence .
This I said earlier in my opening speech .
Therefore , we expect the Visa Waiver Programme to be extended to include more Member States of the European Union by the end of 2008 .
At present eleven countries are still not covered by the programme .
I would like to say a few words on climate change , Mr President , if I may .
The question was whether we have done enough on this issue or problem .
I am pleased that two important meetings on climate change and energy have been held during our Presidency , firstly the ' High Level Dialogue on Climate Change , Clean Energy and Sustainable Development ' and secondly the ' Strategic Energy Review ' .
Nevertheless , we would like the United States to show greater commitment in this field , and we in the European Union will try to persuade our American friends of the importance of acting globally and in agreement between the Europeans and Americans .
At present there are considerable differences between us .
I should also say that the European Union is firmly of the view that the issue of combating climate change must be dealt with within the framework of the United Nations .
That much I can contribute to the discussion for my part .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to address two issues briefly .
First of all , cooperation on security issues , which Mrs in ' t Veld has outlined very succinctly and which concerns how we find the right balance between the security requirements of our American friends and the demand that we ourselves are making on individual freedom and the individual rights of our citizens .
I should like to say quite clearly to you , Mrs in ' t Veld , that the Commission fully shares your concerns and I shall , of course , be informing the relevant colleague of the criticism you have expressed on the lack of transparency in the process and asking him to ensure greater transparency .
We shall be talking to the Americans before we can accept anything regarding the principles that must lead us to cooperate on these issues .
If there is no understanding on these principles , there can hardly be any understanding on individual issues .
This is , of course , one of the subjects to be addressed at next week 's meeting in Ljubljana .
It gives me no pleasure to say anything more here about poultry , but the subject has been addressed by several speakers here .
It is always good to know what we are actually talking about .
It is therefore also important to know that we are not talking about a food safety issue here .
For many years now the competent European Food Safety Authority has been explaining that there is not the slightest risk to consumer health from imported American poultry .
We are not talking about a veterinary problem ; we are talking about an issue of pure trade policy , which must be dealt with from the point of view : what are our interests and how do we best defend our interests ?
I think I have said what I needed to say to you .
Nor are there any differing opinions in the Commission .
The Commission has from the outset been explaining - as I must say - how not to allow this somewhat bizarre dispute to become a burden and how to rid ourselves of the problem .
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
As Vice-president of the ENVI Committee , I encourage the EU representatives participating in the meeting with the officials of the United States to analyse solutions concerning the issue of climate change .
Climate change is a global challenge for which we should prepare a global response .
Europe is taking steps in this regard .
The same example is expected from our neighbours across the ocean .
I am glad that the Unites States will join the efforts of the international community , after 2012 , following the expiration of the Kyoto Protocol .
I appreciate as well that , in the end , the US President has admitted that we need legislation with a view to reducing the level of greenhouse gas emissions .
I encourage EU representatives to discuss a real reduction percentage for actually putting an end to global warming .
We cannot accept that we need legislation in this regard , and when we reach the figures , we turn back .
At the same time , future debates regarding the cooperation framework on climate change must be based upon real studies on renewable energy sources .
I am mainly referring to first generation biofuels .
It is necessary to maintain a low percentage of their use and a low grants level .
In this way , we will protect biodiversity and avoid the price increase of food products generated by the reduction of land for agricultural activity .
in writing . - ( HU ) The EU-USA summit that will take place in a few days ' time is a good opportunity for us to examine the development of transatlantic relations in the most important areas .
We feel that cooperation on energy policy must assume an important role on the agenda .
Security of energy supply continues to be the primary objective on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean .
It is common knowledge that most stocks are in countries that do not always meet the requirements of democracy .
It is for precisely this reason that joint action and continued efforts are needed in the interests of promoting human rights and constitutionality .
It is important for us to emphasise that spreading the principles of democracy will also mean greater security of energy supply .
In addition to the above , future cooperation must focus on the fight against climate change with even more emphasis .
It is a very welcome development that the United States have committed to creating the basis for the post-Kyoto regime .
The Member States of the European Union and the United States must play a leading role , in the interests of having the most developed countries agree on the most important cornerstones of the international treaty before the end of the year .
The package of measures relating to reducing emissions that was recently introduced into American legislation is the latest sign that Washington wants to assume an active role in the fight against climate change .
Oil prices , which are bombarding levels that were previously unimaginable , draw our attention to the importance of joint international action in the area of energy policy .
We are convinced that it is unavoidable for the United States and Europe to take responsibility in this area .
in writing . - EU-US relations in many issues have been through substantial changes over the last years and are moving into a phase of consolidation for many items of cooperation .
The recent case of the negotiations on lifting visa restrictions for travellers from the EU is an excellent example - in spite of the positive outcome - showing why , in order to ensure successful talks between the US and the EU , we ought to avoid mere bilateral agreements which actually undermine the negotiating powers of the EU as a whole .
Having a package agreement encompassing the 27 Member States , based on the distribution of competences between the Union and the Member States , was indeed crucial in order to support the EU visa common policy .
It is essential to ensure that , where Community competences apply , we secure EU-wide deals with our strategic partners such as the United States .
In my opinion , it is in the interest of both partners .
It is indeed the only way to ensure that the Visa Waiver Programme brings full reciprocal visa free travel and equal treatment for all our citizens as regards the status of their passports , just as for US citizens .
in writing . - It is the moment to stress with all clarity and responsibility that the EU-US partnership is not only a cornerstone of the credible and efficient EU foreign actions but that only close cooperation and coordination between both partners would enable them to play key roles in the globalising world and to be guarantors of stability and democracy .
The European Union has no other partner in the world with whom to share the basic values of freedom , the rule of law and defence of human rights .
It is high time to fully restore normal cooperation and mutual trust after the damage that has followed the Iraqi invasion .
The latter has dramatically split the EU itself .
Therefore , I strongly call on both partners to complete without delays the work of the Transatlantic Economic Council .
Also a joint approach to the problems of climate change will substantially enhance the chances of solving these problems .
The same applies for Iran .
Both the USA and EU need to agree on a common strategy on Iran to efficiently stop preparations to develop nuclear weapons there .
Finally , we need a stronger redefined EU-NATO partnership which will also improve our cooperation in Afghanistan .
in writing . - ( FI ) Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to raise two issues that the EU needs to focus attention on at the summit .
Global challenges mean that the West above all has to show consistency and a sense of responsibility .
Firstly , the Union should have a constructive debate on America 's role in climate policy .
The world has one and a half years to change course before Copenhagen .
On the one hand , we have to encourage the United States to make essential plans for legislation on climate .
We need to stress that the solution to the problem of global climate change is a worldwide low-carbon economy .
This means that the carbon market mechanisms of different countries should be made compatible and in the course of time integrated with one another .
America 's regional emissions trading systems inspire hope .
On the other hand , we need to recognise that our partner in the fight against climate change is better than its reputation .
The EU should look for guidance from the United States and acknowledge its fruitful endeavours to develop clean technology .
The Union has some way to go here .
The United States is showing the way ahead by proposing to establish an international fund for environmentally friendly technology .
Cooperation between the EU and the United States will also be very important in order to bring in measures to adapt to climate change .
Secondly , the summit should highlight the basic values to which we are jointly committed : democracy , human rights and the rule of law .
We have to venture to ask how our value base is implemented in the policies of the Western world .
Do world leader 's actions look good in the light of day , for example , in the fight against terrorism ?
Because terrorism is a threat the EU and the United States share , the means of countering it needs to stand up to scrutiny .
Sometimes global political rhetoric and the everyday world seem to forget the fact that our value base does not place an obligation on others in the first place , but on ourselves , whether we are talking about the Middle East , the Western Balkans , or Africa .
in writing . - The forthcoming EU-US summit will give both transatlantic partners a chance to find common ground on issues relevant to both sides of the Atlantic .
Our continents share a common civilisation and a past .
We have to ensure that the knot of this relationship is as strong as possible so we can achieve the goals that are not only important for both sides but are global necessities .
The growing and extreme need for energy by emerging economies , rising food prices , and conflicts around the world are just some of the issues that the EU-US partnership has to work on together for peace , sustainability , and to facilitate human dignity around the globe .
One of the success stories of this relationship is NATO , an organisation we should all support and strengthen as it has secured peace in Europe and developed deeper ties between the EU and the US .
One-minute speeches on matters of political importance
The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance .
( EL ) Mr President , there has recently been a growing clamour within the EU for the expansion of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , above all to meet Europe 's energy demands .
The problem is the unchecked rise in the price of oil , the increasing demand from a number of countries with rapidly growing economies , regional disturbances in oil-producing countries , as well as the fact that renewable sources of energy or natural gas will cover a mere fraction of Europe 's energy needs .
As a result , the construction of nuclear plants is being tabled for discussion .
Many questions worry European citizens .
Can the safe operation of nuclear power plants be guaranteed ?
Do appropriate early warning systems exist to guarantee sufficient notice in the event of an operational problem ?
Finally , how safe is the management of nuclear waste ?
For all these reasons , I believe that on the initiative of the European Parliament and with the collaboration of the Commission , a dialogue could usefully be conducted leading to clear , unambiguous conclusions for European citizens .
I call on the French Presidency to make this issue a real priority in its agenda .
( BG ) Mr. President , Dear colleagues , I would like to draw your attention to an issues that makes us responsible for the future of the European Union and the world at large .
This is the trafficking in children .
In the 21st century , the age of high technologies and progress , this problems persists and it is too inhumane and brutal to be ignored or confused with other problems .
The trafficking in children does exist .
It is an encroachment not only against human rights ; it is an encroachment against the future , as well .
The life of any child is a blessing and its destruction is a crime against mankind .
The trafficking in children has atrocious consequences .
It is called " modern slavery ” .
What follows is physical and mental mistreatment , sexual exploitation , homicide .
What we need is to join our efforts and cooperate in a common policy to reduce and minimize its existence .
The European Commission should set up a separate programme and an action plan within the framework of the strategy for children and to undertake the measures needed for the establishment of common structures and policy .

( RO ) Mister President , dear colleagues , European dependence on hydrofuels import has increased , oil prices have reached an alarming level and the European Union is increasingly vulnerable to OPEC countries and Russia .
There is a need to approach the foreign relations in the energy field with joint efforts .
The bilateral agreements between the Member States and third countries must reinforce the common European approach and not weaken it .
The agreements signed by Italy , Hungary and Bulgaria with Russia in terms of building the South STREAM , a pipeline designed to avoid a Member State , like Romania , without any economic reasons , seriously affects the cohesion of European energy policy and represents political strategies that must be avoided among Member States .
I was expecting a firmer position by the European Commission in condemning this situation .
With regard to the legislation on energy security that is to be adopted in the second half of this year , I believe we should show an ambition level comparable to the one in the case of the legislation " Energy - Climate changes ” .
The speaking with one voice principle must become functional and the Commission should propose a mechanism regarding agreements with third countries , perhaps inspired from the nuclear energy field .
If we want to be successful , we must act together .
( DE ) Mr President , last Sunday reactionary nationalists brutally beat up homosexuals at a peace rally in Moscow , thereby hammering the image of an unfree Russia into our consciousness once again .
There is still discrimination against gays and lesbians on a massive scale .
In recent years , the German Green politician Volker Beck has been beaten and arrested at rallies .
It cannot be emphasised often enough how badly organised civil society is in Russia .
At the end of June a new EU-Russia Agreement is finally to be negotiated in Siberia .
We owe it to the people of Russia and of other autocratic regimes not to allow the issue of energy security to overshadow all other sectors .
Human rights and basic democratic freedoms must form the basis of this new agreement .
( PL ) Mr President , the Polish shipyard industry is under threat of total closure because the European Commission is demanding the return of sums provided from public aid .
The effect of this will be that thousands of employees on the Baltic will lose their jobs , and tens of thousands of employees at factories that work with the shipyards , both in Poland and in other EU countries , will likewise be out of work .
The European Commission is hiding behind the slogan of free competition , not wanting to admit to itself that during a period of massive price rises on a global scale some sections of the economy need to be protected , as Asiatic countries are doing .
The European Commission is unwilling to recall that the eastern Länder received more than one and a half billion marks in aid from the German Government , and that included shipyards located on the Baltic .
I am asking whether the people and the place where the solidarity movement began - the fall of the Berlin Wall , the liberation of Europe - must fall victim to arbitrary decisions taken in Brussels in the interests of speculators who are looking to make their fortunes out of the rubble and soil of the shipyards .
We are demanding that the European Commission take decisions that will enable the shipyard industry in Poland to be salvaged and developed .

( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , I would like your support for a review of Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 318 / 2007 , or for the return to the original material from 2005 , because of requests by breeding organisations trading in exotic birds in Germany , the Netherlands , Belgium and the Czech Republic .
The amendment basically relates to the ban on imports of exotic birds from the wild to the Union .
Taking into account the practical situation for breeding small birds , the conditions imposed on their import are difficult to fulfil .
It is obvious that the media hysteria surrounding bird flue was used to carry through the above-mentioned standard .
The EU has a system of quarantine facilities whereby avian diseases that pose a threat to people are intercepted .
On a number of occasions breeders have helped to return various animal species to the wild .
They respect the law protecting the most endangered species listed in CITES .
Banning only results in counter-pressures and attempts to bypass it .
The black market will take off , smuggling will flourish and the prices of birds will rise .
Health risks may also increase as a result .
If the standard and tried and tested veterinary regulations are observed , including the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , there is no need to retain this Regulation .
( PL ) Mr President , I wish to use the forum of the European Parliament to protest against the unlawful termination by the National Fund for Environmental Protection , which is subordinate to the Polish Government , of its contract with the Lux Veritatis Foundation to implement a geothermal investment for Toruń , while at the same time announcing that there will be no refund of the vast sums that the Foundation has spent on this investment .
The circumstances indicate that this decision has been dictated by political considerations , and it runs counter not only to domestic Polish law , but also to Community law , which proves that in the name of the battle against people perceived as political foes , the law is not being observed and support for renewable energy is not being permitted , which also breaches the fundamental EU principle of non-discrimination on political or religious grounds .
The former authorities of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management say that the application by the Lux Veritatis Foundation was checked very carefully and not found wanting in any way .

( SK ) Ladies and gentlemen , I want to inform you about an incident that happened in the United Kingdom recently .
A Slovak citizen who was working there legally exceeded the deadline for re-registration of his vehicle by four days and for this offence the British police threatened to destroy his vehicle .
While making their enquiries , the police behaved in a xenophobic and insulting manner , taking advantage of his passive knowledge of the English language .
All his documents were confiscated for no good reason , he was given a newspaper scrap instead of an official certificate of vehicle confiscation and his documentation , such as his European car insurance ( Green Card ) or Slovak authorisation , was not accepted by the British authorities either .
For this offence , and I mean just an offence , the British police and authorities threatened to scrap his vehicle .
I want to express my gratitude to my fellow Member Mr Chris Davies for his help in investigating this unfortunate case as well as to the other British Members who have taken an interest in the case .
I trust that such action by the British police is an isolated incident and that this attitude towards citizens working legally in the United Kingdom is the exception rather than the rule .
The deadline for the return of the vehicle expired yesterday , and as yet we have no information as to whether the vehicle has or has not been destroyed .
One way or another , our citizen does not have his vehicle even though the British authorities have received all the necessary documentation .
( BG ) Mr. President , Members of the European Parliament , In ten days , on 14 June 2008 , Bulgaria will pay tribute to the memory and life work of Alexander Stamboliiski , statesman , reformer and leader of the agrarian movement in the country .
He came to power in Bulgaria in 1919 , after two national disasters , dedicating his efforts to the national cause , to the modernisation and democratic renewal of the country .
He was overthrown through a coup d 'etat in 1923 .
He was killed most brutally but he remained immortal with his ideas of free and independent Bulgaria on the way to construction and integration into Europe .
Stamboliiski 's lessons in statesmanship sound particularly relevant today , 85 years after his tragic death , when Bulgaria is a member of the European Union .
The protection of national interests in the big European family , the preservation of the national identity side by side with the rapid adaptation to new realities should consolidate the efforts of all of us , citizens of unified Europe , for whom values are not just a hollow notion but a type of conduct , attitude and social response .
( BG ) Mr. President , the Bulgarian operational programmes within the framework of the EU funds were among the first to be approved by the Commission for the period from 2007 to 2013 .
WE must admit that , being a new Member State , we are confronted with various difficulties in their specific implementation .
Problems range from insufficient information to irregularities , even abuse with resources from the EU funds - " disorders ” that do not spare any single EU Member State .
The Bulgarian Government finds the absorption of funds to be a major task .
This has brought about radical reforms in all institutions responsible for the EU funds .
A Deputy Prime Minister has been appointed to ensure the overall coordination of the process .
The unsatisfactory results of the absorption of funds so far become arguments in a vehement campaign of the domestic opposition that has repeatedly tried to discredit the country even here , in the plenary hall of the European Parliament .
The references to anonymous sources predicting an apocalyptic report of the Commission for Bulgaria in July even before it has started writing it are suggestions for domestic political purposes only but they do not contribute to the resolution of problems .
Regrettably , the only thing they achieve is undermining the good name of my country .
I want to declare very clearly that the Bulgarian State undertakes radical measures in the respective spheres and has the firm will to overcome the existing problems .
Mr President , you are probably aware that the buildings of the European Parliament in Strasbourg contain a more widespread presence of asbestos than was originally anticipated .
Work for upgrading purposes and , more recently , for removal of the asbestos has been carried out since 2004 - apparently while the buildings have been in use .
This is , in my view , unwise and hazardous behaviour , because any work on asbestos-containing structures inevitably releases carcinogenic fibres into the atmosphere .
It is my opinion that the European Parliament in Strasbourg must not be used unless and until all asbestos is appropriately removed and the buildings have been thoroughly decontaminated .
In the interest of public health and transparency , I request that the President of this House make a fully comprehensive statement on this matter of asbestos removal from the European Parliament in Strasbourg as soon as possible .
( ES ) Mr President , we are currently facing a major fisheries crisis in the whole of the European Union , which is going to demand a rapid response from the European institutions .
I think that it is essential that we create a tripartite committee involving the public authorities , the unions and the shipowners .
In order to tackle the crisis once and for all , we cannot paper over the cracks ; we need to formulate a complete , structural proposal that covers every aspect of the crisis in the sector .
We obviously advocate responsible fishing ; we need to resolve the marketing of the product ; we need to deal with the shortage of crew in the fleets and ensure fair employment relations and a way out of their precarious situation for the workers .
I think that it is very important at the moment for the European Parliament to lend its support to finding a way out of this crisis , because it also affects quality employment , and we need to be able to deal with circumstances that arise .

Mr President , my London constituent , Mr Budd Margolis informs me that his Lithuanian relative , Rachel Margolis , has published her memoirs recounting her experiences in the Second World War .
She escaped from the Vilna Ghetto and then worked with the partisans fighting against the Nazis .
The Lithuanian authorities are now using her memoirs as evidence to prosecute surviving Jewish partisans as war criminals .
These include Yitzhak Arad , the former director of Israel 's Holocaust Centre , and Fania Brancovskaja , the librarian at the Yiddish Institute at Vilnius University .
Lithuania is under an obligation to prosecute surviving Second World War criminals but so far has not successfully prosecuted one .
Jewish partisans who fought against the Germans and their collaborators are regarded by some as traitors to Lithuania .
On behalf of many of my Jewish and non-Jewish constituents , I ask : where is the justice in persecuting Jewish partisans who fought against the Nazis , while the murderers of the Jews go unpunished ?
Mr President , across Europe we have seen wholly justified protests by fishermen about the sky-high price of fuel .
Some governments have faced up to their responsibilities ; others , like my own , have not .
We are supposed to have a common fisheries policy , but in many regions of Europe the approach is anything but common .
In my constituency local , small-trawler owners are paying a fuel bill of over EUR 2 000 per day .
Their plea for short-term aid has fallen on deaf ears , even though it lies within the power of the local minister to pay de minimis aid under state rules .
She has shamefully refused to do so .
Yet in France and Spain , government action has been taken .
How can you have a viable common fisheries policy with such disparity on the basic commodity of fuel ?
I condemn Minister Gildernew 's indifference and call not just for short-term aid but a long-term fuel strategy for our fishing sector .
( RO ) In a short time , the reports of the European Commission will be published reflecting the progress that Romania and Bulgaria have made regarding the justice reform .
Today , a year and a half after integration , more and more dissatisfied persons are speaking up on a European level , reaching the point that the progress achieved up to now is regarded as insignificant , compared to the assumed objectives .
Even though in some experts support that Romania and Bulgaria , should have been accepted to the European Union much earlier , I consider that these two new Member States must be further assisted and supported by the Commission and the Parliament .
Taking into account that next year the elections for the European Parliament will take place , I am convinced that the following months will be essential for Bulgaria and Romania to fully prove its European membership .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to raise an issue of linguistic discrimination within Parliament : the interface of MEPs ' computers functions only in English .
It is only possible to navigate our operating systems and access files using our computers if we have a command of the English language .
This seems to me to be totally discriminatory as regards those MEPs who , although they do not know English , would like to manage their work directly on their own computers .
This is a problem of linguistic authorisation which our friends in the Esperanto movement are trying to tackle at the United Nations , and I am not too sure what the francophony movement is dealing with if it is not also dealing with this issue .
I hope , Mr President , that this problem can be remedied , and that a remedy can also be found for the technological discrimination I encountered when I tabled a written question on 2 June in an open format - the ODF format - different from the Microsoft format which is currently in use .
The reply I received from the department responsible was that it was not possible to table questions in an open format .
I hope that these forms of linguistic and technological discrimination may be promptly overcome .
( EL ) Mr President , the price increases of all mass-market consumer goods , transport and services combined with low wages and pensions , and drastic cuts in social welfare benefits have inflicted repeated damage on people 's incomes while generating enormous profits for monopoly business groups .
Prices have risen uncontrollably for ordinary working-class families in all Member States .
Those who try to blame the high prices on a few bad speculators are deceiving the people .
They are hiding the fact that high prices are fuelled by the profits of monopolies , and free market and competition policies , which are at the very basis of the EU itself and its policies that have been shaped and implemented by Member States and their governments .
High prices start with the monopoly on production and trade , which is dominated by the business groups plundering people 's incomes , and crushing thousands of small businesses and undertakings .
We call on the workers to step up their struggle for real wage increases , pensions , social welfare benefits , and the abolition of VAT on common consumer goods , services of general interest and fuel , in a bid to reduce the prices of public utilities .
( HU ) On 15 May , a piece of legislation was created in the USA which is a milestone in the crisis surrounding illegal logging , which can be experienced worldwide .
Congress was the first in the world to pass such an Act , which bans the import of illegally logged wood .
In 2006 , 10 % of imports to the United States were produced from illegally logged wood .
Following the adoption of the Act , analyses have emphasised that this Act is helping the competitiveness of American factories , protects jobs , and sends a clear message to which forestry communities will listen .
My question is this : how long will the European Union wait , and what is it waiting for ?
It is shameful and disgraceful that we are waiting with our arms folded .
But we MEPs can do something : I recommend that everyone sign petition 23 , which was presented a couple of months ago and the aim of which is for us to persuade the Commission to introduce legislation at last , after the United States , while we still have forests . Thank you very much .
Mr President , I want to draw your attention to the plight of one of my constituents , Alan Jones , from Knighton , a rural town in the West Midlands , who is a striking example of an entrepreneur in Europe who has been let down by the absence of high-speed broadband connection in rural areas .
He wants to set up a small online company that will offer photo-framing services .
He , as a person with a disability , working from home , would be ideal to start up a new business .
However , there is only one Internet service provider who has a monopoly of broadband in the town and , although it is expanding , the connection is extremely slow and simply not conducive to running a business .
The Commission has a plan to bridge the digital divide and expand broadband to rural areas , and it urgently needs to solve the problems of Internet service providers and ensure there are adequate resources , and that areas are not lagging behind in terms of quality and high speed and low cost .
What I would like you to do , Mr President , is to make sure that the Commission ensures that entrepreneurs like Mr Jones are not prevented or frustrated from starting up businesses , which prevents the creation of much-needed jobs in rural areas .
( LT ) The European Commission and members of the WTO are rushing to finalise the Doha talks on agriculture and the opening of the market for industrial goods , NAMA .
The significant influence of the current situation in the United States , the election , is evident .
However , compared with the suspension of the round in 2006 , the NAMA issue is obviously a step backwards .
Highly developed countries are managing to maintain an almost unchanged environmental situation .
EU textile and clothing tariffs will be down from 12 to 4 % .
The markets of emerging economies will not open , as it is not tariffs , but the obligations of maximum tariffs that are to be curtailed .
Besides , an 18-year transitional period is to be applied to China , the country that flooded Europe and the rest of the world with low-quality goods .
The tabled NAMA project is unacceptable to Lithuania and other EU countries , as it would jeopardise their competitiveness .
There is an obvious balance between agriculture and NAMA .
The EU should not race to complete the Doha talks merely on account of its economy .
I would urge the Commission to take its time and represent the EU countries ' interests fairly .
( PT ) Mr President , I should like to congratulate the fishermen from different countries of the European Union , and from Portugal in particular , on their fight to protect the strategic fisheries sector , as well as jobs , decent wages and living conditions for thousands of fishermen and their families .
Faced with a common fisheries policy and a European Union that is indifferent to the longstanding socio-economic crisis this sector is undergoing , that has become all the more acute due to increases in the price of and financial speculation on fuel - diesel and petrol - fishermen have finally shown that there are solutions and measures that should have been taken a long time ago .
Solutions and measures requiring the European Union to stop turning a deaf ear , adopting new policies that protect and promote the fisheries sector , not its slow agony and ruin .
Fisheries have a future .
I cannot conclude this brief intervention without acknowledging the thousands of workers who will be demonstrating in Lisbon tomorrow in defence of their achievements and labour rights .
( CS ) Mr President , the enlargement of the Schengen area was excellent news for the citizens of my country , a symbol of the equality of Czech citizens with the other countries of the Union .
Sadly , today 's newspapers are full of headlines about Czech drivers being hassled by German and Austrian police .
Since April systematic and detailed checks on buses and private cars with Czech registration plates have been carried out in Germany and Austria .
After just over a month of general checking , Austria announced its intention to carry out checks , starting in June , in connection with the European Football Championship .
That is fair enough .
However , I strongly object to general checks on Czech drivers in Germany .
This is a one-sided decision that is difficult to explain and it is damaging neighbourly relations .
I get letters from citizens asking for the Czech authorities to retaliate .
This is not a good situation and it will also affect the political climate prior to the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty .
I have already submitted an appeal and now I am asking my fellow German Members to look into this matter at home in Germany .
( RO ) Dear colleagues , I would like to welcome the shares program initiated by the Council of Europe , which aims to eliminate all forms of violence among children and I am convinced that in 2009 physical punishment will be forbidden all over the world .
Yet , I would like to underline the need for a common campaign on a European level , by means of which children become aware of the fact that violence towards them is against the law and that they must confess any ill treatment they are subjected to .
In some EU Member States , parents regard physical punishment as a normal method of education and children assume this as being normal .
The future of the European Union depends on the way children 's rights are observed , and during their education we must have in mind an approach that forbids any form of violence .
( PT ) Eurofound recently reported that 25 % of redundancies in Portugal between 2003 and 2006 stemmed from company relocations .
Records show that several multinationals have done so after having received millions of euros in community aid and after making millions in profit , which is unacceptable .
There are cases of workers still not having received the compensation to which they are entitled , as is the case in Vila Nova de Gaia and Brax , whose workers went to the Courthouse door yesterday to call for the compensation money that they have been owed for five years .
Unemployment is also acting as a justification for ever more precarious employment , to which the Government responds with more attempts to set back labour rights .
I therefore welcome the day of action that the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers ( CGTP ) is holding tomorrow in Lisbon , Portugal .
Mr President , I would just like to draw the attention of the House to the conference that is taking place in Rome on the global food crisis .
We have expressed our concerns in this House about this issue in our recent resolution on food prices .
One of the key issues is the under-investment in agriculture , both in the developed and the developing world .
The extent of that problem was brought home to me at a conference in Ireland just last week , when a Missionary Sister of the Holy Rosary , Nora MacNamara , mentioned very clearly that , when she was involved in agriculture many years ago in Africa , there was investment .
And then , she said , Africa - or rather agriculture - became a dirty word when looking for funds to support projects in this area .
We need to go back to our roots in terms of investing in agriculture .
Can I just say , in the debate on the Treaty of Lisbon in Ireland , that this Treaty will actually enhance the European Union 's role in the developing world and , in my view , will assist us in meeting the food crisis which we are now facing not just in Europe , but globally .

( HU ) In February this year , Mr Erdogan , the Turkish Prime Minister , gave an extremely controversial speech in Cologne , in which he called assimilation a crime against humanity .
From a position of freedom to choose one 's identity , this statement is unacceptable ; preserving cultural diversity is an important goal , but the decision cannot be taken away from the individual .
The natural situation for Turks in Western Europe may be dual identity .
Erdogan 's requirement for a Turkish-language university in Germany is unrealistic , since in many countries of the Union the indigenous national minorities who have lived there for many hundreds of years do not have their own state university , like the Hungarians in Transylvania , where the Hungarian community was deprived of an independent state university during the Communist dictatorship .
It is important that Turkey does not manipulate the migrant minorities living in Western Europe for interior policy aims .
It would also be good if Prime Minister Erdogan put his own house in order in the areas of the situation of the Kurds , acknowledging the genocide of Armenians and equality of rights for women .
( RO ) Mister President , European socialists hope that Europe becomes an example for the whole world in terms of life quality .
The 27 Member States are now building a new social Europe which will bring prosperity to all citizens of the European Union .
From the Union 's budget for 2008 , almost 45 % is allocated to growth , innovation , job creation and economic and social cohesion , and 42,6 % is allocated to agriculture .
Rural areas represent 90 % of the European Union territory .
Despite the EURO 41 million allocated to agriculture in 2008 , the increase of costs for agricultural works and the increase in energy prices brought about an increase in prices of agricultural products and caused the economic situation to deteriorate .
I consider that the grants policy for agriculture and adequate conditions for the promotion of investments in the field are the answer to part of the challenges the Union will encounter in the following years .
A developed agriculture will allow all European citizens to have access to healthy food and sufficient quantities , at affordable prices .
Healthy nutrition is a fundamental aspect of life quality .
That concludes this item .
Generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 ( debate )
The next item is the report by Helmuth Markov , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the proposal for a Council regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 and amending Regulations ( EC ) No 552 / 97 , No 1933 / 2006 and Commission Regulations ( EC ) No 964 / 2007 and No 1100 / 2006 - C6-0051 / 2008 - .



Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me first apologise on behalf of Peter Mandelson , who is not able to be here to discuss with this House the regulation on the generalised system of preferences ( GSP ) .
He has asked me to speak on his behalf .
I thank you for your work and the valuable comments made on the proposal for a GSP regulation for 2009-2011 .
The Commission considered it important that Parliament should be able to express its opinion , and we really appreciate the effort you have made to examine the proposals and provide an opinion , even in a rather short timetable .
We therefore welcome the opinion and the opportunity to engage with you and explain the Commission 's position .
The GSP scheme is an important pro-development instrument of EU trade policy .
The Commission therefore appreciates the recognition in the opinion that the EU 's GSP is the most important such scheme among the developed countries and that it continues to make an important contribution to the objective of promoting development and poverty reduction in the developing world .
We share the objective expressed by Parliament that the scheme should continue to operate in a stable , transparent and predictable manner .
These aspects are important for the beneficiary countries themselves , giving them and economic operators within the EU a firmer basis for their own decision-making on trade and investment opportunities .
The Commission considers that all three components of the scheme - the standard GSP for all beneficiaries , the ' GSP Plus ' for those countries that make specific commitments in terms of adherence to international standards for good governance and sustainable development , and the Everything But Arms initiative for the least-developed countries - are operating well and in line with the overall policy orientations put in place for the period 2006-2015 .
That is why the basic approach underpinning the proposed regulation for 2009-2011 is one of continuity in substance , combined with some technical updating .
We are working actively with the Member States in the Council towards agreement on the final regulation .
The Presidency has set the objective of achieving this before the end of June .
That is something the Commission supports , since an early decision is important to ensure that beneficiary countries and all other interested parties , including business operators , have sufficient notice of the changes to be made next January .
Another very important reason for an early decision is that all those countries that wish to apply for ' GSP Plus ' treatment will have to do so by the end of October and need confirmation as soon as possible of the relevant criteria and the process they will have to follow .
I would note that some of Parliament 's comments and suggestions in fact relate to issues that go beyond the scope of this regulation , even if they are certainly issues of importance from a development perspective .
Reform of the EC 's preferential rules of origin , including for the purpose of the GSP , is being taken forward in a separate exercise headed by Commissioner Kovács .
A number of comments also touch on the need to ensure that developing countries are able to access sufficient and good-quality aid for trade to help them build trade capacity and harness the potential of trade to drive their own economic growth and sustainable development .
Here the European Union has already demonstrated its strong commitment and , in the EU Aid for Trade strategy of October 2007 , has put in place a firm basis on which to make yet further improvements .
In conclusion , let me repeat that we very much appreciate the interest shown by Parliament in these proposals .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , development cooperation and trade are usually the most important external forces able to contribute to a country 's development .
Non-reciprocal tariff preferences for developing countries are an important and internationally recognised instrument that the European Union has been using for many years .
Three kinds of arrangements are currently in force .
Firstly , the general arrangement that applies to all beneficiary countries .
Secondly , the GSP + incentive scheme , which provides additional benefits for countries implementing certain international standards in human and labour rights , environmental protection , the fight against drugs , and good governance .
Thirdly , the special arrangement for the least-developed countries , which in theory offers them duty-free and quota-free access to the EU internal market for ' Everything But Arms ' .
My personal view here is that it is absolutely fatal that that there is still no legally binding regulation banning exports of arms from the European Union to these countries .
All the trade preferences in the world are of no use if violent conflicts destroy the basis of a functioning national economy .
The report before us contains improvements to the Commission proposal for the GSP system for the period from January 2009 to December 2011 under the following items :
Firstly , improvement in application and effectiveness .
This also includes shortening the amendment and test deadlines from three-year to one-year periods .
Secondly , developing rules for a reform process in which the beneficiaries are included as appropriate .
Thirdly , coherence with the multilateral framework of the WTO and thereby , of course , with the objectives of the Doha Development Round .
Ranking among these , along with the necessary impact assessment of the development capability of the EU 's trade policy instruments , is , in first place , the fact that reform of the EU 's rules of origin is taking place at the same time as the new GSP scheme comes into force , and secondly and above all , that rules on the requirements for beneficiary countries are being improved .
I am therefore thinking , for example , of the possibility of inter-regional and cross-regional cumulation .
This means that a product produced in a regional but cross-border production process does not fall short of GSP acceptance on the basis of meaningless country of origin rules .
Fourthly , securing democratic and parliamentary control of the implementation and adaptation , if necessary , of the regulation currently in force .
I should like to say here that I welcome the Commission 's inclusion of Parliament in the consultation process at this point in time , but that Parliament will have to make joint decisions on these issues in future on a fairly regular basis .
I assume from this that the Commission will take our amendments seriously this time instead of largely ignoring them , as in the case of the own-initiative report on reform two years ago .
A comment on the GSP + incentive scheme : I think it is extremely important when evaluating the human rights situation and good governance - not just in trade relations - that the various countries are not measured by different standards .
At the same time it is perfectly clear , however , that a rash abandonment of trade preferences can have disastrous consequences for the population of a developing country and even for the human rights situation there , too .
The decision on how well or badly the international agreements specified in the annex to the current regulation are actually implemented and whether preferences should be abandoned if necessary should therefore be tested extremely carefully .
I should like to support Amendment 37 tabled here , which reminds us that every possibility should be checked so that the countries not among the least-developed and that have not signed any economic partnership agreement can enjoy a new framework for trade , which offers trade preferences that at least correspond to those of the Cotonou Agreement .
In this connection I should like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Development - and Mr Kaczmarek over there - for their cooperation and willingness to compromise .
The Committee on International Trade has been able to accept this report unanimously , including the contents of the opinion of the Committee on Development .
There has been extensive agreement with the Council and the Commission - we also had regular debates on this - and I therefore hope that the regulation can enter into force as planned in good time and that there will be no disparities between the current and the new preference period .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development . - ( PL ) Mr President , the international community recognises trade as a fundamental factor of development .
More active inclusion of developing countries in multilateral relations is a very important stage on the road to eliminating world poverty .
The generalised tariff preferences system does not , therefore , help the development of EU trade .
It primarily serves to support developing countries , including the least developed ones .
The main objectives of the system should consequently be to reduce poverty and to facilitate sustainable development and good governance in developing countries , as well as to implement the Millennium Goals .
As draftsman for the Committee on Development I would like to emphasise that Mr Markov 's report is a very good one , and I would like to thank both the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade for accepting the opinion of the Committee on Development .
These two committees have not always worked together in such harmony as has been evident in this case , so I would like to express my sincere thanks .
Among the issues we recognised jointly as being the most important are : strengthening Parliament 's role in the system decision-making process - to increase transparency , legal certainty and democratic control ; to make it easier to establish the country of origin principle - in order to optimise the application of preferences , e.g. through inter-regional cumulation , which will at the same time promote regional cooperation in poorer countries ; equal treatment for all countries as candidates for GSP + , regardless of when they meet the system 's criteria ; and last but not least , the most penetrative , complete and detailed analysis of the effect of the system before its next review for the years 2013-2014 .
Parliament would like to know the effects of the functioning of the system .
Key to this is knowledge of the extent to which the tariff preferences system helps to limit poverty .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , the system under debate here serves to combat poverty and backwardness .
Three points seem to me to be important here .
First , since this is now the continuation : there should be flexibility both on entering the system and on leaving it , if parameters were to be changed in one state .
In other words : must a state that was once a beneficiary always remain a beneficiary ?
This does not appear to be the case to me .
We should not forget that the EU also has a duty to its own citizens , workers and consumers .
There must be a reciprocal advantage ; it should not always be one-sided .
Secondly , we welcome the fact that the European Parliament is to be informed during the next term .
We would also like an assessment of this system , however .
This assessment should provide a comparison with other preferential measures such as the EPA , for example .
We would realistically state that statistically , a gap is continually opening up between rich and poor , despite the EU 's diverse measures and despite the measures of the Member States .
Are our certainly well-intentioned efforts still leading to the right results ?
We ought to be asking ourselves this question quite deliberately .
Thirdly , preferential measures such as , for example , the GSP system we are discussing here , should be linked to the following criteria .
We need a certain strictness here .
First , the promotion of democracy and the rule of law .
Second , the construction of a minimum framework on social and environmental standards in the beneficiary states .
We want to provide assistance with this , which is also clearly stated in the report .
We should not be backing down , however , for the sake of our own credibility .
My thanks at this point go to the rapporteur for his effective cooperation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when Parliament voiced its opinion on the application of the GSP for the 2005-2008 period , the Commission did not see fit to incorporate its proposals .
We stand by these priorities today , particularly the fact that Parliament must be more involved in the allocation and monitoring of the various GSP schemes .
The role of representatives of civil society , and social partners in particular , must also be strengthened .
They represent a valuable source of information when checking that the main conventions governing the allocation of GSP + have been implemented .
On this point , I am pleased that the new regulation will be tougher on the respect for good governance provisions relating to workers ' rights , human rights and the environment .
The Union must have faith in its values and encourage its trading partners not only to ratify its conventions , but also to implement them concretely .
This is why we are asking the Commission to incorporate one of our proposals which is essential for the GSP + to continue acting as an incentive .
At present , a country which is not eligible for GSP + from 2009 will have to wait until the introduction of the next regulation in 2012 in order to reapply .
We would like it to be possible to submit new applications every year so that developing countries have a real incentive to implement these conventions as soon as possible to benefit from the GSP + .
Finally , I would like to remind everyone of the need to reform the rules of origin in order to have a global , simplified and harmonised system based on strengthening regional integration , which remains its primary vocation .
Calculations of national added value must therefore take into account the particular situation of poor countries , which are not able to benefit if the rules of origin are too restrictive .
With the GSP , the Union has a means of fostering not only the integration of developing countries within world trade , but also of spreading good governance .
Parliament 's proposals would allow progress on both counts .
We hope that they will be incorporated by the Commission .
Mr President , the EU gives the most in financial aid to the third world .
However , third world countries are in need of more than just money .
It is extremely important that those countries ' economies are developed and strengthened .
I very much support trade between Europe , and African , Caribbean and Pacific countries .
I cannot agree with the World Trade talks in Geneva .
The deal on offer will in no way benefit European agriculture ; it will not help food security in Europe - or indeed , in Ireland .
We are not the only ones , however , who are dissatisfied .
America is also dissatisfied .
And of the 152 countries involved in global trading it would appear that only two are satisfied .
I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the decision made by the Farmers ' Association in Ireland to accept and support the Lisbon Treaty .
In about a week 's time the referendum on the Treaty will take place in Ireland .
I would also like to say that we would like the Treaty to be authorized and adopted so that we will be stronger and more unified in the process involving future world talks .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , on the face of it , I should be in favour of this report which seeks to help under-developed nations .
After all , Britain 's Commonwealth preference system was of enormous benefit to the less well-off members of the British Commonwealth , but then I do not suppose you want to hear how a wicked post-imperial power actually helped its poorer neighbours .
The problem is that EU programmes always turn out to have the opposite effect to that intended .
The CFP , intended to conserve fish stocks , is a disaster as a result of which the EU , by the votes of this House , has awarded licences to EU fishing fleets to raid the waters of one Third World country after another , bringing poverty and starvation where once there was at least subsistence level .
Excess sugar production is dumped on the Third World , to which the answer evidently is to reduce European production , not put it to better use .
Poor-quality EU tobacco grown with EUR 18 million of our taxpayers ' money every year was dumped where it did most harm .
Now we are told this money will go on anti-smoking propaganda , not Third World aid .
EU aid programmes are a classic case of giving with one hand and taking back with the other .
The CAP restricts imports , hampering developing nations while at the same time dumping its excess in the Third World .
Poor local farmers are thus put out of business , pulling the rug from under the very countries that the GSP is meant to help .
Food prices are spiralling so much that former Soviet Union leader , Mikhail Gorbachev , is warning of a food revolution .
While all this is going on , the EU is promoting biofuel targets , which will impact on food production in the Third World more than anywhere .
So this House can wax lyrical about how the EU 's GSP programme will come to the aid of less-developed nations , but the truth is that EU policies will only help to ensure that the poor stay poor , the hungry stay hungry , and the less-developed nations stay undeveloped .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to reiterate the importance of the Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) for the economic and trade development of the beneficiary countries .
Parliament 's amendments have largely improved the proposal for a regulation , which will cover the 2009-2011 period , and have focused on aspects that could improve the conditions for using the system by these beneficiary countries , such as provision of technical assistance by the European Union , which is a fundamental element for taking better advantage of the trade benefits of the GSP .
It is also worth highlighting the possibility for some countries to apply for inclusion in the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development , GSP + , which is more advantageous , and moreover the fact that they can do so every year .
I think , however , that some of the amendments adopted in the Committee on International Trade go too far .
Amendment 8 , regarding the possibility that countries that are not the final recipients of exports can benefit from the more favourable GSP + and Everything But Arms arrangements , could be detrimental to some countries that really do deserve to be included in these arrangements .
In general , it could create more confusion in the application of the GSP and of the rules of origin .
This is an issue that should be left for the next review of the rules of origin .
I think that there is also a need to highlight , as some of my colleagues have done , the importance of the European Commission presenting studies assessing the impact of the GSP in the beneficiary countries .
I think , however , that this study should focus on the purely trade aspects and not cover other areas that do not fall under the scope of this regulation .
Finally , I would like to point out , echoing the Chairman of the committee himself , Mr Markov , that our amendments strengthen the role of the European Parliament in the application of the regulation .
What is being considered in the regulation is the future role of the European Parliament in trade policy once the Lisbon Treaty has been adopted , as I hope it will be .
Mr President , I should just like to make one very brief point to the Commissioner .
The Commissioner rightly mentioned that GSP + is about sustainable development and it is connected , as the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade said , to the Millennium Goals .
This is very important and I remember very well , when we discussed this kind of scheme for the first time , that we said we needed to evaluate and re-evaluate how valuable it is for the countries and for ourselves .
There is one topic to which I would very much like to draw your attention , which might become a complicated and tricky one in the future , concerning those countries that are operating within the scheme but which have a complicated environment .
For example , Sri Lanka , which would love to fulfil the goals , but because of many conditions - and I do not want to go into the details - might not be capable of doing so .
I am not arguing that we should change our system .
I would just ask the Commission - as my colleague Kader Arif has already done - to be very careful in evaluating each individual case .
I would ask you to come back to our committee and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs when you have carried out the evaluation and then please come back to this House , and let us have an evaluation and a discussion on the topic I mentioned .
( SV ) Let me begin by saying that I think the Generalised System of Preferences is an extremely good instrument for development , because it binds together trade and development in a very clear manner and gives tariff concessions and hence access to European markets to those countries which make an effort .
It is also important that we do use it as a development tool .
Now this is a technical review , and it is important that we do not exacerbate matters for those who need development aid most but , on the contrary , strengthen the development dimension .
I think that in many ways this review does that in an excellent way and it advances the tool in the right direction , but it does not really go the whole distance .
I think for example of Vietnam .
Vietnam is heavily dependent on a single product group , namely shoes .
As you no doubt know , the GSP system has a threshold value which says that a country must achieve over 50 % of the value of its exports in order to be guaranteed GSP status .
At the moment Vietnam falls below 50 % .
That is because of us , because of Europe - we must be aware of that - and because we have penalised Vietnam with tariffs on shoe exports in particular .
Regardless of this , they continue to be heavily dependent on their shoe exports , not least poor women in Vietnam .
So I wonder : why can they not keep their preference ?
It is after all only 3.5 % .
It is not the case that they lose , that they get entirely tariff-free access ; they just get somewhat lower tariffs .
Besides , in the future we shall have a free trade agreement with Vietnam .
So I wonder : why throw them out now when we are about to take them in and absorb these exports through a free trade agreement ?
I therefore hope that you will look at this during the next period of application , so that no country ends up in this situation , in this limbo into which I think we are putting Vietnam in the GSP system .
( PT ) The Generalised System of Preferences has proved to be a key trade policy instrument for promoting development and eradicating poverty in the world 's most fragile countries and regions through their progressive integration into the international trading system .
As has already been said here , the European Union has three types of arrangements aimed at promoting such development .
For the most part , the mechanisms in force work well but they could , of course , be honed further and the European Parliament must actively participate to make sure that this fine-tuning does in fact occur .
In the main , this report clearly aims at this .
The proposals it contains on such important issues as reform and clarification of rules of origin appear to be very relevant , in terms of promoting the principle of regional aggregation , assessing the impact of the outcome of the current Doha Round negotiations and the call for more technical assistance for the least developed countries so that they can benefit fully from this aid .
All these concerns point in one direction : making these instruments more useful to the poorest countries , thus contributing decisively to achieving their ultimate goal of fighting backwardness , poverty and the absolute injustice that are still brought about in the world by underdevelopment .
Mr President , like many of my colleagues in the House today , I welcome the amendments that are intended to improve the Commission 's proposals in line with the rapporteur 's proposals .
It is not often on the Committee on International Trade that we can say that , and that we have that sort of consensus across the parties .
His proposal is to produce a more effective system that better responds to the interests of beneficiary countries , to develop rules for a better regulated reform process , to ensure that regulation is in line with democratic control and parliamentary scrutiny , to bring the GSP scheme into line with the WTO and the Doha Round , and also to improve the transparency of GSP .
In this spirit , I would like to urge my colleagues to support a cross-party global campaign calling for real trade , of which I am the co-chairman with Abdi Abdirahman , the Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly .


We call for five things : let us abolish agricultural subsidies ; let us abolish agricultural tariffs ; let us liberalise rules of origin ; let us stop supporting corrupt governments through direct budgetary support and place more emphasis on aid for trade , so that we can invest in things like infrastructure ; and let us incentivise low-income countries to remove barriers between each other .
However , we should also call on governments of poorer countries to consider doing the same for basic essentials .
It is morally wrong for poor people to pay more for food and medicines because of government import tariffs .
Yes , the EU should open up its markets , but this good work is often undermined if other governments restrict access and keep prices high purely for ideological reasons .
So , we should all work together to fight trade tariffs that condemn the poor .
We should end government subsidies that incentivise tyranny , and we should always be a friend of those who want to work their way out of poverty , because with our help they will end world hunger .
( CS ) Mr President , today we are debating a change in the preferential rates of customs duties for developing countries for the next three years .
I fully support Mr Helmuth Markov 's call for greater flexibility in his report .
Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl 's amendments are important .
The European Commission must undertake a far more detailed analysis of the impact of generalised tariff preferences on the economies of developing countries , and examine their effect on the European economy and on consumer protection .
It is not just the GSP but also non-tariff measures , humanitarian aid or - on the contrary - sanctions in respect of serious violations of human rights or international agreements that affect the development of the poorest countries .
Consequently , we must insist on serious and in-depth analyses of the impact of all these measures on developing countries : only when we have the results should we modify the tariffs , in a more flexible manner than today .
This should not be an isolated process .
The modifications should go hand in hand with all the other measures .
We should also improve the way in which our development policy is coordinated with the US and other countries .
( PL ) Mr President , if the objective of our actions is the reduction of poverty in third countries and economic integration , then the European Union 's tariff preferences programme really is the right way to go about it .
We must at the same time remember that it is essential to strive for maximum transparency in the customs system .
This is why I believe it is necessary to monitor this process , and at the end of each stage it would be worth taking a look here in this House , in successive debates , at the results of the solutions currently being implemented .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am impressed by the intriguing questions of the honourable Members , especially the fact that nearly every one is critically constructive .
All are involved in the whole procedure and doing their utmost to make it a good proposal .
I can assure you that Peter Mandelson will pay attention to your input - there is no doubt about that - and that he will take the amendments seriously and not ignore them .
I know Peter a bit better .
He is not the kind of person who would ignore such proposals and such thoughts , but he would like to look at it from both sides - helping developing countries ( especially the least developed , as Mr Kaczmarek mentioned ) is what he has in mind .
However , the aim is to be both objective and predictable .
Regarding Mrs Mann 's invitation to come back ( and I am sure she is asking for Peter Mandelson to come back , although I would be delighted to come back ) , I am sure he will take up the invitation .
Mr Ó Neachtain put it in a wider perspective , and I am pleased with the Geneva WTO discussions .
Peter Mandelson will not be surprised at the views of the honourable Member .
And Mr Kamall urged that we do our utmost and be a friend to those who want to work .
I thank you again for all the proposals .
The draft is in Council , where the Member States will reflect on Parliament 's amendments to ensure that stability guidelines for the GSP are established for 2005-2015 .
What is the reason leading the Commission not to introduce significant changes ?
After one year of operations it is too early to make conclusive observations , but this is something we will no doubt come back to .

Concerning the questions by Mr Kaczmarek and Mr Audy : the ultimate objectives of the scheme are indeed education and the eradication of poverty .
At the same time , the EU provides an incentive for sustainable development , good governance and human rights , as well as labour standards and child labour in particular .
Concerning aid : the GSP tariff preferences provide market access to developed countries .
Aid programmes are governed under the EU Joint Aid for Trade strategy which , among other objectives , claims to enable developing countries to benefit from the GSP .
Mrs Mann and Mr Fjellner mentioned Sri Lanka .
At the moment Sri Lanka benefits from the GSP + .
There are no indications that it would stop benefiting from GSP arrangements in the future .
Each and every country 's situation is assessed carefully , transparently and following the provisions of the regulations .
One question asked that the application process of the GSP + scheme be more frequent than once every three years - I have already touched upon this - so let us make a deal that it should be flexible but we should not just stick to one year .
Mrs Mann asked how the application for the GSP + will be assessed .
The monitoring and evaluation of compliance with the eligibility requirements of the GSP + arrangement is based on the findings of the monitoring mechanisms established under the auspices of the relevant international organisation , such as the UN and ILO and other agencies , as well as on the monetary mechanism emphasised in the conventions themselves and made publicly available by these agencies .
This provides for unambiguous and impartial review processes .
I would like to answer Mr Arif 's question on the situation of the Commission in GSP + beneficiary countries in terms of the implementation of human rights conventions and the correlative standards .
I can assure you that the Commission is following closely the developments of the current GSP + beneficiaries in respect to their compliance with the GSP + relevant international conventions .
I shall just mention the example of El Salvador ( which is a GSP + beneficiary country , as you are aware ) , with regard to which the Commission , in consultation with EU Member States , has recently launched an investigation into its compliance with GSP + obligations .
I can assure you that the proper implementation of the EU trade arrangements is one of the Commission 's priorities .
We pay close attention to the GSP + beneficiaries ' compliance , and these issues are regularly raised in our bilateral contacts with those countries .
Concerning the new GSP rules of origin and how they will contribute to the GSP objectives : they are currently being discussed in the context of a general broad reform of the rules of origin .
The Taxation and Customs Union DG is chef de file , so that concerns my colleague Mr Kovács .
The aim is to render them more development-friendly , and that process is governed in consultation with the developing countries .
The last point concerns shoes in Vietnam , which was one of the examples .
The exclusion - or graduation , for it is fair to use that word of Vietnamese products falling under section 12 ( I am now talking about the footwear of the combined nomenclature from the benefits under the proposed GSP regulation for the years 2009-2011 ) - is being given full attention by all the relevant Commission services .
The Commission has also been in close contact with Vietnam on this issue in order to provide all necessary assistance and expertise .
Concerning the graduation of Vietnam in relation to Section 12 , this results from the technical and objective application of the GSP provisions and reflects the fact that Vietnamese exports of these products are more competitive on the Community market .
In addition , Vietnam has successfully diversified its export base .
That is a positive point and means that footwear is no longer so dominant .
That is another , significant sign of increasing competitiveness .
So the COM proposal for the graduation of Vietnam is based on extensive objectives and statistical analyses applied in the same way to all GSP + beneficiaries .

rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , we could say that there was major agreement in this House over the fact that the GSP + system is a very positive one .
I would , of course , have been happy to ask the Commission or Mr Mandelson , who is not here , however , how he would in fact be pressing the Andean countries , for example , two countries that very much want to retain GSP , to conclude free-trade agreements as part of the Partnership and Association Agreements .
Ecuador and Bolivia want to retain this GSP + .
We shall then be able to get involved with it .
It will indeed get them somewhere .
The second question is whether or not we should be considering developing the GSP + system further into a GSP + + .
The challenges ahead of us are entirely new .
We have climate change , we have rising food prices .
We could perhaps consider whether to introduce new paragraphs and new assessment standards .
I am very happy , Commissioner , that you have made some very clear statements on Sri Lanka , because this was also my Committee 's concern , and Mrs Mann has carried this out with determination once again .
Finally , my thanks once again to all those with whom I needed to work .
We enjoyed good cooperation .
I think that we are a small step further ahead and that this GSP + system is very valuable and necessary as part of the European Union 's trade agreement .
I also think that we do not always have to concentrate solely on free-trade agreements .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
From its settlement , SGP was one of the main tools of EU trade and development policies .
The main objective of the EU and SGP development policy is to contribute to poverty reduction , the promotion of sustainable development and good governance , principles that are recognised by international conventions and tools , such as the Millennium Declaration , Rio Declaration - 1992 , OIM-1998 Declaration .
With the application of SGP in 1971 , the EU facilitated international trade with the developing countries and the less developed countries , providing them the necessary technical assistance for observing the international conventions and building the necessary institutional and regulation framework so as to take advantage of international trade and SGP .
At the same time , following the verified notification , and after EP notification , the CE may apply the sanction of temporary withdrawal of the preferences of those countries that violate the inclusion criteria in the beneficiaries ' list .
The report underlines the importance of the public consultation process , the involvement of the target beneficiaries and the consolidation of the EP democratic control .
Because both SGP and the list of beneficiary countries are revised every three years , the Council is asked not to delay their submission so that they might be approved by the EP , avoiding the gaps in international trade .
I congratulate the rapporteur .
The work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007 ( debate ) ( debate )
The next item is the report by Alain Hutchinson , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007 .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report I prepared for the Committee on Development reviews the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly ( JPA ) in 2007 .
Those of you who are actively involved in this work or are simply interested in it know that it is not a purely formal or symbolic structure , indeed quite the reverse , since the Assembly increasingly functions as a true parliamentary assembly .
Its members are increasingly engaged in it , influential figures sound it out and as a result it is acquiring growing political importance .
This is the first point that I wanted to emphasise .
The growing political importance of this Assembly also derives from the fact that apart from the fundamental issues relating to cooperation between ACP and EU countries , it also discusses issues which are topical both for Europeans and ACP countries .
This is the case , for example , with the Economic Partnership Agreements negotiated between the Union and ACP countries .
On this issue , the JPA has confirmed with the Kigali Declaration that the leaders concerned clearly want the European Commission to give ACP countries enough time to negotiate regional development agreements .
Kigali is not only an opportunity to show that there is real resistance to these agreements , as they currently exist , but also that this resistance is founded on concerns which are entirely legitimate and which must now be properly taken into account .
In the same way , it is only through participating in the work of the Assembly that many MPs in ACP countries have learnt of the existence of Country Strategy Papers that define areas of cooperation between the EU and their own countries .
This serves as a reminder that , for many MPs in ACP countries , the Assembly is sometimes the only possible forum for democratic expression .
I would also like to stress that in 2007 we witnessed the increasing engagement of civil society in ACP countries , with excellent meetings and initiatives being organised on the sidelines of each JPA session .
In the fight for development by civil society in ACP countries , the Assembly also represents an extraordinary opportunity for exchange and encounter .
In this respect , the Union must be able to support , technically and financially , the presence of these associations and NGOs in the work of the JPA .
Finally , I would like to underline that in our report , we encourage the JPA to strengthen the role of its Committee on Political Affairs .
The idea behind this is to make it a true forum for conflict prevention and settlement and to encourage close collaboration between the activities of ACP and EU parliamentarians as election observers within the framework of EU election observation .
You should also know that in 2007 the Assembly met in Wiesbaden , and then in Kigali .
Nine resolutions were adopted .
The standing committees met four times : twice on the sidelines of the sessions and twice in between those sessions , in Brussels .
These committees , which are in charge of following up the resolutions , have since 2007 organised the hearing of the responsible committee members in the corresponding areas .
Apart from several reports , the Wiesbaden session adopted a resolution on the situation in Darfur .
There was a very constructive urgent debate on the situation in Zimbabwe .
The workshops on immigration , climate change and medicines for neglected diseases all attracted a great number of participants and great interest .
The Kigali session adopted three resolutions contained in the reports by the Standing Committees , Committees and two urgent resolutions on natural disasters in the ACP countries and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Mr President , Commissioner , there you have it . I have briefly summarised a formal report that I wanted to give a political content , in order to help explain and more effectively support the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you very much , but I can assure you that I am really enjoying it here and I know that my dear colleague regrets very much that he cannot be here for this discussion .
This exchange of views is very close to his heart , but I can assure you he is not wasting his time : he is travelling to an important meeting outside Brussels .
The Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique institution .
Mr Michel is my neighbour in the college meeting and this morning he explained everything to me about the functioning of the Assembly , so now I can claim to know a little bit about that .
He mentioned that the JPA is where the spirit of partnership that lies at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement can be witnessed directly , as 156 elected representatives from the European Union and from African , Caribbean and Pacific countries discuss together the core issues of their cooperation .
That is real North-South dialogue , a dialogue on the basis of equality and mutual respect , going beyond the traditional recipient-donor relationship .
That is the parliamentary embodiment of ownership and control .
Over the past years the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has become increasingly parliamentary in stature and in conduct , reflecting the maturity of the cooperation between the European Union and the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries .
Those debates are more open and regional conflicts less frequent .
That is indeed a worthwhile achievement .
The Assembly has indeed become a framework for an open political dialogue , showing itself capable of discussing issues of great sensitivity and major political relevance such as good governance , access to healthcare and the impact of foreign direct investment , the migration of skilled workers and the Economic Partnership Agreements .
The excellent report of Mr Hutchinson and the Committee on Development presents this evolution eloquently and on behalf of Mr Michel and myself I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work .
It presents the achievements and the challenges and explores the possibilities of future development .
One achievement was the leading role that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly played in the monitoring of the EPA negotiations , ensuring a two-way information flow thanks to the discussions with the chief negotiators and with my dear colleague Mr Michel on this matter during the year .
Another important leap has been the transmission by the Commission to the Assembly of the Country and Regional Strategy Papers .
That demonstrates the confidence in the capacity of the Assembly to play a more political role and provides an opportunity to show further signs of maturity .
In order to enhance parliamentary scrutiny , Commissioner Michel asked the Commission Delegations to transmit these strategy papers also to the Speakers of the national parliaments via the National Authorising Officer of the EDF in the beneficiary countries .
As you are aware , the Commission cannot transmit them directly since according to the Cotonou Agreement the NAO is our official contact point for all questions of programming and of EDF implementation .
At the same time , the JPA secretariat has also been transmitting these documents to the representatives of the respective countries in the JPA .
We thus have reason to believe that the national parliaments are informed and can take their part in the monitoring and control of development programmes .
It is true that the capacity of national parliaments to play their role fully in the preparation and execution of the EDF is often limited .
That is why the EDF finances institutional support in many ACP countries .
Beyond the scrutiny of Country Strategy Papers , the best way to ensure parliamentary control of EDF funds is to put in place general or sectoral budget support programmes .
In this way the external funds are completely integrated into the national budgetary procedure where national parliaments play a key role .
That is one of the reasons for the Commission 's decision to attribute about 45 % of the 10th EDF to budget support programmed in 44 countries , compared to just 25 at the start of the 9th EDF , so there is an upward trend .
Lastly , let me take this opportunity to add my congratulations to the Government and Parliament of Rwanda and to the German Presidency for their excellent organisation of last year 's Assembly sessions .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Hutchinson and congratulate him on his report , which is very good .
I share the rapporteur 's opinions , observations and satisfaction concerning such issues as the deeper involvement of members of the Assembly in its work , the quality of debates and the more relevant nature of these debates .
I agree that the greater involvement of non-governmental organisations in the work of the Assembly is a very positive phenomenon .
Meanwhile , I cannot remain silent about a couple of sadder aspects arising from observation of the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
I think it is a great shame that during the discussions , debates and negotiations on joint projects between the ACP side and representatives of the European Parliament , not all subject areas are tackled with an equally deep dialogue and desire to find a common position .
My impression is that the ACP side concentrates more on economic matters , devoting less attention and involvement to political matters .
In 2007 unusual enthusiasm and determination was displayed in discussions of an economic nature , primarily in negotiations relating to economic partnership agreements ( EPAs ) , and of course there is nothing wrong with that .
It is , however , hard to perceive an equally strong motivation to resolve difficult but important political problems .
Mr Hutchinson recalled that we had debated the situation in Zimbabwe , yet there was no resolution .
This trend of not adopting resolutions is still continuing , though .
This year we held a debate on Chad ; a compromise text of a resolution was adopted , but the resolution itself was thrown out by our ACP partners .
It seems to me that our goal should be to achieve more of a balance between economic and political goals .
I appreciate that it is sometimes easier to concentrate on economic matters , as they seem more significant and easier to develop politically .
Our European side should , however , concentrate on showing that there can be no continuing development without peace , stabilisation , human rights , the rule of law and better management .

Mr President , I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on his excellent report .
In 2007 we had confirmation of both the rise and relevance of the role of the JPA on the principal challenges of the North-South dialogue .
Regarding political crisis situations , for example , our urgent debates have allowed an in-depth constructive dialogue free from taboo on issues such as Haiti , Zimbabwe and Ethiopia .
The introduction of the JPA regional meetings , the first of which may have been in Namibia , I believe , will help to further deepen this political dialogue .
On the implementation of the EDF , Country and Regional Strategy Papers have been submitted to ACP governments since the end of 2007 .
The JPA must now adopt a strategy and a working method to guarantee the best follow-up and supervision of the use of these funds .
On the Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) , through its discussions and meetings with economic leaders and members of civil society , through its open political dialogue with our parliamentary colleagues in the South , the JPA made EPAs a political priority in 2007 .
The Kigali Declaration , which Mr Hutchinson mentioned earlier , is an illustration of this .
I am sorry that the European Parliament dismissed this declaration , despite it being negotiated and voted on unanimously by representatives of the various political groups there .
It would seem that , for some , a position adopted in Africa is sometimes harder to implement when we get back to Europe .
I am also sorry that the European Commission is ignoring the views of ACP MPs within the JPA and that it prefers a bulldozer approach by which it refuses to consider any renegotiation or reorientation of the EPAs .
The proposal for the creation of a new parliamentary body under the Caribbean agreement simply adds to the confusion .
Finally , I cannot get over the fact that in 2007 Official Development Assistance from the whole of the EU fell for the first time since 2000 .
It is my belief that in terms of international solidarity , what matters most is keeping our word , and several Member States - including mine - are not keeping theirs .
In 2008 , the JPA should vigilantly and resolutely continue the fight for EPAs , lobbying for a proper renegotiation of interim agreements - for those who want it - in accordance with the promise made by Commissioner Barroso , and for the 10th EDF , which is now entering its active implementation phase , but which risks seeing its appropriations diverted to finance EPAs .
The JPA is a unique forum and a unique tool for North-South dialogue .
It is an opportunity for fair , sustainable and joint development .
My colleague Mr Hutchinson has already said all of this , and I would like to congratulate him once more .

( ES ) Mr President , I will begin by congratulating Mr Hutchinson on clearly setting out in his report the work done by the Joint Parliamentary Assembly ( JPA ) in 2007 .
The Assembly is becoming the strongest pillar of cooperation between the European Union and the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries .
I would like to point out that it is the only international assembly that regularly brings together the elected representatives of various countries in order to promote North-South interdependence .
The JPA has led the way with economic partnership agreements , which are tools for the regional development and integration policy for the ACP countries and a means of progressively including them in the global economy in a sustainable way .
However , economic partnership agreements ( EPAs ) cannot be negotiated simply as free trade agreements .
My group insists on the possibility of renegotiating issues in these agreements such as services , intellectual property and the ' Singapore issues ' : investments , powers and public markets , as well as employment and social regulations and other issues relating to sustainable development .

( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my compliments to Mr Hutchinson on his work and on the report 's political approach , which I can endorse .
I welcome the choice of the path of dialogue and cooperation .
I would like to stress one point .
In order to respond to the needs of the people of the ACP countries and to achieve the ambitious millennium development goals , it is necessary for the negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) on a national and regional basis to be increasingly open to democratic participation and monitoring .
I therefore confirm that the commitments that we made in Kigali at the 14th session of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly are central to our actions .
I also welcome the reference to the need , when negotiating and applying the new agreements , to take into due account the protection and defence of democratic bodies and human rights .
Our efforts cannot and must not be reduced to mere economic aid .

( PL ) Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on an excellent report .
It seems to me important for us to look at the significance of contacts of this type between parliaments , between groups of parliaments and between the European Parliament and both the ACP countries and EuroLat in the context of world dialogue .
I feel that this is the form that should predominate in our contacts .
What is established between governments is of a rather different nature .
The dialogue that takes place between parliaments is a much broader dialogue ; it contains broader debates , and it seems to me that it better reflects the interests and concerns of the countries taking part in such dialogue , so this type of dialogue seems to me to be particularly valuable .
Also important are the political aspects that we would like to maintain , namely the matter of keeping the peace , the observance of human rights and the functioning of a civil society .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I have listened with great interest to the speeches that have been made by the honourable Members .
I do not think it is appropriate for the Commission to react to or interfere with your agenda and your priorities , so I shall not mention yet what the thoughts of our side are .
It is up to you .
On the issue of reopening negotiations , it must be quite clear that the interim agreements are the only way to preserve the trade flows after the deadline of 1 January 2008 , and they cannot be reopened .
However , the discussion , and hence the negotiation towards full EPA - regional and with full coverage - is ongoing .

Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your answers and comments .
I would just like to point out that effectively , the JPA is a matter for MPs , but that the Commission plays an important role , of course , in development policies at European level , and on that basis it is my wish that the Commission should not consider - and I think that Commissioner Michel , in any case , is included here - the work of this Assembly as anecdotal work , that it should not consider this Assembly as a sort of safety valve where the tensions between us are discussed , but rather that it takes into account the opinions expressed there , since for many of our ACP colleagues , this is unfortunately the only forum where they are able to express themselves .
In this respect , I would like to point out that so far you have observed that there has been no debate in ACP parliaments either on EPAs or Country Strategy Papers .
Even though we are supporting the people 's elected representatives - financing elections left right and centre , trying to export our democratic model - we do not have time to consult these elected parliaments , and some of your colleagues , as Mrs Carlotti said , are adopting a bulldozer approach to everything .
I hope therefore that the Commission can really take account of this work and recognise how excellent it is .
People have congratulated me on my report .
I would like to thank my colleagues , and I would also like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock , who is not here because as Co-President of the Assembly , she is in fact somewhere in the Caribbean .
I would like to congratulate her on the exceptional work that she does as Co-President of this Joint Assembly .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
A good relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries is very close to my heart and I am therefore delighted that the ACP / EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly continues to take on a more political form and quality .
In negotiations on the Economic Partnership Agreement and very generally in cooperation between the EU and ACP countries , subjects such as sustainable development , human rights , democracy and the creation of functioning constitutional systems must all definitely be on the agenda .
On no account should we disregard environmental protection and specifically the fight against climate change .
Even in the regions of the ACP countries , the effects of climate change could turn out to be disastrous .
The EU must set a good example here and meet the aims and obligations of 2007 .
Only then can we expect this from the ACP countries as well .
Another subject we definitely have to deal with is water .
Water shortage and drought are a major problem in the ACP countries , for which solutions have to be found so that there is no environmentally induced migration .
Competition : Sector inquiry on retail banking - Retail Financial Services in the Single Market ( debate )
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
by Gianni Pittella , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on Competition : Sector inquiry on retail banking
;
by Othmar Karas , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Green Paper on Retail Financial Services in the Single Market .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thanks to the careful investigative work carried out by the European Commission , we have been able to put the rigidity that is characteristic of retail banking services under the spotlight .
This investigative work is one to which we have dedicated ourselves , alongside Mr Karas , and so far it has enjoyed a very broad , and in fact nearly unanimous , consensus in the relevant committee .
I would therefore like to take the opportunity to express my particular thanks to Commissioner Kroes for the way in which she has always been available for debate with Parliament on this delicate matter .
The relationship between consumers and banks in Europe remains complicated because of the distortions that are a feature of the sector .
This relationship is , however , of fundamental importance and we ought to put it right by pointing out inadequacies and inefficiencies , identifying the main problems and possible approaches for solving them .
As my report and the report by Mr Karas state , actions of this type ought above all to be directed towards facilitating consumer mobility , so as to push the banks , indirectly , to operate at higher standards of efficiency .
That is why , in my report , I ask for it to be made simple and inexpensive for consumers to change banks .
Changing banks is still , in too many cases across Europe , a slow and difficult operation .
We are also opposed to any sort of contractual tie that is not clearly necessary , that prevents or hinders customer mobility .
We recommend that the European banking industry should improve the procedures for closing current accounts , and that only fully justifiable charges should be made , ensuring that this service takes place swiftly and that costs are not duplicated .
We also call on the Commission to act to ensure that the banks supply information of a better quality that is more easily accessible to consumers , through an information pack set out under cost headings , in a format that enables comparisons to be made easily .
I myself hold a current account at a bank , and when information packs arrive at my house I throw them away because they are not comprehensible ; the same goes for millions of citizens like me .
This can no longer be accepted .
Mrs Kroes , Mr McCreevy , if the banks do not make moves in line with these suggestions I call upon the European Commission to put forward a legislative proposal on this point .
I also ask for an assessment to be made of the feasibility of a European Internet search engine , enabling customers to compare the services offered by different bank sites .
We need to be able to click on a computer , access the Internet and have an IT platform that enables us to say : here is a better choice for me .
Today we do not have these options available .
On the other hand , ' interchange fees ' are another matter .
With regard to the position taken by the European Commission on this debate , I have made a proposal : that once and for all criteria should be given to the operators , by means of some kind of guideline , for establishing the method for calculating interchange fees , in such a way that the proper and transparent operation of the sector can be guaranteed .
I will end here , so as not to go over my four minutes .
I hope that with regard to these proposals , that I hope Parliament will adopt tomorrow morning , the Commission will provide an immediate follow-up , that is , at least , speedy and specific .

rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioners , Mr Pittella , first of all I should like to emphasise once again that the Commission proposals , Members ' aims and demands in the two reports and the effects of these reports on Europe 's citizens deserved a better time for debate and a bigger audience .
Secondly , with these reports and the debate with the Commission we are initiating the next stage in strengthening supply and demand in the financial services sector .
I should like to thank Mr Pittella , Mr Schmidt and Mrs Starkevičiūtfor their effective cooperation .
The broad majority in committee has shown that we have moved closer together yet have been making further demands .
What do we want ?
We want to continue developing the internal market for retail financial services and turn it into a domestic market for all consumers and small- and medium-sized enterprises .
I say this even though I know that the retail market is and will remain more of a local business than a global business .
Nevertheless , there is great potential , since only 1 % of EU consumers purchase cross-border financial services via distance communication methods , while this figure is at least 26 % inland .
There are - as the reports by the Commission and Parliament state - unjustified obstacles , despite differing responsibilities , which does not mean that in the past nothing would have happened .
I should like to point out that since 1988 , the liberalisation of the movement of capital within Europe has continued .
The introduction of the euro has brought benefits to the buying public and to the economy : the Financial Services Action Plan , the White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 and SEPA , the Single European Payment Area - consumers and suppliers benefit from this political development .
This is not the end , but we are moving purposefully along the path .
Both of the Commission 's reports - like ours too , perhaps - do of course have their weak points .
One of these can be found in the Green Paper where it talks almost exclusively of consumers .
This concerns the internal retail market as well as SMEs .
Furthermore , consumer protection measures alone are still not able to encourage any suppliers - and we know this - to go beyond the borders .
When you examine the sectors , the weak point without doubt is the fact that we draw only on a small amount of data .
We suspect a potential market foreclosure based on prices alone .
In our report we therefore ask the Commission to carry out a proper impact study , which must also include a component correctly ascertaining the original market conditions and assess the integration and competitiveness of the market and the impact of an initiative not just by means of one indicator but by the largest possible number of measurements .
We do , however , also support the Commission in its aim only to pursue initiatives that demonstrably offer citizens tangible benefits , are soundly justified by thorough cost-benefit analysis and have been subject to proper impact studies .
I could now highlight other weak points , but I should also like to limit myself to what we , too , have emphasised specifically in the reports .
An important message from this Parliament is that we clearly recognise the decentralised sector .
We need savings banks and cooperatives along with public limited companies .
We need cross-border local champions , not just global champions .
They are responsible for local service provision , economic development in the individual regions and security of supply .
The second point is that we need a balance between supply and demand .
Thirdly , we need harmonisation of the licensing and registration formalities .
Insurance companies and banks working across borders are subject to supervision by several financial authorities .
We should be harmonising here and creating equal entry requirements .
We should be expanding e-commerce .
Promoting the remote connection of businesses must drive forward the use of a safe electronic signature and there should be a reform of the Money Laundering Directive wherever it conflicts .
Further points are addressed : agents and brokers are important for greater competition in the financial services sector .
We need easier access to the credit data register and credit card registers and we need the block exemption regulation to be extended because we do not think cooperation distorts competition in this area if the conditions are clearly stipulated .
I am asking the Commission and my fellow Members to examine this report in its entirety and to adopt and support the other considerations - the 44 clarifications and measures in my report .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , it is a real pleasure for me to join you here today to talk about the Commission 's review of , and views on , the Pitella report .

But first let me congratulate both Mr Pitella and Mr Karas on a wonderful job and thank Parliament for its interest in this issue .
We share many views on this issue , and that is a good starting point .
Along with my dear colleague Charlie McCreevy and the Internal Market and Services DG , my services and I have put much effort into being students of retail banking and , like you , we are asking ourselves what could be improved .
It would of course be stupid to say that everything is perfect , so ' What could be better ? ' is our main line of approach to this issue .
In our sector inquiry the EUR 1 350 billion a year card-payment-systems market gained much of our attention .
That is not coffee money - EUR 1 350 billion on a yearly basis .
We also looked at improving credit registers , helpful and unhelpful cooperation between banks , and bank fees .
In response specifically to a key point in the Pittella report , I may conclude that we have many points of agreement and one point of difference .
On customer mobility : the ball is now in the industry 's court .
It needs to develop a code of conduct , and it may face legislation if it does not take this opportunity and this challenge .
On consumer information and transparency : price comparison and product disclosure information is critical for consumers .
But industry heavily contests suggestions for change so I fear that there might not be any progress .
My colleague Commissioner Kuneva is collecting evidence on retail banking fees as part of one of her Consumer Market Scoreboard follow-ups .
She will certainly be able to assess the diversity and transparency of banking fees and the corresponding level of consumer awareness .
This fact-gathering is the first step for change .
On credit registers I have good news .
The first meeting of the expert group on credit histories is planned in September 2008 , which is not long now .
Experts should present their recommendations to the Commission by 1 May 2009 .
Credit intermediaries , such as mortgage brokers , are a growth industry with many vulnerable customers , so the Commission 's study of them will be of great interest .
The results of that study are expected to be available in October 2008 .
Concerning cooperation between banks , the Competition DG is still doing further fact-finding for our sector inquiry , so it is too early for me to make detailed comments on this matter at this stage .
SEPA is still new , and competition is needed for it to function fully : I particularly agree with Parliament on this .
But I am confident it is working as well as we could expect at this point .
The area where there seems to be disagreement - as mentioned earlier - is the request to the Commission to issue guidelines on Multilateral Interchange Fees ( MIFs ) .
I have to be honest with you and say that I am not convinced that creating guidelines would be the right move at this stage and , based on our experience in this matter , I shall try to explain why .
The call for guidelines and ' clarity ' from the Commission - and I understand the question of the rapporteur and his team - is a predictable follow-on from our MasterCard case .
However , that decision - the MasterCard decision - was based solely on the specific facts of that case .
With only one case to base such guidelines on , we would risk making bad guidelines that undermine our efforts to help consumers ( that is again something we have in common : we - Parliament and the Commission - want to help consumers ) .
One case is not the basis of a magic solution .
Other reasons guidelines might not work are because there are payment card systems in the EU that operate with a MIF , and others without a MIF .
Decisions about a card scheme 's business model and financing mechanisms should be taken by the schemes themselves .
Obviously , the Commission cannot prescribe specific business models .
The assessment of the MIF of a developed system like MasterCard and the assessment of a MIF which new entrants in the market may wish to apply in order to start competing are not necessarily the same .
At this stage the Commission has only assessed the MIF in systems like Visa and MasterCard .
In the new framework laid down by Regulation ( EC ) No 1 / 2003 , it is the responsibility of the parties to assess the legality of their behaviour under EC competition rules .
A non-confidential version of the MasterCard decision is published on our website , so we are transparent and we are clear .
The Commission 's assessment of the MasterCard MIF can be used by other payment card systems as guidance , even if the assessment in the decision relates to MasterCard 's MIF and not to all possible MIFs .
But there is a suggestion I make to assist the market as this issue develops - that is a gesture from my side .
My services stand ready to further discuss with market participants and all stakeholders , and indeed they are already in close contact with the payment industry on this matter .
But allow me conclude in a positive way .
The Commission very much welcomes Parliament 's clear support for the need for measures to improve the level of efficiency and functioning of the retail banking sector , which remains fragmented along national lines .
I am committed to working with you to address the issue of the MIFs .
I hope that we can just conclude that the future is ours .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and in particular Mr Karas and Mr Schmidt , for their excellent work in producing a thorough and consistent report .


I wholeheartedly welcome your broad support for our strategy on retail financial services , as well as the significant contribution you have made towards deliberations on a wide range of issues .
It is not possible in the time allotted to provide our views on all of the issues covered in this extensive report .
I would therefore like to focus on two issues of particular importance in the retail area , our consideration of the framework for retail investment products , and our work on bank account mobility .
Turning first to retail investment products .
I am grateful for your support for our ongoing work to ensure that the regulatory framework for the sale of retail investment products delivers a consistently high level of investor protection .
I am convinced that competition between retail investment products can deliver real benefits for consumers .
However , we need to be confident that the sale of all investment products is accompanied by a high level of product disclosure and a point-of-sale discipline .
Only this will ensure that consumers are treated fairly and can take decisions on an informed basis .
I welcome the clear position you have taken in your report on these issues .
However , as you well know , I am not one to make decisions without first being fully convinced of the need for change .
Harmonisation or streamlining of disclosure and distribution rules would be a costly and disruptive process .
There may be objective reasons why some differentiation is needed between product types or distribution channels .
For these reasons , I believe it is far too early to conclude that there are deficiencies in existing investor protection regimes which call for new cross-cutting legislation .
Later this year I will come forward with a communication consolidating the evidence gathered in our research .
We will identify areas for further work , to examine , and address clearly , evidenced shortcomings in existing regulatory protections .
Turning now to bank account mobility .
Creating a competitive and efficient market for bank accounts is a core element in our retail financial services strategy .
Many consumers regularly face obstacles in trying to switch from one provider to another .
This situation cannot be allowed to continue and we are therefore pleased to receive your support on this point .
I welcome your call for the financial services industry to work towards the aims of the Green Paper by self-regulation and thus reduce the need for binding legal acts .
This reflects our commitment reiterated in the single market review to use , where appropriate or where they can deliver the desired outcome , self-regulatory measures rather than resort to legislation .
In this context , in November last year we invited the European banking industry to develop a European Code of Conduct by mid-2008 .
This code should contain a fully-fledged domestic switching service which should be made available to customers when they switch bank .
The banking industry does not need to start from scratch .
Rather , they should draw on existing best practices in some Member States .
Finally , delivery of a high quality code of conduct by the banking industry will be decisive in proving the merits of self-regulation .
Let me be clear today .
Should the code fail to meet the Commission 's expectations , alternatives , such as a legislative proposal , would have to be considered .

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( CS ) Mr President , I welcome the report by my colleague Mr Karas , which deals with a very important subject , namely easy access to banking services for all citizens and businesses in the European Union .
This will help to open up , or rather complete , our internal market .
However , I would like to draw your attention to the very serious problem of high banking fees in many Member States .
In some of these countries - and my own country , the Czech Republic , is one of the biggest culprits - these banking fees can be ridiculously high .
This really calls for foreign competition .
Only Poland fares worse than the Czech Republic .
On the other hand , banking is cheaper in the Netherlands or in Austria , for example .
The instruments that can rapidly change this situation ( and this also relates to the incredibly high fees for issuing credit cards ) are in the hands of the Commission and Parliament .
The elimination of obstacles to cross-border electronic banking would improve the situation for consumers and business customers , who would benefit from sound economic competition .
Apart from the need to reduce banking fees and make them more transparent , it will also be necessary to concentrate on enhancing the quality of banking services and improving the financial knowledge of consumers as well as small and medium-sized businesses .
Last but not least , the European Union will have to pay attention to the regulation of the so-called microcredit , which can give a significant boost to electronic ( through not only electronic ) trading .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is in our hands .
Mr President , Commissioner Kroes , Commissioner McCreevy , ladies and gentlemen , retail banking plays an essential role in the daily lives of families and of the vast majority of European businesses .
It is of great economic importance , generates around 2 % of the Community GDP , provides more than 3 million jobs and constitutes the largest banking sector , with gross revenue of more than 50 % of the EU total .
In order to grasp its importance we can consider that one of its characteristic services , mortgages , constitutes the main financial risk taken on by European citizens , with outstanding balances of around 50 % of the EU GDP , and that the volume of investment funds in the Member States is between 4 and 24 % of domestic economies .
Despite the progress in the regulation of the sector and the improvements brought about by the introduction of the euro , the integration of the Community financial services markets and the promotion of competition in the sector do not appear to have achieved their full potential .


Only 1 % of consumers in the European Union purchase cross-border financial services ; there are considerable variations in prices between entities ; the opportunities for choice are limited ; there are still structural barriers that make it difficult to provide services and for those services to operate properly between different countries .
The levels of profitability of retail banking vary widely , and establishments in the Nordic countries , Spain and Ireland are above average .
All of these issues are tackled in the reports in a reasonably balanced way .
I congratulate the rapporteurs , Mr Pittella and Mr Karas , and I would like to express my satisfaction at the ultimate inclusion of aspects such as the recognition of the role of retail banking in properly passing on monetary policy conditions to the market , the value that the plurality and diversity of models for trade with banks , cooperatives and savings banks brings to European retail banking , the existence of an environment of cooperation promoting competition between independent entities , the need for an appropriate framework for financial intermediaries and more comparability between financial products .
Improving the functioning of this banking sector will provide more efficiency , will help to develop the potential inherent in all the European regions and will facilitate access to financial services , along with greater compliance with the coverage terms for our citizens .
The main point of today 's debate is the question of what is to be done to ensure that EU citizens are able to make full use of the advantages offered by the single market in the financial sector , the latter being exceedingly fragmented .
How can we tackle this problem ?
There are three possible ways .
Firstly , by encouraging consumer mobility .
How can this be achieved ?
Firstly , information on all available products should be standardised and transparency in relation to the cost of these retail financial products ensured , thus enabling the consumer to choose by employing certain methods - perhaps , as Mr Pittella suggested , an Internet search engine .
We are not prepared to agree on the necessity of standardising all the products , as they should reflect social and cultural differences in the various countries .
Therefore , standardisation should be clearly defined .
In addition , we would enable consumers to open accounts in other countries .
Now we have the Schengen area , which allows everyone to move from country to country without any problems , data registering is no longer an issue .
However , banks have a problem with opening accounts for citizens of other countries .
I believe this is unacceptable in the age of modern technology .
I do not think these problems could be resolved simply through self-coordination , given the number of retail banks and the difficulties they encounter in coordinating their activities .
Can the Commission suggest any initiative in this direction ?
Another way would be to encourage the mobility of suppliers , enabling them to render their services via the Internet or by means of text messages .
At any rate , financial governance must be sorted out beforehand , clearly defining who is responsible for what in case something goes wrong .
I would like to finish by saying to Commissioner Kroes that we expect transparency from the Commission .
As regards payment card costs , new costs are currently being introduced , preceding your suggestion .
Consumers in the shops might not even be aware of increased costs , as the banks are in the process of adapting to new requirements .
Perhaps information on payment card costs should be publicised on a wider scale and more often , enabling consumers to compare them and be more empowered in dealing with the banks .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is certainly a will within Parliament to harmonise the European banking world .
I think , however , that families and small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly concerned , especially in my country , Italy , about certain practices which at the moment are undergoing tough and comprehensive scrutiny by the public .
I am talking , for example , about maximum overdraft fees and compound interest , which is interest on interest .
These are practices which have entered into conflict with the constitutional court and the court of cassation .
I do not understand , therefore , how people can talk of fee transparency or of clarity in the way in which fees are paid , when in a country such as Italy there are still such serious conflicts between banks and legal authorities .
The same goes for the flexibility of loans .
At the moment there is particular concern about the fact that thousands or hundreds of thousands of families are facing serious problems regarding loan flexibility .
I therefore think that Parliament ought above all to place the national banking world in line concerning fairer criteria .
( DE ) Mr President , both the Karas report and the Pittella report demonstrate that there is still a great deal to do for consumers in the sector of retail financial services such as bank accounts , loans and insurance .
Banks , whose market volumes are influenced by retail business by up to 50 % , are no longer interested in customer mobility and unfortunately only to a limited extent in transparent benchmarking .
Even this essentially good , but often wrongly interpreted relationship of trust between banks and their customers has less of a link and contributes less to customer mobility and the promotion of competition .
Competition can itself therefore be adjusted primarily by enlightened and well-informed customers .
In the end we have also included an EU budget line on financial market expertise in consumer and SME organisations . I simply wish to remind you of this .
In addition , consumer protection levels should not be impaired by the dismantling of barriers .
Moreover , the demand for collective legal aid in cross-border lawsuits relating to financial products agreed in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is the appropriate endorsement for fair market conditions .
In general , however , new financial products have to be introduced objectively and correctly .
The Commission is being asked to anchor regulatory requirements with regard to information , marketing and the organisation of comparable products for private customers in all the legal provisions of the financial market .
The principles of the MiFID Directive on best advice should also be made to apply particularly , for example , to unit-linked life insurance and other long-term savings products .
Helping the consumer , the customer , and thereby creating a flourishing market must be the principle by which we act .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to express my thanks to Mr Pitella and Mr Karas for their reports .
I share their conclusion permeating the entire report that every citizen in the European Union should have access to banking services .
Nevertheless , please allow me three comments .
Firstly , with regard to customer mobility , yes , it is our aim in a growing , fully functioning internal market to make sure that every customer also has cross-border access to banking services .
However , responsibilities are also bound up with this right .
I am therefore somewhat cautious when the demand is made here that in the event that a customer informs his bank that he wishes to switch to another we leave the risk , if he does not have his new bank account details in time , with the present bank .
This is not right !
Customers should assume responsibility for their own actions and must also assume this responsibility personally with the rights they have assumed .
We should not be toying with those who bail customers out whenever they are to blame for ending up in this dilemma .
Secondly , customer information .
I can but agree here with the previous speaker , Mr Ettl .
We still have to do this many times over in the case of comparable products in competition with each that do not have the same transparency because they are subject to different obligations to provide information .
This is not right !
I am very much in favour of customers obtaining information but it is also true here that we should not be throwing the baby out with the bath water and not inundating customers with too much information .
Customers need the necessary information to make responsible decisions themselves , but quality takes priority over quantity here .
Finally , back to the banking structures .
I agree with Mr Karas that we do in fact have different , historically developed banking structures in the individual Member States .
In one country there are only private banks , in others there are also savings banks , credit unions , state banks and more of the same .
It is not our job to reorganise the banking community .
The Member States should be doing this - if they are not already doing so .
Nor is it our job , however , to be carrying on traditions .
I think the market should decide whether the structures remain as they are or whether they should be changed .
Services , product ranges , services that individual market operators offer their customers - they should decide ; we should not be making decisions centrally .
Mr President , I just wish to comment briefly on some of the debate .
The issue about educating the consumer is very important .
We need consumers to understand financial services , and we need in particular to target young people who use credit cards like they were going out of fashion .
But let me just say that those of us who thought they were educated have been prone to the odd financial accident .
I mean , hands up those of us who fell for endowment mortgages ?
I should put both hands up in that regard .
Therefore , even with education and knowledge , mistakes are made and wrong products are sold to the consumer .
I am not sure how long the Commission is going to test out the codes of conduct before it legislates .
I am not a fan of legislation where none is required , but sometimes we need better legislation that is effective from a consumer point of view .
We have a credit crunch now and , where in the Irish banking system they were handing out money and 100 % mortgages were the norm , we now have quite the opposite with the curtailment of finance .
This is an issue that affects all of us and I hope that this debate contributes to better financial services for the European consumer .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I should like to thank the honourable Members once again for their work on this issue .
The point has been made that we need transparency and a clear overview of what is entailed for the consumer .
Quality is more important than quantity , but sometimes you need a bit of quantity to get the quality .
The Commission very much welcomes your clear support for the need for measures .
We are aware that we have to improve the level of efficiency , and that we have to improve the functioning of the retail banking sector , which remains fragmented along national lines .
That is not in line with the single market that we all believe in .
Therefore , the retail banking sector - which is an open door - is of key importance to all of us , to all the consumers and to the economy as a whole .
Parliament 's report reflects the importance which you too attach to this area .
Mrs Roithová talked about the situation in her country but mentioned that it was not only in her country that the high fees are often the result of a fragmented market with only a few players .
The situation we found in the sector inquiry report , which I have already touched upon , is quite clear .
We think , and we expect , that the introduction of SEPA will provide an answer to many of the problems , because it will facilitate cross-border competition , and that is what is needed .
It is a pro-market approach and it should work .
We are , therefore , very much behind this initiative and are working with the industry to help SEPA reach its goals .
Mr Sánchez Presedo rightly said that promoting competition is key to this whole approach , because if there is no competition then we are all aware that the banks are trying to pull our legs .
On the actual cost of payment cards , which Mrs Starkevičiūtasked about , we share the honourable Member 's wish for more transparency in the market .
Pro-competition means that we should be aware of what is going on in the market , and the fact that it was not clear why consumers benefited from this was one of the reasons for prohibiting MasterCard 's interchange fees - that was clear-cut .
Our aim is to see fees which have clear and verifiable benefits to consumers .
Mr Klinz rightly talked about rights , and these are always combined with responsibilities : not only of the customers but also of all of us - the banks and all the players in the game .
We need more transparency , we need to be clear what we are picking out .
The changes to the market are hopefully leading in that direction .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , as I remarked earlier , the reports are excellent pieces of work .
They are thorough and consistent and will provide a significant contribution to our ongoing work on retail and financial services .
I appreciate that some people might wish us to move faster on some of the initiatives , but speed does not always equate to equality .
We are committed to our better regulation principles , including thorough impact assessments .
Some of our initiatives , such as bank accounts , have been underway for several years and should bear fruit this year .
Others , such as our work on retail investment projects , are a little newer and will require more research before we can reach any firm conclusions .
Mrs Roithová referred to bank changes and my colleague Neelie Kroes has dealt with that issue .
I would just like to point out that we cannot regulate charges as such , but what we really need is real competition and the ability of consumers to easily switch from providers with which they are dissatisfied .
Of course we want to make it easier for them to switch and to have a variety of players in the marketplace .
That in itself will bring down prices .
Mrs Margarita Starkevičiūtraised a number of issues .
I have noted all her suggestions and we will act on them as far as possible .
Mr Ettl spoke about the retail banks .
The Green Paper that we published precisely addresses some of these real concerns .
I usually agree with my friend Mr Wolf Klinz but , unless I misunderstood , I detected that he was not so anxious about the switching of bank accounts .
What we are trying to do is allow consumers to switch bank accounts easily within Member States .
I would just point out that it not rocket science .
Other Member States have embarked upon codes of conduct and have done it quite easily .
We have given the banking industry an opportunity to self-regulate in this particular area .
I have met some of them .
Some come up with all kinds of wonderful and wondrous excuses about why it cannot be done , but I can assure them that it is not astrophysics that we are dealing with .
It is quite simple to operate and is an opportunity for them to prove that self-regulation is the better way .
But , as I said in my earlier remarks , if we do not do this , there are other alternatives available to us .
However , I do agree with Mr Klinz 's second point about the bank structures in various Member States .
These are entirely for each Member State to organise , and there are different banking structures in all of the Member States .
A Member State itself can organise its structures in any way it wishes , but if it enters into the free market area , it must abide by the rules of the Treaty , and this could sometimes lead to conflict .
However , the organisation of the banking structure in a Member State is solely a matter for the Member State concerned .
I agree with Mrs McGuinness regarding the operation of codes of conduct .
She referred to the great phase of endowment mortgages .
I was a little reluctant ever to go down that road myself and resisted it for years , but at one time , with another person , I allowed myself to avail of one of those .
I was one of the lucky ones .
I turned out at the end of the period of time with a profit , which was a surprise to me and to everybody else , given my earlier reluctance in that area .
However , I do not think that anybody could be blamed for the way endowment mortgages went .
It was the fashion of the time .
Everybody believed in doing it this particular way , and there was a fair amount of aggressive selling .
But I think that , as long as the consumer is aware of many of the pitfalls , that is what codes of conduct or any type of consumer protection should do .
I always say to people in business , whether they be in big or small businesses - and we should be aware as consumers - if a thing looks too good , it is too good .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would quickly like to thank all the Members who have spoken , and thanks once again to the Commissioners and to Mr Karas .

I would like to say a swift word on interchange fees .
My proposal for guidelines is based on the conviction - and of course here we may disagree , Mrs Kroes - that the interchange fee is useful for the development and the efficiency of the payment instrument .
Also , in the absence of interchange fees there is a risk that the costs would be borne by consumers .
Moving on to the issue of what is the best approach on the regulation of financial markets , I believe - and I have often said so to Commissioner McCreevy - that under-regulated and poorly regulated financial markets and the frequently ineffectual self-regulation carried out by the banking industry are elements whose negatives effects have been clearly demonstrated by the current financial crisis .
I therefore believe that it would be wrong to think that the proper integration of the retail financial sector can be completed solely by means of self-regulation by the industry .
The retail products financial market will only be able to call itself properly integrated once that degree of full harmonisation that the consumer protection rules aim to bring about has been achieved and guaranteed .
This can best be done through a legislative initiative by the Commission .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to reiterate the thanks I expressed at the outset to all those involved , and to ask the Commission to include Parliament 's proposals in full in its legislative deliberations .
The second point is a tip . I should like to point out to my fellow Members that the report on consumer education - we have spoken a great deal about this today - in the financial services sector is being debated in the House and will be discussed in plenary in the autumn .
Another point is that we should not forget that the different tax systems of the Member States are a major obstacle to the provision of cross-border financial services and that this also creates low interoperability , particularly where financial products are promoted for tax purposes .
I also wish to appeal to the industry and the banks to carry out self-regulation in order to do the preliminary work for the objective of this Green Paper .
On the issue of standardisation and product diversity , we also have to say yes to standardisation as long as it does not jeopardise product diversity .
As regards bank charges , which Mrs Roithová has addressed , the Commission has already referred to SEPA .
However , we also have many other obstacles , namely the obstacle that rights earned in one country often cannot be transferred to another country and the obstacle that an account can be opened if the domicile is given .
Then there is the missing definition of e-commerce : cross-border money transfers are working , but there are barriers when opening an account and to other rights , which we must remove .
We have enough work to do to get proposals onto the table .
We should be seeing results and continuing to work consistently .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( SK ) A well-functioning integrated financial market is a necessary precondition for the realisation of the Lisbon agenda .
Banks play an essential role in passing on monetary policy conditions , particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers .
Although many clients would be interested in using cross-border financial services , opening an account in a Member State bank is accompanied by so much bureaucracy that clients often get discouraged .
The European banking industry should improve and simplify its account closing procedures .
Statements of account are still very complicated and many consumers do not understand them .
The complexity of financial products makes it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions .
Consumers are also burdened with disproportionately high banking fees for services and for the issue of credit cards .
I think that rather than regulating banking fees , the EU should ensure that the banking sector is competitive .
Informed consumers are an essential component of economic competition among banks .
I believe that consumer organisations play an important role because they are able to define which information they deem to be necessary to enable consumers to make appropriate choices when it comes to banking products .
They can coordinate financial education programmes aimed at increasing the awareness of consumers as regards their money management options .
They also help very vulnerable consumers .
I believe that the time will come in the EU when consumer organisations will not be fighting for their survival .
Once they become responsible for consumer policy , they will understand how important finances are .
in writing . - The Commission offers three strategies in the Green Paper on retail financial services to promote integration of the retail markets in financial services - lower prices and more choice , empowering consumers and enhancing consumer protection .
Firstly , I would like to focus on consumer empowerment and I would like to highlight the need to raise the level of financial literacy .
At the recent consumer financial education hearing we saw a number of practical examples of consumer financial education programmes .
Further efforts could be made to share best practices in this area across the Member States , bearing in mind the new Member States in particular .
Regarding consumer choice , it is clear that consumers who wish to change financial services providers must be able to do so with a minimum of costs and legal barriers .
As regards information given to the consumer , it is not enough to provide consumers with as much information as possible .
Overloading the consumer with information will have the opposite effect .
Nonetheless , sufficient information which helps the consumer to make informed choices has to be provided .
Pursuant to the Pittella report , the sector audit analysed the competition situation regarding payment systems , including card systems , credit offices , cooperation between banks and price and bank settlement policies .
The audit shows that there are significant differences between the commission paid for bank cards .
Thus , it was detected that the majority of national debit cards networks settle inter-bank commissions on a significantly lower level than the international networks , and that , in most of the Member States , the majority of banks permit the grant of mortgage credits , of personal credits and of loans to SMEs with the opening of a current account .
Usually , the client does not have the same negotiation power when initiating the contractual relation with the bank where he becomes a client .
The client signs a contract that he does not always read and even if he does , he would like to suggest changes , which is not possible .
From this viewpoint , I consider that the competent regulation authorities should supervise the form of the contracts offered by the banks so as to protect the interests of both the clients and the bank .
I consider that it is compulsory that a client who opens an account to previously receive a brief presentation of the applicable costs for the entire period of its utilization .
Community system against illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing ( debate )
The next item is the report by Marie-Hélène Aubert , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent , deter and eliminate illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing - C6-0454 / 2007 - .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all allow me to thank the rapporteur for her work on this report .
I am pleased to note the strong support of the Committee on Fisheries on this important proposal to prevent , deter and eliminate IUU fishing .
As you know , IUU fishing constitutes a major threat to the sustainability of fish stocks and marine biodiversity , which undermines the very essence of the Common Fisheries Policy .
I do not believe that it is necessary to expand any further on the disastrous global environmental and economic consequences of IUU fishing , as you are well aware of that .
However , it is important to bear in mind that IUU fishing is a worldwide phenomenon , affecting in particular developing countries .
This is why the proposal is a non-discriminatory instrument , applying to all Community trade of fishery products deriving from IUU fishing , in all waters , and to all Community nationals engaging in or supporting IUU fishing activities conducted under any flag .
International cooperation is the key to the efficient elimination of IUU fishing .
This is why the Commission has already commenced bilateral contacts with third countries .
The Commission has also defined a working programme , in close cooperation with the Development DG and EuropeAid , to support developing countries , in order to assist them with a smooth and successful implementation of the regulation , in particular with regard to the catch certification scheme .
This working programme includes seminars and workshops in a large number of third countries .
The Commission can agree with nearly all amendments proposed , which are either covered by the proposal or which are incorporated in the Presidency compromise text .
I am extremely happy that the report supports , in particular , the implementation of the regulation to all vessels , its catch certification scheme and the harmonisation of sanctions .
The inclusion of Community vessels is an important feature which will ensure non-discrimination and consistency with WTO rules .
It is also important that the Community demonstrates its seriousness in fighting IUU fishing activities , by including all vessels infringing conservation and management rules .
The catch certification scheme is the instrument which will ensure the control of traceability of fishery products .
Inspired by current practices in Regional Fisheries Management Organisations and customs regulations , it must apply to all fishery products , including processed products , in order to be efficient .
Aquaculture products and products with marginal Community trade will , however , be excluded from its scope .
We can do this during final negotiations in Council .
Harmonised sanctions will strengthen the ability of Member States to take measures to prevent IUU activities and to ensure that any economic advantage will be more than offset by the fines imposed .
The Commission strongly believes that a system of dissuasive , proportionate and harmonised sanctions and accompanying measures is the key to compliance with the regulation .
I would once again like to thank Mrs Aubert for the report and the committee for its attention on this very important issue .
This report is a significant contribution to a truly efficient fight against IUU fishing .
Madam President , the events unfolding this very day in Brussels show us to what extent the future of European fisheries is under threat if the European Union is incapable of implementing the sustainable management of fish stocks and root-and-branch reform of its existing policies .
The fight against IUU fishing is a major element of this more demanding and coherent policy .
However , the globalisation of trade , the free movement of capital , and advances in transport and communication have all led to a significant increase in illegal fishing over recent years .
Today the situation is no longer tenable . European fishermen , like all stakeholders , including NGOs , are unanimously calling for this phenomenon - which hastens the destruction of resources and results in unfair competition for those who play by the rules - to be tackled more effectively .
However , that is not to say that Member States have not been able to monitor and sanction illegal practices , as they should have done .
In this respect , the report of the Court of Auditors published a few months ago is damning .
This is why the European Commission 's ambitious proposal announced last October was particularly well received by the Committee on Fisheries , which had already adopted , by an overwhelming majority , an own-initiative report on the EU 's February 2007 action plan to combat IUU fishing .
In fact , we are delighted that the Commission 's legislative proposal incorporates most of our recommendations .
These include the publication of an IUU vessels list ; reinforced port state controls ; compulsory catch certificates for the flag state and therefore the refusal to import fisheries products obtained from IUU fishing into the EU ; reinforced and harmonised sanctions , and a Community alert system .
Therefore , there is not much missing from the Commission 's proposal .
However , as you know , three points have been the subject of a heated debate within the Council , particularly concerning the scope of the regulation .
For my part , I am delighted that we have finally managed to secure the scope that you have proposed , which extends to both Community and third-country vessels .
The catch certificate has also been considered too cumbersome or complex , and the level and nature of the sanctions have also been fiercely debated .
These issues were also raised within our committee .
However , our amendments have , I think , finally helped to clarify the text while preserving the ambition and major goals of the new regulation .
The report was adopted by unanimous vote and I would like to thank my colleagues for their support , which helped to secure this outcome .
With a sector in crisis , the European Parliament wants to send out a very strong signal today , aimed particularly at the Council , which has been too slow to shoulder its responsibilities in this area .
Commissioner , the fight against IUU fishing is still only part of the wider policy including the Control Regulation and that of serious offences .
This divide has not helped to clarify the proceedings , to say the least .
We are still waiting for clarification from you on how these three new regulations are to be structured .
Similarly , concerns over the complexity of the catch certificate are just an excuse to dilute or postpone the text .
We need universally comprehensible procedures which can be operated by a sufficient number of reliable , efficient and competent staff , and are accessible to developing countries , who in any case are the main victims of IUU fishing .
On this too we expect clarification and a commitment from you .
Finally , we are counting , Commissioner , on your resolve - which we know is considerable - to put a swift end to illegal fishing , which affects bluefin tuna and cod most of all , highly prized species which are heavily overfished at present .
This at least would give a concrete response to the serious problems currently faced by the fishing industry .
There is still a great deal of work to be done , as you know , to ensure a sustainable future for European fisheries .
However , an important step will be taken in the coming weeks , and I am as pleased about this as you are .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this debate is taking place during the most serious crisis in the Community fisheries sector that we have ever known .
There are various reasons why costs are not being covered in the sector and why it is currently not profitable to go out fishing .
Fish imports and the entry of illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing into the European Union are among those reasons .
We therefore support the proposal and the report , but they are not sufficient .
I would like to take this opportunity to speak out in the European Parliament to ask the Commission and the Council to do something urgently , and not to allow this sector to die , as if it continues as it is now , it is going to collapse .
I ask the Commissioner and the Council to prepare and adopt a joint urgent emergency plan that also includes medium and long-term measures .
France is leading this battle , and the imminent French Presidency is a golden opportunity to make it happen .
The Commission needs to exercise its right of initiative more actively - with aid , compensation , restructuring , innovations - in order to mitigate the costs that the sector is suffering from and curb unfair competition in imports .
Time is running out .
We wanted the Committee on International Trade to be part of this debate , because there is little point in banning IUU fishing if the European Union then opens its markets to it .
Is it too much to ask for only legal fish to be sold in the European Union ?
We need more controls , more traceability and more and better labelling , in short more guarantees of what is entering the European Union .
This needs to be done not only by the European Union but globally , through multilateral and bilateral channels .
Partnership agreements should also be a tool for achieving this , with the corresponding technical assistance and training , in order to create not new barriers to trade , but rather measures that are effective for all the parties involved .
On this rests the future of a whole economic sector , which in the European Union is very concentrated in regions that are highly dependent on it , and therefore it has huge social repercussions .
On this also rests the sustainability of fisheries resources , which are a prime source of healthy food , at a time when there is a food crisis .
Madam President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , let me thank Mrs Aubert for her report .
Illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing is one of the main problems in the sector , for , most importantly , it greatly damages the environment , and this is a major problem for the planet .
It distorts competition . Those who carry out illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing are in a more advantageous position than legal fishing operators , whom it is our duty to protect .
Unreported fishing means a loss of revenue for the state .
One of the measures set out in the proposal for a regulation that we are voting on is the creation of a scheme of port state control that would prohibit access by third country vessels involved in illegal fishing activities .
The proposal provides for a ban on the importation of fish from illegal fishing ; the creation of a list of vessels that are involved in illegal and unreported fishing ; the development of a Community Alert System when there is a suspicion that fish from illegal fishing have been detected ; and a prohibition on importing fish from countries that have been identified as not cooperating with the EU scheme .
There are some controversial points in the regulation , such as its scope of application .
Some Member States are calling for it to be limited to the fisheries responsibilities of Community vessels outside Community waters , since there are already plenty of provisions to control fishing within Community waters .
In addition , the revision of the basic regulation on the control of fishing is expected by the end of 2008 .
I believe that there will be duplication between the two regulations and that they will not facilitate the process of simplifying the common fisheries policy .
In conclusion , let me say that this is indeed a serious subject and we should treat it as such .
We must tackle it with discipline and determination , and always in cooperation with the fishermen , whose opinions and cooperation we crave .
In any event , we support Mrs Aubert 's report and thank her for her work .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Aubert report on illegal fishing was unanimously adopted in the Committee on Fisheries , as the rapporteur , whom I congratulate , has already mentioned .
This alone probably sheds more light on the subject than anything I can say at this juncture .
However , one can never repeat enough that illegal fishing is a crime against nature and against the economy , one that unfortunately often goes unpunished and against which we have to act with determination and courage .
I therefore would like to thank Commissioner Borg and the Commission for the timely way in which they reacted to the concerns voiced by Parliament in February 2007 , putting forward a proposal for a regulation that exceeded all expectations and that rightly deserves our applause .
Nevertheless , however improved the regulatory framework may be , without the Member States ' commitment and sufficient human resources and materials being made available , success will not come easily in a battle where progress is hampered by extremely difficult conditions .
This is why we need to get the Member States on board too .
In any event , with this report and the subsequent regulation , the European Union is taking a very important step and sets an example that ennobles us and fills us with pride .
I am sure that the Commission will continue to welcome Parliament 's contributions with a view to improving its proposal still further .
Madam President , Commissioner , I apologise if I am now breaking with protocol , but I cannot pass up this opportunity to make a passionate plea .
The fisheries sector is going through very difficult times due to fuel price increases .
Everyone is suffering at the moment , but the most vulnerable especially so .
I know that several Member States , including my own country , Portugal , intend to ask you , or have already done so , for your support to find solutions within the European framework , namely by using the European Fisheries Fund flexibly to adopt measures that may attenuate the social effects of the current crisis .
I know that it is not needed , but let me appeal for your solidarity and the spirit of openness that you have always shown towards the sector 's problems , to help find a satisfactory solution as quickly as possible .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , the ALDE Group wishes to express its full support for Mrs Aubert 's excellent report .
The amendments it proposes clarify and , in some cases , develop various aspects of the Commission 's proposal , including some useful additions on force majeure subsidies and sanctions .
The emphasis placed on the need for non-discrimination in application of the regulation too is particularly welcome , for there is no doubt that IUU fishing is something that needs to be tackled on a global basis and the EU measures are an important step in that direction .
Last week I was fortunate to be on a delegation from the Committee on Fisheries to Norway .
We were told that in the last three years , and particularly since the introduction of a port state control scheme for the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in May 2007 , there has been a huge reduction in IUU fishing in the area .
That scheme covers all EU Member States , as well as Norway , Iceland , the Faroe Islands and Russia .
Indeed , Norway 's Minister for Fisheries and Coastal Affairs spoke highly of the EU 's cooperation in this regard .
But there is agreement too that localised measures can have the effect of displacing the problem rather than resolving it .
That is why it is especially good to see Amendments 5 , 6 and 54 , which seek to do more to minimise any negative impacts on developing countries .
I would add , too , that I believe we have a special responsibility to assist in the improvement of inspection and control systems in developing countries and to do so not only in the cases of those countries with which we have fisheries partnership agreements .
Further , I hope that the Commission , Parliament and the Council alike will be active in promoting the adoption of a binding convention on port state control at United Nations level .
Preparation has already begun in the FAO and , with the right will , could be adopted in March 2009 .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , I should like to thank my group colleague , Marie-Hélène Aubert for the amount of work she has put in successfully to this report .
It is obviously in the interests of all fishing nations and fishing communities to eliminate illegal fisheries .
After all , it is the fishing communities themselves who will benefit from the successful conservation of the resource .
International cooperation is essential in successfully eliminating illegal fishing by the pirates and organised criminals worldwide who operate in the field .
Within the common fisheries policy too much attention has been paid to the recent report of the Court of Auditors on control and enforcement .
That report was based on data supposedly gathered from the six most important fishing Member States .
However , that data that the Member States listed included the UK ( England and Wales ) .
Scotland has some 70 % of the UK 's fisheries and was not included in that data .
I would just like to make the point that there are distinct and separate quota and management and enforcement organisations within Scotland .
We have made some progress in my fishing nation too in recent years on improving controls .
We have the registration of buyers and sellers and we have designated ports of landing .
Good enforcement is , of course , important , but equally important is a sensible management regime which provides incentives to conserve by guaranteeing that Scotland 's fishermen , for example , are guaranteed to benefit in the long term from the conservation measures that they have to apply from time to time .
The CFP has simply not provided that kind of guarantee .
I was glad to hear you , Commissioner Borg , say recently that you favour root-and-branch reform of the CFP . I agree .
I say : let us return day-to-day management and control of the resource to the fishing nations themselves , who have fishing entitlements in logical fishing areas such as the North Sea , and let us abandon the unworkable notion that we can have equal access to waters and resources .
Notwithstanding some aspects on which we have reservations , we welcome the initiative to prevent , deter and eliminate illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing and we agree with the general thrust of the report .
Among other points , we stress the importance of the rules outlined in this initiative being applied to all vessels , whether from EU countries or from third countries .
However , we would like to point out that making these proposals tally with a review of Community rules on control in the future must safeguard the competences of the Member States , namely in terms of procedures and carrying out inspections .
Furthermore , we also believe that the whole gamut of questions regarding sanctions falls within the competence of each Member State .
Lastly , I should just like to emphasise that if the Commission could be as quick to respond to the sector 's just claims as it has been with this initiative , then the sector would not be faced with the constant worsening of its socio-economic situation .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( SV ) Madam President , the Regulation being discussed today is both wide-ranging and complex , and I just want to emphasise a few points .
Firstly , the proposal that fishermen caught fishing illegally should repay the subsidies they have received from the EU is a very good one .
We cannot allow a situation in which taxpayers are forced to subsidise criminal activity .
On the other hand , illegal fishing is carried on by all types of boats .
The proposal should therefore cover all vessels , both EU vessels and third-country vessels .
Secondly , the proposed catch certificate is positive .
The certification process has a key role to play in combating illegal fishing .
However , I have more misgivings about common maximum fines .
The Member States should be allowed to act on their own responsibility by imposing deterrent charges .
Finally , I think that the common European fisheries policy has proved to be a failure and must be reformed .
In order really to combat illegal fishing we need to cooperate internationally , both with regional fishing organisations and with other international bodies .
Madam President , illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing is indeed something to be stamped out .
There is much , therefore , in this report with which I agree , but I do have to reject its attack on subsidiarity by demanding that the EU should be setting the criminal sanctions and the establishment of an EU core of inspectors .
Likewise , I oppose the unnecessary additional bureaucracy of applying the regulation to EU-flagged vessels , because these are already subject to the stiff provisions of the common fisheries policy .
We do not need more regulation on our own fishermen to deal with third countries which continue with their rogue activities .
Having seen in recent months some punitive fines on local fishermen in the United Kingdom , I for one reject the suggestion that we need more and stiffer regulations and penalties on our own fleets .
( ES ) Madam President , I would like to thank Mrs Aubert for her report .
I think that it clearly expresses Parliament 's political will to support whatever actions are necessary to eradicate illegal fishing in all contexts , and , starting with the context that affects us , to close the Community to imports of and trade in illegal fisheries products .
We cannot , however , get around the responsibility that falls to the port State and the Commission itself under this proposal .
We are talking about a regulation that is very ambitious in its wording , which will compel the Member States to be extremely vigilant and not to spare any material or human resources - one of the weak points of the whole control policy - to turn words into deeds .
Unfortunately , this means once again that we need to bring other political wills into play in addition to our own .
The damage that illegal fishing causes , not only to biological resources , but also to legal fishermen , has been considerable every day for years .
Currently a large proportion of the sector is in a state of revolt in response to another massive drop in profitability , one of the most serious causes of which is of course the rise in diesel prices .
There are , however , other factors that are adding to the losses , and among these the mass entry of imports at low prices and of dubious origin across our borders is , under these circumstances , especially scandalous .
By way of example : in the last five months of this year alone , in Spain the price of diesel has risen by 38 % , while the price of swordfish , which is an imported species par excellence , has dropped by 40 % .
There is no business in any sector that can survive this type of economic context , but nevertheless it is a proven fact that , when there has been the political will to monitor imports closely , as has occurred in the past - and I can bear witness to this - the prices paid to Community producers have immediately recovered .
Commissioner , I therefore ask you and the Member States to be firm in implementing this regulation with the utmost possible urgency .
( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate her on her first-rate work in this report .
As the European Union , we must finally realise that the more we allow this uncontrolled situation to develop , the more we are mortgaging the future of marine fishing and the global marine ecosystem .
The EU should move forward immediately , acting not only as a union of regulations that are bureaucratic , complex and often not even implemented by its Member States , but should take a global initiative without being afraid of the major interests at stake or succumbing to international or other pressures .
Thus the entire global community involved in fishing will be able to understand , accept and finally agree on the minimisation of illegal and unreported fishing .
A prerequisite for such an initiative will , of course , be a globally accepted agreement on the maintenance of fisheries .
I too should like to express my concern along with all my fellow MEPs on the major crisis being experienced by European fishermen .
Commissioner , we must immediately examine these issues and deal with the problems .
( PL ) Madam President , the Council regulation is an interesting example of preventive legislation , of a regulation directed against illegal catches , a practice that threatens the maintenance of a sustainable level of fish stocks .
The clarity of the proposed solutions is the main reason why this particular document has a chance of being effective - a precise definition of the legislator 's intentions .
The rapporteur has excellently grasped the specific nature of the regulation , providing unusually helpful interpretations that simply make it easier to decipher the most important provisions .
Governments of countries of the southern and eastern Baltic have responded extensively to this important legal initiative .
In expert circles , though , arguments about the criteria the Council has suggested for punishing fishermen who take illegal catches are still continuing .
The question arises once more : does the idea of seeking a guarantee of effective punishment through its far-reaching formalisation take account of the differentiation in the catch potential of the European seas ?
Should subsequent legislation not bear in mind the possibility of making the penalty level dependent on the fish stocks and binding catch quotas for species caught ?
I believe that the recently declared modified ICS evaluation in respect of the Baltic ecosystem constitutes an announcement of a thaw in fisheries policy , in the process of adjustment of the revolutionary actions of the European Union aimed at protecting stocks .
The European Parliament Committee on Fisheries had the foresight to complete a special amendment document that treats the first year of application of the regulation as a transition period , a period of adaptation , enabling Member States to take the necessary steps to come into line .
Madam President , the world 's fisheries are in crisis .
The EU 's fisheries are in crisis , compounded by a 30 % increase in marine fuel prices in recent months .
The fishermen are on our streets in Brussels and in our Member States .
Your response , Commissioner , is urgently awaited .
Moving now from unsustainable economic pressure to unsustainable environmental pressure , experts report that 75 % of fisheries are significantly depleted and over-exploited .
Illegal unreported unregulated fishing is a global problem that compounds the present fisheries crisis .
According to the FAO , overall IUU fishing accounts for up to 30 % of total captures of some important fisheries , and catches of particular species could be up to three times the permitted amount .
IUU fishing undermines sustainable fisheries , harms and destroys marine habitats and threatens the livelihood of responsible fishermen and communities depending on fishing .
Illegal fishing also jeopardises food security , particularly for those heavily dependent on fish as a source of animal protein .
By-catch , due mainly to large-scale industrial bottom-trawling , often carried out unregulated , illegally and unreported by distant fishing fleets , has devastating effects on local fishermen and fish stocks .
Over one third of the world 's catch is simply discarded due to inappropriate fish sizes or simply due to unintended catch .
Misguided EU fishery regulations have encouraged completely unsustainable practices , such as discarding on a massive scale , as it is - perversely - illegal to land by-catches , the examination of which would be invaluable to the scientists .
The extreme vulnerability of most deep sea fish stocks to rapid depletion means that this fishery may no longer exist by the time regulations are implemented .
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether he has looked at the possibilities for satellite tracking of vessels , electronic documentation systems for catches and on-board CCTV as possible measures to combat illegal fishing , as happens in other jurisdictions .
Proper implementation of this regulation will require a high degree of integration at Community level of the services responsible for inspection and control .
It will also require fishermen and other stakeholders to take responsibility and ownership of the policy .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union has a duty and responsibility to play a significant role in combating illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing and it is doing so with a package of enforcement initiatives , strengthening controls , inspections and sanctions .
The most ambitious objective , however , is preventive in nature : enabling and guaranteeing the traceability of products from catch to final destination .
This is because , while the damage caused by such illegal activities in economic terms and in terms of protecting the marine environment is serious , the objectives to be achieved for consumer protection with a high-quality product and to safeguard fishermen 's occupations are no less important .
These occupations are more than ever at risk because of many factors , some of which are economic , but some of which are structural .
It is these important social objectives that guide the European Union in preventing , discouraging and eliminating illegal fishing , which is the subject of this regulation , and which reinforce its commitment to ensure compliance with the provisions of the common fisheries policy in Community waters .
The unanimous vote in favour of the Aubert report in committee is an important signal of the will to put the proposed measures into practice .
( BG ) Mme President , Members of the European Parliament , This report touches upon very important issues related to the protection of seas and the measures to combat illegal fishing .
The need for change of the existing legal framework results from the increasing scope of this phenomenon which threatens ecosystems and fisheries in the Community .
The rapporteur notes also the essential fact that Member States fail to follow the common fishing policy .
Existing sanctions vary from one Member State to another , which discriminates some fishermen in the European Union .
Therefore it is very important to improve the cooperation , coordination , and exchange of good practices among the European countries so that to prevent and deter illegal and unreported fishing .
The establishment of a control system geared to the needs of the fishing sector is a substantial step forward .
As well as damage to the environment , illegal fishing causes economic and social consequences that make legal fisheries suffer losses in the amount of billions of Euro .
The ban on the importation of fish products of illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing into the European Union , too , can affect the profits from illegal fishing .
The control policy and the serious sanctions for violations provide grounds for better management of fish resources .
Fishermen protest in Bulgaria , too , as they go through many difficulties .
Therefore we need to make responsible decisions on the future of the sector .
I support the report of Mme Aubert .
Madam President , I should like to thank Mrs Aubert for this report .
The one issue that needs to be stressed is the consumers ' lack of awareness of the problem of unregulated , unreported and illegal fishing and that is something we need to speak more about .
As others have said , the legal fishing sector is under severe threat and the impact of this illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing is just part of the problem .
Fuel costs are a major issue for them and we need some response from the Commission to the crisis which has seen fishermen give away fish in Member States and take to the streets in protest .
Perhaps part of the problem we have with the illegal side of the fishing is over-regulation on the legal sector - but perhaps that is a debate for another issue .
Yes , we need a global agreement on this , but we need to start at home and whatever we do , rather than just layer on bureaucracy , which we are very often accused of in this place , we need to make sure that the regulations we put in place are effective and tackle the problem at source , so that we do not destroy both the economics and the environment .

( PT ) Madam President , we do indeed have here an excellent report - congratulations to our rapporteur .
The proposal , as has already been said by the Commission , is a good proposal , yet I should like to emphasise the message we were given by the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade , Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna , namely that this is exactly the kind of instrument that can effectively respond to a crisis such as the one we are experiencing in the fisheries sector today .
It is precisely because sustainability rules are not respected in fisheries that fishermen are faced with this crisis , and this is the fundamental lesson that I hope we will all be able to draw from this .
The problem is that the clock is ticking and time does not stand still for our legislative process , and from this point of view , Commissioner , measures must be taken with the utmost urgency , as has already been said here , because otherwise we shall miss the boat in terms of responding to our challenges .
Madam President , if five minutes of the catch-the-eye are not taken up , even people who have contributed to the debate can put a question to the Commissioner .
I have done this several times since the catch-the-eye procedure came in .
Therefore , with your permission , I should like to put a specific question to the Commissioner .
I have been told that I am only allowed to take two speakers .
I am willing to give you the floor .
Madam President , I do not want preferential treatment but there are facilities for five minutes of catch-the-eye .
Could Commissioner Borg comment on the application of subsidies on marine fuels in some Member States and not others and , indeed , on an even-handed approach to subsidies ?
How can this be squared under the common fisheries policy - with an emphasis on common - and does it square with the competition policy rules ?
We have to help the fishing community who , at the moment , are in a severe economic crisis , particularly with the 30 % increase in marine fuel prices .
Could you be sure to respond specifically to this , as requested by several speakers , in your reply ?
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , first of all , the level of the debate on this important subject demonstrates that we share a strong commitment to address the issue of IUU in an effective and comprehensive manner .
The truth of the matter is not only that IUU is an activity that threatens the sustainability of fish stocks , but it is also an activity that threatens the future of honest fishermen within and outside the European Union .
In order for us to be successful in our efforts , we must ensure three crucial principles .
The first is that the scope of the proposal remains comprehensive .
Secondly , the certification scheme put in place must be effective yet ensure that there are no unnecessary burdens imposed as a result .
And the sanctions scheme we proposed must be such that these can serve as effective punitive measures and , therefore , be dissuasive by their very nature .
With regard to these three principles , I have heard confirmation that you have managed to sort out various issues with Member States concerning the scope , the certification scheme and the sanctions .
You have done so without diluting or diminishing the effectiveness of the proposal .
Specifically on the sanctions , let me say that one of the major problems with control is the fact that the range of sanctions applied by Member States is so diverse that it is the sector itself which has consistently and constantly called for a level playing field in this area .
It is for this reason that , at the very least , we have proposed levels which should be applied in a proportionate and in an effective manner .
On the wider issue regarding the reform of the common fisheries policy , I can confirm that we have started reflecting on this and will be having an orientation debate in Council in the coming months .
In fact the idea is to have an informal ministerial meeting in September .
We are also dealing with over-regulation , with a view to simplifying the regulatory regime that is in place .
Let me also say that I cannot agree more with the comment made by Mrs Aubert that the fight against IUU , if effective , will help fishermen to better face up to the problems and the difficulties they are now facing , and this point was made by certain other Members who intervened .
I also , however , agree that it is not sufficient .
On the issue of developing countries , we are committed to addressing this issue effectively , as I said in my opening remarks .
Taking measures to assist developing countries is key if we are to solve the problem and not simply to displace it .
As regards control issues , let me assure the rapporteur that the Commission is coming up with a strong proposal during the third quarter of this year which will also be merged , or harmonised , with the IUU proposal that we have before us .
In that way , both will be convergent and attain the same results .
As regards the fuel crisis , we already have the possibility of medium- to long-term measures that are in place , and this would be in combination with the restructuring of the sector .
We will be looking at the market measures in place - this point was raised by some Members who intervened - which work in such a way that increased costs are borne by the fishermen and are not passed on to the consumer , as happens in other sectors .
We therefore need to look into this in order to find out why .
There are systems in place which bring about a situation whereby it is the fisherman who ends up suffering , who ends up having to bear the increased costs himself , rather than those being passed on to the consumers .
We also offer fishermen some possibilities for providing immediate assistance , if this is linked to restructuring in the form of rescue and restructuring aid .
However , I need to say here that I am also looking at this and am discussing it with my colleagues , with a view to trying to identify other ways and means whereby we can help fishermen face up to this new reality in the very short term .
But I need to underline that we can only do this if there is a firm and a fixed-term commitment to restructuring , because the problem is also that of over-capacity .
Therefore , unless we tackle the problem of over-capacity , we will have a recurring problem for as long as fuel prices remain as they are , or - worse still - if they continue rising , as the indications suggest .
This is what we have done with France , where agreement was reached between the Commission and France on a package of measures which are intended to help the French fisheries sector to restructure .
I have to admit that this was not enough and did not satisfy the French fishermen .
I need to underline that , for the Commission to respond , we also need the cooperation and active engagement of Member States .
We cannot act on our own .
In this regard I understand that this crisis will be raised and discussed at the forthcoming June Council , and I personally welcome it .
On the question raised at the very end by Mrs Doyle concerning the application of subsidies by some Member States and not others , the information that the Commission has is that these subsidies that have been granted by different Member States either fall within the parameters of the de minimis ( and any Member State can grant subsidies as long as they fall within the threshold of de minimis ) or are under restructuring programmes to which I made reference before .
There is the communication with regard to rescue and restructuring aid and , if agreement is reached - if the Commission gives the green light to a restructuring programme - then there are certain possibilities with regard to subsidies , with regard to state assistance , which would not otherwise be possible .
Where we have had information with regard to other subsidies which are not covered either by de minimis or under restructuring programmes , we are investigating them .
There has just been , for example , a notification to France that the amount which was paid in the form of an insurance scheme has to be re-collected .
So we do take action in order to see to it that the European rules with regard to competition are properly observed .
However , I would end by saying that the immediate crisis is such that we need to address it very carefully in order to find ways and means whereby we try to find solutions of an immediate nature but which would also have the conditionality that there is a firm commitment within the short term for the fisheries sector to restructure in order to bring about capacity levels to match what can sustainably be fished out of the seas .
Madam President , I would first of all like to thank the Commissioner and everyone who took part in this debate .
Obviously we have also covered the background to the serious crisis currently affecting the sector .
I should like to thank the Commissioner for trying to give precise answers to the questions raised on this subject , even though it is clearly difficult to go into detail in some areas .
In any case , it is unfortunate that the European Union - or Brussels - should be systematically blamed for everything .
I actually believe that this would be a good opportunity to show that the European Union - Brussels - is not part of the problem , but part of the solution .
Admittedly , when we see the resentment that exists towards the European Union , we realise to what extent Member States and a number of industry members have shirked their responsibilities over the years , prioritising short-term interests , thinking that they can profit from these for a while , but refusing to see that , by doing so , they led an entire sector to the brink of disaster .
This is where we are now .
How can we find instant solutions to a situation that has dragged on for years ?
It is not easy .
You have made a few suggestions .
However , we will not succeed if we do not take strict and drastic measures , if we do not employ all of the necessary means , because these texts will not be enforced without financial and human resources , adopting much more dissuasive sanctions than those that currently exist with regard to illegal fishing .
This at least will not be too hard , considering the low number of fines recently imposed .
We also need to provide much more encouragement and reward for intelligent and sustainable behaviour and practices .
Often , those fishermen and fishing enterprises who are adopting practices that are both extremely compliant and innovative in terms of sustainable fisheries management feel that they go unrecognised and unrewarded .
I also believe that , both in terms of the fight against illegal fishing and other areas that have been covered , such as waste or resource management and quotas , we also need to come up with a much more rewarding strategy , one that is forward-looking and a step in the right direction , which does not currently seem to me to be the case .
To conclude , I believe that this report is a chance for us to raise all of these issues .
Clearly , having this discussion alone will not solve the problems .
I imagine that this discussion will continue in the next report , although it is about time that we had a broad consultation and ended the top-down negotiations between the Commission , governments and industry representatives and had a much wider , more horizontal , cross-disciplinary consultation .
This would provide us with answers and the European Union and Parliament would again be allowed to fulfil their role and embrace their duty to find solutions for this sector in crisis .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 5 June 2008 .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
The European Parliament has delivered a further blow to illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing , which is a real international problem .
The adopted measures effectively complement the existing mechanism .
I am specifically referring to the introduction of a scheme of port state control for vessels entering the port , where a catch certificate would be issued , and the ban on the entry of IUU vessels .
I also welcome the ban on the importation of IUU fish and the publication of a list of vessels involved in IUU fishing .
The added value of these new European rules also stems from the development of a Community alert system when there is a suspicion that IUU fishing has been detected .
The system of sanctions has also been strengthened , including the ban on access to public aid or subsidies by IUU vessels and the repayment of public aid or subsidies received , where necessary .
More importantly , I successfully lobbied the European Parliament to focus on outermost regions in the fight against illegal fishing , due to the exceptional fragility of their ecosystems .
This sends out a strong signal to unscrupulous fleets , which will help clamp down on the unfair competition which is slowly but surely putting our fishermen out of business .
Protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems ( debate )
The next item is the report by Duarte Freitas , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears - C6-0453 / 2007 - .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , Mr Freitas ' report deals with a proposal that opens the way to the introduction of the principle of environmental impact assessments in the fisheries field .
I cannot overstate how important this is in terms of a regime shift and an alignment of fisheries regulation with many other maritime activities .
In addition , this principle responds to a very specific objective - that of preventing damage to vulnerable marine ecosystems .
The proposal fully embodies the ecosystem approach , which the Commission is committed to implementing under the Common Fisheries Policy .
Through this proposal , we respond to the calls made in 2006 by the United Nations General Assembly to take effective action to prevent vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from being destroyed or significantly damaged by bottom fishing activities .
In relation to vessels that operate in areas for which no international conservation and management regime is in place , it is up to the flag State to regulate the activities of its vessels to ensure this protection .
Since the European Union exerts the regulatory competence of the flag State under international law , we must adopt appropriate measures to respond to this UN call by the end of this year .
The regulation , as proposed , will thus apply to EU flagged vessels operating in non-RFMO areas of the high seas .
We currently have a sizeable fleet operating in the South West Atlantic , which is one such area .
The text has been designed to established result obligations by flag Member States , namely to ensure that no fishing permits are to be given to fish with bottom gears unless an assessment of potential impacts clearly demonstrates low risk for vulnerable marine ecosystems .
What this means is that the Commission does not go into the detail as to how Member States are to conduct such assessments , but rather we fix the minimum standards relating to scientific information and then leave it up to Member States to see how to achieve the required results .
Our proposal stipulates that bottom gears cannot be deployed below a depth of 1 000 metres .
The argument that the proposed rule has no scientific basis cannot be sustained .
On the one hand , we are still developing our knowledge of the deep oceans and face so much uncertainty that the full application of the precautionary approach is warranted .
The proposed depth limit is a reasonable choice , as it does not impinge on current EU fleet activities , which are much shallower .
On the other hand , this rule seeks to ensure that we give ourselves time to test how this new regulatory approach works before we allow our fishers to expand into deeper waters .
This is about keeping the present state of our activities in place until we know enough to be more confident about expanding them safely .
The Commission is ready to come back to this specific point in two years ' time , when we submit a report to the Council and to this Assembly on the regulation 's implementation and effectiveness .
It is for these reasons that the Commission cannot accept the deletion of this rule as proposed in the report .
Secondly , Mr Freitas ' report proposes to amend the provision whereby the regulation would impose full observer coverage in the fleets , and stipulate instead a sampling system .
The Commission also has difficulty in accepting this amendment since , with the absence of observers , only VMS remains as a control tool for monitoring compliance by each vessel with its approved fishing plans .
This is not enough , and it is probably unrealistic to expect national fisheries monitoring centres to ensure real-time , individual monitoring of each unit in the fleet .
In addition , without an observer on board , the very important ' move away rule ' in case the vessel accidentally encounters an uncharted ecosystem will simply be inoperative as it is impossible to monitor compliance with this rule by VMS .
As in the previous case , this requirement can be reviewed in two years ' time to assess its effectiveness .
Most of the remaining proposed amendments are acceptable to the Commission , and many have indeed already been brought forward on similar lines during the Council discussions .
I would like to thank Parliament for the support it has expressed to the Commission in our efforts to provide an effective response on this issue .
rapporteur . - ( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should firstly like to congratulate the Commission on the initiative of this proposal , and this for two reasons .
Firstly , because it is in keeping with and follows on from the European Union 's initiative and proactive stance on this matter in the UN General Assembly and , secondly , because it is based on a very important principle , which is assessing the impact of fisheries even before authorisation is given to carry out this activity .
This is because we are talking about areas where there is currently no regional fisheries organisation .
The truth of the matter is that in coastal areas it is the responsibility of the states to adopt measures to protect vulnerable ecosystems from bottom fishing .
In international waters , the protection of the marine environment is generally laid down by regional marine conventions , where these exist , while the adoption of measures for the protection and management of marine living resources and the regulation of the impact of fishing on vulnerable ecosystems comes under the responsibility of Regional Fisheries Management Organisations .
However , there are high-sea areas that are not covered by any fisheries organisation , which is tantamount to an encouragement to engage in destructive fishery activities .
It was with this reality in mind that the UN General Assembly , as you would expect , with the EU playing a leading role , made progress towards a notion of the need to do something to protect the seabed , where there is currently no control whatsoever .
This is indeed positive action , which we should highlight and welcome , as we should the Commission 's own proposal , yet this is also a proposal that we can call generous , as we shall force ships flying the flag of our Member States to respect a set of rules that we will have to ensure , via diplomatic channels , that other third countries fishing in these areas we are talking about - the deep seabed - also follow suit .
Otherwise there is little point in the European Union having to lead the way and oblige its ships to conduct these studies and fulfil a set of requirements if other ships under other flags then engage in destructive fishing practices in the very area that we wish to protect .
There is , therefore , one area in this generous proposal for which we have to congratulate the Commission , that must have a consequence as regards diplomatic efforts , based also on the agreement reached with the UN General Assembly , so that we can really take a step forward in this matter .
As regards some of this issues mentioned here - the 1 000 metre issue - Commissioner , in the Committee on Fisheries we were able to hold a hearing with specialists , and I was able to listen to a number of specialists , and their consensus of opinion is that the 1 000 metres , or 800 , or 500 , or 1 200 , are not a technical measure but merely a policy choice .
Yet , if with this proposal we are already forcing those who wish to fish in a certain area to study the seabeds beforehand and the risk in these seabeds , it is my belief that this study will encompass all depths from 800 to 1 100 , or to 1 500 , and , therefore , there would be no need to set a clear definition of 1 000 metres , as this is already protected in another way .
However , we are still waiting for some further justification , possibly of a technical nature , that the specialists we heard were not able to pin point , but I think that what the Commissioner has said up to now does not present sufficient grounds for us to suppose that the 1 000 metre proposal would be valid .
Nevertheless , we shall keep on waiting and we do in fact hope that the European Parliament 's proposal may be taken into consideration following tomorrow 's vote .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - Madam President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
Many marine ecosystems in the high seas are unique and vulnerable and - most definitely and appropriately - need protection from the sometimes devastatingly catastrophic effects of bottom fishing gears .
The proposed regulation is undoubtedly a good step in the right direction , but much more may need to be done in the future as more knowledge and experience is gathered on deep-sea marine biology .
The application of the precautionary principle , as a basis for formulating some of the parameters of this regulation , is judged to be both necessary and wise .
As always , the success of any regulation depends to a large extent on the degree of its proper implementation , and on-board observers will help in this respect .
It is very much hoped that , despite some inevitable inherent weaknesses in this respect , this regulation will turn out to be a success both in theory and in practice .
Madam President , we are obviously all in favour of protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems from destructive fishing practices .
In fact , I am so much in favour of it that I would even advocate protecting them against all destructive practices , including non-fishing practices .
Ultimately , however , we already know that in these cases it is up to the fisheries sector to lead the way and set an example .
As I have already said in relation to the report by Mrs Miguélez on deep-sea fish stocks , I think that our main concern should be to protect all vulnerable ecosystems that have been identified as such , wherever they are , not just those that are lucky enough to be below a depth of 1 000 metres .
As Mr Freitas has already said , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) has ruled out the depth criterion as being arbitrary and non-scientific , and the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations ( RFMOs ) , including the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation ( NAFO ) , have even ruled out the 2 000 metre rule , without even considering a 1 000 metre limit , as in their opinion the limit would serve no purpose , so they have removed it .
However , my question , Commissioner , is as follows : you have said that this is going to be applied to the fleets that fish on the Patagonian shelf .
Recently representatives of the Ocean Institute were here presenting assessment studies in which they did not detect any vulnerable marine ecosystems in that area .
I would therefore like to ask you whether you are going to continue to insist on applying this proposal to the Community fleet that fishes in that area .
Finally I would like to discuss the subject of observers , regarding which I think that the report by Mr Freitas has provided a considerable dose of reason .
I think , and I am in agreement with the report , that it is important to have observers who are scientists , as they have to evaluate vulnerable marine ecosystems , which cannot be done by just any observer .
As has been said by the scientists themselves , however , it seems absurd to have one per boat , because as well as emptying our oceanography institutes , there would be no point in having one per boat , as it is much more important to consider planned and organised sampling programmes that are maintained over time , which is what is going to give us a good monitoring overview of these fisheries .
I would therefore be grateful , Commissioner , if you could answer my questions , and I call for support for the report by Mr Freitas .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Madam President , I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur for this excellent report and by reiterating that what we are dealing with here is the protection of the seabed , inter alia deep-water coral reefs , seamounts , hydrothermal vents and deep-water sponges , which are priceless treasures of our ecosystems .
I should also like to recall that protection of these ecosystems had long been assured in the Autonomous Region of the Azores and it was only in 2003 that it was jeopardised by the European institutions , when they decided to open up fishing in this region indiscriminately , without any consideration for the need to protect these ecosystems .
Above all , the most important issue seems to me to be for us to have totally consistent legislation and the problem with the 1 000 metres is that it does not make any sense to say that one cannot fish below 1 000 metres outside European waters , and yet one can fish below 1 000 metres in European waters - this does not make any sense from the point of view of the legislation 's environmental soundness .
What concerns me most of all is that this UN Resolution - the key Resolution 61 / 105 of 8 December 2006 - concerns several other measures , namely those related to protecting sea turtles that live on the surface and that , unfortunately , the European Commission , instead of transposing this decision in its entirety , decided to start point by point , sector by sector , several years later .
This does not seem to me to be the best legislative modus operandi .
It would be better if the entire UN decision were transposed at Community level and this would then simplify things immensely and make the legislation much more operable both within and outside Community waters .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we all agree that there is a need to adopt measures to eliminate destructive fishing practices that threaten vulnerable marine ecosystems .
With this in mind we agree with the idea that Union vessels that operate in deep-sea areas that are not subject to any regional fisheries organisation or agreement should be subject to Community regulations governing the conditions that they must fulfil in order to obtain the relevant special permits at these depths , and specifying the subsequent conduct that they must observe , the information they must provide , etc .
We do not , however , agree with the restrictions that the Commission was proposing in Article 6 , setting as a reasonable option a maximum depth of 1 000 metres for the deployment of bottom gears , as it considers that this limit offers an appropriate level of protection , because there is no established data to back this up .
There are no scientific studies that show whether vulnerable ecosystems are below or above those 1 000 metre levels .
We think that we need to move forward and better document the seabed in each area , identifying where the vulnerabilities are , before indicating any maximum depth for deployment .
We think that it would be a good idea that , if a vessel happened to come across a possible vulnerable marine ecosystem , it should be obliged to stop fishing and inform the appropriate authorities .
With this in mind , we agree with the proposal that a representative sample of the vessels to which each Member State has issued a special fishing permit should take a scientific observer on board , ensuring a suitable rotation among all vessels for successive fishing trips .
Finally , we also agree that , in the event of a technical problem with the satellite positioning device that each vessel must carry , the captain should communicate the vessel 's geographical location at 2-hour intervals and that , when it returns to port , it should not be able to return to sea until it can be verified that the positioning system is functioning correctly .
All of this is being proposed not only with the aim of greater sustainability of the marine environment , but also in order to safeguard the fishing activities that are necessary in order to provide us with food .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his excellent report .
A central part of maritime management is the protection of vulnerable ecosystems .
Significant efforts have been made over the last few years to achieve this .
I am delighted that the European Union is undertaking this pioneering work to protect the environment - it will benefit each and every one of us .
The Ecosystem Policy is internationally accepted and it is now up to us to implement it as extensively as possible .
A system made up of small steps is suitable for the implementation of this policy .
We can learn from each small step before moving on to the next one - evolution and not revolution is the key .
The protection of vulnerable ecosystems is complicated .
There is a wonderful example of this in Ireland .
Deep-water coral can be found off the west coast of the country .
It was announced in the NATURA 2000 that this coastal region had four sites and there is a limit imposed on fishing there in order to protect the deep-water coral .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( PT ) Whilst broadly supporting the proposals in the report that aim to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas , we would like to stress the need for the measures adopted in this field to be taken based on scientific fisheries research and in an appropriate fashion , that is to say , in the light of the diversity of existing situations .
This need is immediately apparent in terms of the definition of a vulnerable marine ecosystem , which , as a matter of fact , as the report highlights , pointing out the need to find a definition according to the best scientific information .
Similarly , we need to distinguish between the different consequences of using the different gear , assessing their potential impacts on marine resources and the seabed through scientific fisheries research .
Lastly , we should like to state once again that we believe the area of questions related to inspections or observation omissions falls within the competence of each Member State .
Madam President , scientists in the fishing industry now know that the deep and high seas are teeming with life , most of which remains undiscovered .
In fact , about 50 % of the animals or flora collected from areas deeper than 3 000 metres are a new species .
Scientists have speculated that as many as 10 million species may inhabit the deep sea , biodiversity comparable to the world 's richest tropical rain forests .
They are slowly discovering ecosystems which are extraordinary in nature , often hosting species found nowhere else on the planet .
I therefore welcome the Commission 's proposals to require high-seas fishing activities with bottom gears to be subject to a permit , and that the responsible authority will determine that there are no significant adverse impacts on ecosystems in the high seas before issuing the permits .
Action is long overdue in this area and I would like to thank Duarte Freitas for his report .
Bottom trawling is causing unprecedented damage to the deep-sea coral and sponge communities .
Unregulated bottom gear can also reach submerged mountains or seamounts , bulldozing their way across the ocean floor and destroying all life in their path .
Species may become extinct before scientists even have a chance to identify them .
Unfortunately , the European Union is at the epicentre of deep-sea bottom trawling .
In 2001 , Member States , including our new Baltic States , took approximately 60 % of the high-seas bottom-trawl catch and in the same year Spain alone accounted for approximately two-thirds of the reported EU catch and 40 % of the reported global catch in high-seas bottom-trawl fisheries .
I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission must use the powers it has beyond the fisheries sector to promote concerted action to protect vulnerable ecosystems and our approach must be guided by two key principles : the precautionary approach , which requires us to act when there is a lack of scientific information or uncertainty , and , above all else , ecosystem-based management .
Commissioner , is the 1 000 metre figure an arbitrary figure ?
I think it is a question of whether vulnerable ecosystems exist above this figure and not just below it , as some colleagues have questioned .
ALDE ) . - Madam President , several speakers have claimed that there is no scientific evidence - or no evidence at all - to support the choice of the depth limit of 1000 metres .
This is not so .
In fact , to give you an example , there is scientific evidence from fishing operations at 840 to 1300 metres in the west of Ireland .
Carbon-14 dating revealed that the cold-water coral matrix taken as by-catch in this fishery was at least 4550 years old .
So there are vulnerable ecosystems - as shown by scientific evidence - at that depth .
In addition to using the precautionary principle , I think it is wise to choose to have such a limit .
( PL ) Madam President , the European Union is an active participant in the search for global solutions to the question of the use of bottom trawling gear .
Instead of instituting a complete ban on their use , it is in favour of imposing strict restrictions governing their application .
The Regulation under discussion is a sort of modus vivendi .
The legislative effects obtained are not always based on a clear and convincing provision , however .
Smaller fishing environments deprived of the potential for regular and detailed studies are simply worried that they may not be in a position to meet the requirements for drafting a corresponding catch plan together with the requirement to specify the depth at which the trawling gear will be used , or - which is of particular concern to the poorer areas - the configuration of the sea bed .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I welcome the number of points and comments that have been made , which underline the importance you attach to the issue of dealing with destructive fishing practices .
As I said earlier , our proposal responds to a call by the international community and we must show our determination to meet that call .
On the issue of the proposed 1 000-metre depth limit , I wish to say that it is crucial that we adopt a precautionary approach , and this chosen limit was designed in a way that provides us with an assurance that we do not have a sudden development of fisheries in a particular area .
At the same time , it does not , at this juncture , actually affect current fisheries , and if this is the case I do not understand why there is such resistance to the 1 000-metre limit .
But I will look into it again and I am hopeful that this issue can be resolved satisfactorily in the Council in June .
However , I would also say that I do not agree that we should allow unlimited bottom fishing until we have identified vulnerable ecosystems , because once the harm is done , it is done , and then it is too late .
This is why we insist on the precautionary approach .
On the issue of observers , let me say that this is a crucial point if we are to show that we are serious about the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas .
Having full coverage is a key point for the Commission .
I am confident that we can find a solution to this issue too in the Council in June without abandoning the principle of full observer coverage .
rapporteur . - ( PT ) It is with regret that I would first of all like to say that the Commissioner has not heeded what virtually all Members have said and what the report states with regard to the 1 000 metres .
There is no , I repeat , no scientific evidence that the figure of 1 000 metres is appropriate .
Why 1 000 ?
Why not 800 or 1 200 ?
There is no scientific evidence and we held a hearing with specialists and we were able to have with us the head of the Department of Oceanography and Fisheries of the Azores who has conducted many good , internationally-recognised studies of the seabed , along with other people with whom I spoke , other technical experts : there is no scientific evidence that the 1 000 metre figure is reasonable .
As a matter of fact , the 1 000 metres may well have been lifted from the discussions relating to the Mediterranean , yet we are not dealing with the same area , in fact we are talking about completely different areas !
So let us wait and see , my friends : if we are rightly obliging the European Union to take the lead in these processes of protecting the deep seabed , which is a good thing , and hopefully bringing others along behind us , we have this environmental responsibility , but we also have to be a little objective and reasonable .
If , to be able to fish in these areas we are talking about , we require fleets to submit scientific studies for which the Commission has been unable to put a figure on costs , nor tell us whether the Member States will be in a position to assess the quality and respond to these scientific studies , yet if we require fleets to submit such studies to ascertain if the seabed is vulnerable or not , let us then be reasonable ourselves !
Let us not then talk about 1 000 metres .
If there are vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems , they may lie at 800 or 1 200 metres , but the studies we are making fleets submit in order to obtain fishing licences will show this : it is as simple as that and therefore I believe that it is a question of being reasonable on this matter .

To conclude , just one last reference to the importance of this matter : it is said that we know more about the surface of the moon than we know about the deep seabed and for that reason here in this Chamber we shall be pushing ourselves as individuals to help in discovering more about the deep seabed .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 5 June 2008 .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
The strengths of the regulation proposal are the introduction of the precaution principle and the issuing of a fishing permit , with the application of an assessment from certifying that these activities do not have negative effects upon marine ecosystems .
As a fictional rapporteur , I considered it necessary that these assessments be based upon aligned criteria at the level of the Community , which are revised by the Commission in order to provide a uniform evaluation by all member states .
Furthermore , I proposed the creation of an electronic mapping system with a view to the creation of a database of the vulnerable marine ecosystems which shall reduce the costs and efforts regarding the assessment and issuing of the fishing permit .
In other words , the proposed elements have been introduced to improve system efficiency and to ensure the optimal protection of marine biodiversity .
It is also essential that , by the end of 2008 , the Commission set out a list of the areas that are to be closed , indicating the confirmed sites , as well as the ones in which the presence of vulnerable marine ecosystems is likely .
Yet , we must not forget the role that the Member States have in the protection of marine fauna by means of the implementation of the obligations arising from the Directive on habitats and the nominalization of marine ecosystems in the national legislation of the Natura 2000 network .
Implementing trade policy through efficient import and export rules and procedures ( debate )
The next item is the report by Jean-Pierre Audy , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on implementing trade policy through efficient import and export rules and procedures .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the customs union , which celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2008 , was one of the first stages of European integration .
It has led to the abolition of all import and export customs duties between EU Member States and to the adoption of a common foreign tariff .
It is a vital aspect of the proper functioning of the internal market and the correct application of the Union 's trade agreements .
Within the customs union , the efficiency of import and export procedures is vital for the Union 's competitiveness and for the protection of its citizens .

Commissioner , you recently published the customs figures for 2007 , which show , and I quote , ' new and alarming tendencies ' .
You said that counterfeiting continues to endanger our health , our safety and our economy .
In terms of consumer protection , there are numerous concerns and my report contains proposals regarding compliance with European standards , particularly in terms of health and safety .
Another example is the issue of cigarette smuggling , which was raised in Parliament last September and for which I was rapporteur for my political group .
This highlighted the scale of the problem and revealed weaknesses in our Community transit system .
This is why the Committee on International Trade questions the quality of our customs system and its ability to cope with the challenges inherent in trade globalisation in a context where our citizens expect the Union to protect them .
This at least is what is proposed by the Treaty of Lisbon , currently undergoing ratification by the Member States , which states in Article 1 ( 4 ) that in its relations with the wider world , the Union shall contribute to the protection of its citizens .
At international level , the main uncertainty is the outcome of the Doha Round negotiations conducted by the World Trade Organization , where any agreement seems a far-off prospect .
We all know that if the multilateral trade negotiations break down , we will end up with bilateral competition - which as we are all aware is governed by the law of survival of the fittest - and we will need a strong and effective customs union .
Even within the World Customs Organization , we are seeing less progress in terms of efficiency and global harmonisation of customs procedures , following the security concerns that emerged in the United States in the wake of 9 / 11 .
Nevertheless , in terms of international trade , the report points out that if import and export rules and procedures are too strict , this can represent a non-tariff barrier to trade .
I invite the Commission to focus particularly on small and medium-sized enterprises , which consider excessively burdensome customs rules and procedures as one of the key obstacles to international trade .
The customs system must be used to facilitate trade , and the report proposes that this issue be the subject of an international agreement , to be dealt with separately from the Doha Agenda .
The report also examines the numerous issues linked with the tariff classification , value and origin - both preferential and non-preferential - of goods , in the hope that the Commission will heed the demands of the industrial sectors concerned .
Finally , I would like to stress that the ongoing lack of harmonisation seems to me to be a clear cause of the weakening of the European customs system .
I understand , Commissioner , that the reform of the Customs Code is a priority for the Commission and that it is already a sufficiently complex task without being combined with institutional reform .
However , I wish to open up a debate by proposing that consideration be given to the possible creation of integrated and coordinated national customs administrations , with a view to moving towards a Community administration in charge of the customs union .
Indeed , the increasingly pro-harmonisation nature of the customs rules means that the role of customs is de facto becoming identical throughout the Union .
In view of the long periods of time required for developments to take place in the Community , especially those which affect the prerogatives of the Member States , I believe that the time has come to lay this issue on the table .
It is an issue which is both symbolic , in that it is the crowning achievement of 40 years of increasingly advanced customs integration , and pragmatic , in that it reflects the need for a more efficient customs organisation in an increasingly complex , fast-moving world which will not wait for us .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I am pleased that you allow me to react to the report prepared by Jean-Pierre Audy and unanimously adopted by the Committee on International Trade on 6 May .
I congratulate the rapporteur , who perfectly highlighted the essential contribution of customs legislation and customs services to an effective implementation of our common trade policy , and also identified the important challenges that the Union is facing in this matter .
My services are doing their best to ensure that regulations or agreements on international trade take fully into account the contribution , but also the necessary constraints , of customs concepts and procedures .
They also actively defend the Community interests in international organisations dealing with customs matters , in particular the World Customs Organisation and the World Trade Organisation .
That is particularly the case concerning the rules of origin , both non-preferential and preferential .
On 27 May , the Committee on International Trade was informed of the state of play of the reform of these rules for the Generalised System of Preferences .
I am confident that , based on the various contributions received , the Commission will be in a position to find support from the Member States to complete this reform .
That is also true concerning the WTO negotiations on trade facilitation .
The Commission is still convinced at this stage that a trade facilitation agreement should remain one of the pillars of the conclusion of the Doha Round , and should not be removed from it .
Of course , the results of the negotiations on trade facilitation achieved so far should in any case not be lost .
Important steps have been taken to respond to the threats posed by counterfeited , pirated and dangerous products .
New procedures have been introduced into customs legislation for the purpose of guaranteeing security and safety .
The modernised Community Customs Code , published today , and the decision on the electronic customs published in January represent major milestones in the constant but dynamic contribution of customs legislation to both the protection of European citizens and the competitiveness of our economy by facilitating legitimate trade .
They constitute examples of good interinstitutional cooperation .
The report also legitimately insists on the need for further harmonisation and uniformity in the implementation of the customs legislation , and for further improving the organisation and working methods of our customs administrations .
In my view , further harmonisation in implementing customs legislation can be achieved through the following initiatives : the current work on the implementation of the modernised Customs Code and the e-Customs Decision ; a new programme for targeted monitoring of the correct and uniform application of customs legislation , and an assessment , in partnership with the Member States , of the needs and possibilities to approximate customs offences and penalties .
The ' Customs 2013 ' Programme also represents an important tool in that respect .

To conclude , I would like to react to the points of the report concerning the US 100 % scanning initiative .
The Commission is using all possible channels to make the US authorities understand that they have chosen the wrong way to secure the supply chain .
The Commission provided the US Government in April with a solid report , prepared with the contribution of Member States , which stresses the negative impact of this measure on the European ports , international trade and maritime traffic .


on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( CS ) Madam President , I welcome the own-initiative report by my colleague Mr Audy , which looks at the importance of rigorously implementing customs procedures for the proper functioning of the internal market .
Sadly , our market is more and more distorted by illegal imports of goods from third countries .
This concerns not just smuggling , counterfeiting and evading customs duties : our market is also flooded with goods that do not meet the European safety standards , although many of them bear the compliance mark .
Unfortunately , customs authorities do not have enough resources to carry out sufficient border controls .
Our committee was able to witness in Antwerp how only one half of one percent of containers are checked each day .
All of this undermines trust in the internal market and hurts consumers as well as European producers who cannot cope with such unfair competition on their own .
Although our customs union has been around for 40 years , the Member States still do not apply customs regulations in a sufficiently uniform manner .
For example , there are significant differences in the rules on tariff classification , value and origin - preferential and non-preferential - of goods .
I agree with the rapporteur that the situation would benefit from greater harmonisation .
The Commission should also respond to the justified objections with regard to the uniform application of the value-added criterion , such as the objections raised by the textiles industry .
Overly strict and complex customs regulations impede access to international trade for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular .
It is obvious that European competitiveness would benefit from simplification , modernisation and harmonisation of the rules and procedures with regard to the import and export of goods .

Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Audy on the top quality report he has produced , both in terms of the ideas contained therein and the proposals it makes .
In actual fact , customs , as the report explicitly says , are a multifunctional tool nowadays .
They play a fiscal role , their original role , but they also play an economic role and an ever increasing role in terms of protecting the security of European businesses and European consumers .
From an economic point of view , they naturally have to facilitate international trade and the European Union has every interest in seeing this happen .
Yet they also have to focus on their security role , in terms of thwarting and fighting against counterfeiting and piracy , combating situations of totally unfair competition that undermine some European businesses , especially in weaker sectors and in terms of protecting the environment and public health , which are assets that our communities are increasingly coming to appreciate .
This is why we need to make more headway .
The proposal outlined by the rapporteur is , in our view , a good one , as it follows the line of promoting harmonisation of the customs system .
We have a community trade policy and a community customs policy , but we then have a series of national administrations that do not always work together in the most appropriate way .
To ensure that the interests of European producers and consumers are protected , it would be advantageous if we could progress more quickly towards harmonisation .
Progress through new practices , establishing better coordination and creating conditions for the effective harmonisation of customs administration at Community level .
We shall therefore be doing European citizens a good service , both from the viewpoint of producers and consumers .
There is also an issue that I believe to be very important and that relates to small and medium-sized enterprises , and that is also addressed in the report and was tackled by the previous speaker .
Our small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly vulnerable in situations where we fall prey to unfair competition and our customs system is not always ready to deal successfully with such risks .
We therefore need to invest heavily in this and improve coordination with small and medium-sized enterprises themselves .
They are not always experts on the rules and procedures , and are therefore at a disadvantage in terms of their ability to access international trade .
I shall end as I began , by congratulating the author of this report , that I believe has done Europe a service in this specific and very important field of the customs system .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Madam President , in taking the floor on behalf of the UEN Group in this debate , I wish to draw attention to three matters .
Firstly , many countries involved in international trade facilitation , even those that are WTO members , fail to observe social and environmental standards , which leads to a marked diminution in their manufacturing costs , while at the same time ruling out fair competition .
Improving access to the European market for goods originating from such countries must take this aspect into account , otherwise many spheres of manufacturing in Europe will be routinely eliminated .
Secondly , the increasing openness of the European market for goods of agricultural origin from third countries in exchange for opening up these countries for exports of European industrial goods and services is in fact a realisation of Commissioner Mandelson 's idea that the European Union must make concessions to other countries as part of WTO negotiations , because the European Union earns more from exports of industrial goods than it disburses on its weak defence of agriculture , but unfortunately this means a continuation of the weakening of Europe 's agricultural potential .
Thirdly and finally , the European Commission must respond a lot more promptly than hitherto to breaches by third country exporters of agreements on access to the European market , and if exports originating from such countries suppress European production , the Commission must act without delay and not only after many months have elapsed .



( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , it is like customs night here tonight , with Mr Markov 's report on the GSP and Mr Audy 's report on non-tariff barriers , in other words these import and export rules and procedures which we call administrative protectionism , or self-righteous customs barriers .
Although the WTO talks a great deal about reducing GATT tariffs , we also have subtle protectionism in the form of quotas , peak tariffs - Europe has more than 110 peak tariffs ; Canada , admittedly , has 430 - and graduated import duties that prevent small countries from becoming industrialised , not to mention a list of sensitive products and a GSP which is conditional on respect for human rights and the subjective state of play of customs rules of origin , value or tariff lines .
Europe has more than 5 000 tariff lines .
In agriculture alone , we have 2 726 tariff lines .
Japan , admittedly , has 1 890 and the USA has 1 779 , so what do we do with goods when it comes to tariff lines ?
For example , how do we classify a mummy that arrives here from Egypt for an exhibition ?
We classify it as dried fish !
Mr Audy 's report covers all of these problems and recognises that the US has returned to customs McCarthyism with a security / insecurity witch-hunt .
The era of the pacifist approach of Pope John Paul II , with his famous 1978 homily ( ' Open the borders of states , political and economic systems , wide expanses of civilisations and cultures to His grace .
Do not be afraid ! ' ) , is over , hence the Doha Round , which is still ongoing 10 years after it was started , whereas the Uruguay Round , if I may be so bold as to say , only took 8 years .
What is the root of this problem ?
The problem stems from the fact that customs duties are 2 000 years old and date back to ancient Rome , to Rome tolls .
However , this is the 21st century , and as such , Commissioner , we need new customs technology .
Fortunately this new customs technology has been invented by scientists and involves deductible customs duties that can be adapted according to the production cost differential , that are refundable , that can be traded on an exchange and that can be modified to help developing countries .
This , Commissioner , is what you should lay on the WTO negotiating table - this new customs technology - so that we can abolish our archaic customs system .
( BG ) Mme President , Commissioner , Colleagues , We are discussing an extremely important report today .
The effective trade policy is an instrument for achieving regional or broader integration .
Imports and exports , against the backdrop of reliable rules and procedures , enable us to protect the European internal economic space .
The spirit of the report is objective and critical , yet constructive .
It focuses on several theses , i.e. the bilateral , regional and multilateral mutual benefit , the common regional prospects , the enhanced competitiveness of the European Union through market-based instruments to prevent the ousting of European products from the market .
Trade determines a large portion of the economic growth of some countries .
In this sense , import and export rules are of paramount importance .
Their implementation and control are of special significance , particularly for some new Member States like Bulgaria , where higher export levels determine the existence of trade deficit .
In this case , the access to third markets becomes crucial .
The difficult entry of goods from the new countries into external markets , even when these products fully meet all requirements , generates conditions for unequal treatment .
Therefore what we need is full consistency of the legislation and its implementing regulations .
The work of the national customs authorities is essential for the proper functioning of an efficient trade system , especially in the context of their enhanced mission to combat forgeries and fraud , and to protect intellectual property rights and consumers .
National costoms authorities need to collaborate in a well organised manner .
It is equally important to undertake measures for proper motivation of customs authorities within the framework of the administraive solutions of each Member State , as well as for protection and support of the mission of customs authorities .
It is possible to consider the establishment of specialised centres in countries of key importance for the trade with third countries or regions respectively . This would be useful with a view to promoting the effective trade policy of the European Union .
( CS ) Madam President , there is one issue that has not been debated so far .
I want to ask the Commissioner what steps the European Union has taken to date with regard to the regulations applied by the US .
What , in his opinion , are the best ways of coordinating trade procedures within the framework of transatlantic relations and , basically , can he see any possibility of achieving a good balance between security measures and the need for a more flexible economic relationship between Europe and the US ?
I am referring to the requirements concerning containers , which are also mentioned in the report by my colleague Mr Audy .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would firstly like to thank you for your interest and contribution to the improvement of our legislation and practice in the customs area .
I want to emphasise that the two legal documents - the modernised Customs Code and the e-Customs Decision - will make the functioning of the European Union 's customs services better , faster and even cheaper .
I am , of course , at the disposal of Parliament to keep you informed of the main developments in the field of customs legislation and its implementation .
On 1 April the Commission adopted a new communication on a strategy for the evolution of the Customs Union , which was supported by a resolution of the Council .
The future customs initiative resulting from this communication will support customs in providing an appropriate and balanced response to the double challenge that they face - on the one hand ensuring the safety and security control of goods at the external borders and , on the other hand , facilitating trade .
To this end , the initiative envisages moving from the current transaction-based approach of customs formalities and controls to a system-based approach , focusing on the internal control systems and supply chain of the economic operators .
Such a new approach implies new working and control methods and a future customs risk management strategy .
It will also offer a platform for working with the Member States on the most appropriate operational structures to be put in place in the future for an efficient functioning of the customs union .
Regarding Mrs Roithová 's question about the US Congress 's hundred percent scanning initiative : even before it was adopted by the Congress we had made a number of efforts to change the proposal , but failed to do so .
The US Administration showed a great deal of understanding because they also realised that the introduction of such measures would be a unilateral step and so would be contrary to our bilateral and multilateral approach .
The US Administration understood that it would certainly not increase security but , on the contrary , would generate a false sense of security , which would divert resources and attention from the real security measures .
Our concept is the future recognition of security standards , of security controls , the result of security controls and also the mutual recognition of the customs trade partnership : the CT Pact on the US side and the authorised economic operator on the EU side .
I mention this because there was some reference , in connection with SMEs , to the fact that this authorised economic operator is a very good system for making life better and easier for small and medium-sized companies .

We quite recently provided information for the US Administration when , in April , we presented a report to Michael Chertoff and to the Customs and Border Protection of the US in which we explained what kind of difficulties we expect from the introduction of hundred percent scanning : the disruption of trade , the disturbances in maritime traffic and also in bilateral trade relations .
Just to give you one figure : in one single year the US receives more than ten million sea containers .
We send some two million containers from the EU , and this system , if introduced , would cover more than 700 ports all over the world , so you can imagine what kind of problems it will cause .
We hope that , step by step , not only the US Administration but also the legislators will come to understand that it will certainly not increase security , but will create very serious problems in bilateral and multilateral trade .
Finally , as emphasised in the report , 2008 is the year of the 40th anniversary of the Customs Union .
It will also be the year of a new start for the Community and the Member States in that field .
Madam President , Commissioner Kovǎcs , thank you for your answers .
I would like to extend our thanks to the Commission staff that I have worked with , as well as members of the Committee on International Trade , such as Mr Musquar , and rapporteurs from the political groups , such as Mr Assis .
I am also happy to see his colleague Mrs Lyubcheva here today , as we recently worked together on another matter .
You were right , Mrs Roithová , to draw attention to the problem of 100 % scanning , and thank you , Commissioner , for the resolve you have shown in defending us .
It is not the first time that the EU has come under attack from the United States on these issues , since we also had to defend our customs system in a case brought before the WTO Dispute Settlement Body ( DSB ) , which we won , partly down to the efforts of your staff , Commissioner .
You were right to defend us .
Mr Martinez has explained his theory on inverted tariffs to us .
He also explained this to me back in December 2005 , when we were in Hong Kong together .
I still do not understand them , but I live in hope that one day I will be able to see how these inverted tariffs apply to mummies and dried fish .
I would like to thank all of the political groups for the support they have shown for this report .
I believe that people can now see that the world , which is becoming more complicated and fast-paced , would in the past have resolved conflict by a military war . Today , we have an economic and social war , rather than a military war .
Instead of deaths , we have unemployment . In any case , we no longer really know who the enemy is .
It is in this climate of a worldwide economic and social war that we need to have a strong customs union and import and export mechanisms that protect - and I am talking about protection , not protectionism - our businesses , citizens and the European Union in general .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Forced prostitution and trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation ( debate )
The next item is the debate on the oral question - B6-0160 / 2008 ) to the Commission by Anna Záborská , on behalf of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , on forced prostitution and trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation .
Madam President , Commissioner , with these oral questions , this Parliament 's Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality would once again like to request that attention be given to the huge problem regarding trafficking in women and forced prostitution in the European Union .
Exact figures do not exist but , according to rough estimates , hundreds of thousands of women and girls are trafficked each year by criminal gangs , subsequently ending up in forced prostitution in our Member States .
This is a degrading issue and , unfortunately , the approach of the European Union and Member States is having barely any effect .
It is a well-known fact that large-scale events , such as major football championships , draw in criminal gangs involved in these degrading practices , and it is for this reason that the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality launched a campaign on International Women 's Day , 8 March 2006 , to draw the public 's attention to the need to prevent and combat trafficking in women and forced prostitution during the 2006 football World Cup .
This ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' campaign was a huge success in raising awareness not only among audiences , supporters , but also in society that trafficking in women and forced prostitution must be actively combated .
Nevertheless , the results of the approach of the European Commission and the majority of Member States are unfortunately still disappointing .
We should therefore like to raise this issue once again , and make it clear to audiences and to society during Euro 2008 this month that this type of violence against women and girls is unacceptable .
In 2005 the Commission and the Council adopted a detailed action plan on the exchange of best practices , standards and procedures for combating and preventing trafficking in women .
It is important that Member States do implement this action plan .
One of our questions also focuses upon this .
After all , a coordinated policy is required in related areas , such as gender-specific prevention strategies , including in the countries these women and girls come from , and also awareness-raising measures and an evaluation of their effectiveness .
Can the Commission therefore answer the following questions ?
Has the action plan been implemented regarding trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation , what is the result and how effective has it been ?
What specific measures have been reported by Member States in order to combat trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation ?
To what extent have Member States correctly transposed and implemented Directive 2004 / 81 / EC , and what actions has the Commission taken if this was not the case ?
Is the study on the links between the legislation on prostitution and the extent of trafficking in women and girls for the purpose of sexual exploitation , requested by the European Parliament Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality since January 2006 , now available ?
Can the Commission indicate if and how it intends to encourage Member States to build on and further develop cross-border police cooperation in the field of the fight against trafficking in human beings and forced prostitution ?
How can the Commission support the Committee 's ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' campaign ?
Is the competent Commissioner also prepared to send a letter to the governments of Austria and Switzerland to call upon them to combat trafficking in women and forced prostitution during the coming Euro 2008 football championship and to support our ' Red Card ' campaign ?
Madam President , it is general knowledge that major football championships are a source of great pleasure and fun for audiences and supporters , but this is nevertheless a problem that constitutes a dark side to the events , to which attention must be devoted , and not just in terms of words ; after all , to quote a well-known Dutch football song : ' geen woorden maar daden ' [ actions speak louder than words ] .
I hope that the Commissioner also wants to support this .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , although the issue does not fall within in my portfolio , I feel privileged to substitute for my good friend and colleague Jacques Barrot , and to participate in this debate , because I am convinced that this is a very important issue .
I wish to assure you that the Commission is wholeheartedly committed to the fight against trafficking in human beings as a brutal violation of human rights and as a very serious criminal offence , and is in particular committed to fighting forced prostitution .
Concerning the very relevant questions , which cover the whole complex issue , I will start with Question No 1 .
The 2005 EU action plan on best practices , standards and procedures launched by the Council contains a very ambitious array of measures to fight trafficking in human beings .
On the basis of the information submitted by the Member States , our impression is that , although some results have been achieved , the situation remains unsatisfactory concerning both criminal proceedings and assistance to victims , which is of particular importance .
The Commission will be delivering a report on its implementation by the end of this year .
This stocktaking exercise could form the basis for deciding what actions to pursue in the near future , and in what form .
Question No 2 : the protection of victims of trafficking is a human rights duty .
Furthermore , it is an essential condition for the successful prosecution of traffickers , as victims ' testimony is vital to getting convictions .
Directive 2004 / 81 / EC follows that line by providing for the granting of a reflection period allowing the victim to recover and escape the influence of traffickers , and granting a residence permit .
All Member States bound by the above Directive have officially notified full transposition of the legal instrument to the Commission , with the exception of Spain and Luxembourg .
The Commission has decided to refer those two Member States to the European Court of Justice .
As regards the analysis of its substantial transposition and implementation , in January 2007 the Commission launched a study to evaluate the transposition into national law of 10 directives in the field of asylum and immigration , including this Directive .
The final findings of that study , which will soon be made available to the Commission , will provide the basis for a systematic monitoring of the existing acquis in this area , in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty .
Question No 3 : the Commission has also launched a study to evaluate Member States ' legislation and the situation concerning trafficking in human beings .
The results of the study are expected to be delivered by the end of February 2009 .
Question No 4 : forced prostitution and trafficking in human beings are a violation of fundamental rights and are one type of organised crime .
Efforts to combat criminal networks must necessarily be transnational .
Cross-border cooperation between Member States ' police forces has a privileged channel in Europol .
In addition , the fight against trafficking in human beings is a priority area in the financial programme ' Prevention of and Fight against Crime ' , which supports transnational cooperation projects involving law enforcement authorities , as well as NGOs .
Finally , to Question No 5 .
The campaign ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' , launched for the 2006 Football World Cup , was a good step towards raising awareness about trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation .
Although the assessment carried out by Germany shows that the fear of an increase in forced prostitution and trafficking did not materialise in 2006 , we welcome all initiatives aimed at informing public opinion , raising public awareness , preventing such heinous criminal phenomena and helping victims .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this coming Saturday the European Football Championship starts in Austria and Switzerland .
This is the second-largest sporting event after the World Cup .
It has been found that some 2.5 million sports fans from across Europe will attend the matches .
It has also been reported , however , that as happens at such major events , a large number of women , estimated at 25 000 , will travel from around the world to the cities where the matches are to be played , unfortunately not merely to support their teams , but because they are being forced into prostitution .
I am sure that the international community , and particularly the EU and the European Parliament , cannot be unmoved by this .
Madam President , Commissioner , as we have heard , the intervention by the European Parliament in 2006 in the similar case of the World Cup in Germany produced positive results .
At the time , the number of women reported to have been forced into prostitution was between 40 000 and 60 000 .
It would therefore be worthwhile for us to take action again , as we did back in 2006 as a result of the oral question by Mrs Wortmann-Kool .
I propose that the President of the European Parliament and the relevant Commissioner should send a letter , like the letter Mr Frattini sent to Angela Merkel in 2006 .
It should be addressed both to the organising committee and to UEFA , spelling out our concern over the danger threatening to transform a sporting event into uncontrolled entertainment with women as its victims .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am sure that if we are united and draw attention to what we are saying , we will avert dangers which do neither us nor society any credit , but rather allow the exploitation of human suffering .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , a few days before the European Football Championship gets under way , the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality - and I hope the entire European Parliament - is showing forced prostitution the red card once again .
Up to 800 000 women throughout the world become victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation every year .
This is one of the worst human rights violations today and even at major sporting events , quick sex around the venues of football matches is also linked to this modern-day slavery .
Two years ago at the football World Cup in Germany , we initiated a wide-ranging debate here in Parliament and launched a campaign to ensure that the huge wave of forced prostitution the experts initially feared and the corresponding negative spin-offs were able to be prevented thanks to the support of the fans through the opinioned public .
However , the subject then disappeared from sight again .
We have introduced legal initiatives and , with the experience we have gained from the German campaign , supported very extensively by the women 's organisations , have managed to set up victim protection measures and demonstrate the plight of the women who usually come from Central and Eastern Europe .
They are in dire straits as criminals on the one hand , since they do not have any residence permits , but as victims , on the other hand , because they are mercilessly exploited by the human traffickers .
We have moved on a step further with the victim protection measures , cross-border cooperation and the legitimate issuing of residence permits .
We now want to use the public at matches in Austria and Switzerland to highlight the subject again .
In Germany the Socialist Minister of Justice has announced draconian penalties for punters of forced prostitution .
There are still , however , many loopholes , and Parliament has to ensure that these loopholes are closed .
I would ask the Commission to support us in this .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( ET ) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there seems to be a symbolic significance to our discussing light-sensitive issues on a dark night .
Each year hundreds of thousands of women are abused in the European sex industry .
It is a rapidly growing industry bringing together new technology , criminality , narcotic drugs and big money , although its nature can be summed up in a single word : violence .
It is common knowledge that most women are lured into the sex trade because of poor social circumstances , chiefly poverty and unemployment .
Most prostitutes are from precisely those areas where unemployment is higher , which , where the European Union is concerned , means the poorer East European countries .
This shows that the European Union and Member States individually must act primarily to improve the vocational skills of women in at-risk groups and use active labour market measures in their regard .
There is no doubt that campaigns to raise awareness of the issue of prostitution , such as the ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' , are important and that for a certain period they affect society 's awareness of the issue .
I find , however , that the objective of forced prostitution and the commercial sexual exploitation of women needs constantly to be at the forefront of society 's and the public 's focus .
I find that fairly often , funding preventive measures is more effective and cheaper for the economy than constantly dealing with the consequences of the problem .
In addition to preventive measures , it is important to increase the effectiveness of police cooperation between the Member States , particularly in the Schengen Area .
I call on the Commission and the political parties represented here to be resolute and help make prostitution a thing of the past and support a ban on purchasing prostitution services in their home States .
Freezing demand will also lead to our achieving our ultimate objective .
Finally , it is also important to stress that there must be a zero-tolerance policy throughout the European Union on prostitution and human trafficking .
We should start to take decisions and act .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , we know that trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation has to be outlawed and combated throughout the world .
It is a scandal not worthy of a Europe of values and human rights .
We also know that trafficking in women no longer stops at borders .
We therefore need a European , a global response to the problem , but one that must go far beyond border controls and repression alone .
In principle it is a positive sign that this topic has been on the agenda for around 10 years , but the focus lies too one-sidedly on border controls ; prevention and victim protection are unfortunately neglected too much .
Nor is any all-clear being given .
More and more people - girls and women - are becoming victims of sexual exploitation although , as Mrs Gröner has already mentioned , there was no sign of the feared increase at the 2006 World Cup .
We do know , however , that the estimated number of unreported cases is high .
There are too few crackdowns against human traffickers and too few proceedings against unscrupulous criminals .
The European Commission has also confirmed this in response to a question I raised in Parliament .
We are focussing on better victim protection , not just in Germany , but in Europe .
In this regard I find it somewhat regrettable that the Commission can apparently find only fine words to say and is not really doing anything to improve matters .
How the Commission is agitating for the implementation of the Directive on protection of the victims of trafficking in the Member States is not transparent , nor is its implementation being monitored .
I find it extremely regrettable that the Commission merely points to a study in response to my second question in Parliament on how the Directive on protection of the victims of trafficking is implemented in Germany .
I would ask the Commission ultimately to take a very firm stand on whether the directive has been properly implemented , not only in Germany , but also in the other EU Member States .
It cannot therefore be true that the Commission does not know whether its own legislation has been properly implemented !
This would be a sign of inadequacy .
On migration , we should be looking not only at the subsequent migration of family members , but also at the possibilities of how women can migrate legally so that they do not have to place themselves in the hands of human traffickers .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( SV ) Madam President , hundreds of thousands of women and children are transported like commodities in the EU .
They are sexually exploited , ill-treated , threatened , used , and deprived of all human dignity .
What crime have they committed to be condemned to such an existence ?
Their crime is in fact poverty and lack of social rights and the fact that there are men who think that their money gives them the right to use women and children as commodities .
Usually young girls are enticed with false promises of jobs and good money , but then the nightmare begins .
To the shame of the EU and the Member States this trade is allowed to continue and , indeed , increase .
No one can fall back on the excuse that ' we knew nothing ' .
We know , but too little is done .
We must therefore get an answer from the Commission to our questions arising from the ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' campaign .
I maintain that the sex slave trade is a form of terrorism .
The EU and the Member States have been particularly effective in adopting more or less good measures to combat terrorism .
But this other terrorism which hurts women and children has not been given the same priority , either by the EU or the Member States .
We also need to realise that more and more men are becoming involved in this tragic trade .
Men must not only refrain from buying sexual services themselves .
They must also show other men that it is not OK to buy women 's bodies .
It is up to men to ensure that the demand , hence also the trade in women 's bodies , is reduced .
As long as there is a demand and a market with big financial gains , the trade will continue .
I repeat : women are not for sale .
We must put a stop to this .
( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the resolution on the future of professional football , which we adopted last year on these same benches , we expressly call on the Council to take measures to combat criminal activities in professional football , such as forced prostitution .
We literally said this in that text .
Just to be clear , it is not the fault of the football authorities that these phenomena occur on the margins of major tournaments .
They are almost characteristic of all large-scale international events .
However , the sporting world of course has every reason to want this problem tackled efficiently and thoroughly , because of course it makes little sense , ladies and gentlemen , for us to argue for and work towards more fair play in the stadiums and argue against and combat racism in the stations , if in and around the stadiums instances of slavery are tolerated .
The ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' campaign worked excellently during the 2006 World Cup in Germany .
Around 1 000 local and regional action groups and associations were involved in this prevention campaign , and that had a clear deterrent effect upon traffickers in human beings and other criminal networks .
The result - and the Commissioner has already referred to this - was that forced prostitution during the 2006 World Cup in Germany was limited to just a few tens of cases , and these were generally not directly related to the World Cup .
It is clear , therefore , that awareness raising and prevention campaigns work .
They are highly effective and we must therefore use them once again , including during the coming European championship that commences this week .
Therefore , Commissioner , we urge the European Commission to send a letter in this regard to the relevant governments , those of Austria and Switzerland , as Mrs Wortmann-Kool has just rightly stated .
I repeat our question .
Can you comply with our request and confirm here and now that you will support this initiative ?
I have one further comment to make : prevention alone will not suffice .
The Member States agreed in 2005 that they would prevent and combat trafficking in human beings but , at national level , the action plan you referred to , Commissioner , is more than ever a dead letter .
Now is the time , therefore , to remind the authorities of that action plan .
As much as two years ago , the Commissioner of the time , Mr Frattini , said that the role of Europol and Eurojust in this regard had to be strengthened , and Parliament expressly requested the same in its resolution .
We therefore also trust , Commissioner , that , in view of this tournament , the Commission and the Council will make greater efforts than ever to put these promises into practice .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , human trafficking , as we have heard , is a crime against humanity , especially against women - a new form of slavery and a highly profitable business , widely developed with an annual turnover of EUR 44 billion according to the OSCE .
It is worth discussing this at greater length as well as highlighting the various facets .
We are dealing today with trafficking in women and forced prostitution following the campaign we conducted at the 2006 World Cup in Germany .
There was also a report here in Parliament , which I was able to draw up , which dealt with forced prostitution and in which we requested various measures from the Commission .
The response was the action plan .
The question on implementation has already been asked repeatedly today and I should like to emphasise that it concerns residence permits for victims and training offensives at police training colleges , institutes for social studies and the like . It also concerns education in the countries of origin and educational and training opportunities for women locally as well as for young men .
They , too , are increasingly affected .
Obviously 18 October is EU Anti-Trafficking Day , which we were able to hold for the first time last year .
In other respects I still cannot see much sign of the campaign .
Regard for this subject has also declined since the Red Card campaign and the World Cup . We therefore want to give it another boost .
This is not about the ban on prostitution or discrimination against sex workers .
On the contrary !
It is about raising awareness and also seeking here to reject stigmatisation and building up a social network in order to protect sex workers in their trade as well .
Conviction of forced prostitution is vehement . The European Football Championship in Austria and Switzerland gives us the opportunity to draw attention to this .
I can guarantee that the Austrian authorities are taking the appropriate measures . They are pleased to invite you to a great European Championship and are hoping for fair play and fair sex .
( DE ) Madam President , many are delighted about the European Football Championship in June 2008 .
We should not forget , however , that aside from the matches , human trafficking , forced prostitution of women and child abuse are on the increase and the crimes committed by traffickers transcend all borders .
The matches will take place in Austria and Switzerland and the role of neighbouring Central European countries as transit countries is being strengthened for this extremely lucrative criminal trade .
The EU is being asked here for preventive measures , cross-border monitoring and law enforcement to be better organised and coordinated .
The European mechanisms for joint investigation must be improved .
Every Member State is being asked to protect victims more effectively and to actively make use of these instruments .
This is the only way that we will be able to catch the perpetrators out and show them the red card .
( PT ) It is vital that we take advantage of the Euro 2008 Championships to inform the general public once again that prostitution and the highly lucrative trafficking of women for the purpose of sexual exploitation are unacceptable , as they are forms of violence against women , girls and children .
For this reason , it is crucial that measures are taken to combat this trafficking effectively and at the same time to support victims of this situation in the various Member States , with information on the results of the actions carried out .
Yet we should not lose sight of the worsening inequalities , precarious and badly-paid work , unemployment and poverty that draw thousands of women and young girls into prostitution and that make the traffickers ' lives easier .
This therefore raises another question : how will EU leaders act to fight the fundamental causes of these serious breaches of the human rights of hundreds of thousands of women and young people so as to put an end to these new forms of slavery ?
( NL ) Madam President , during the 2006 World Cup , attention was also drawn to a helpline for victims of trafficking in women and forced prostitution .
In Turkey , for example , a helpline has already been active for some years now , which women can call to report cases of trafficking in women .
Back in 2006 , the European Parliament called for such a helpline to be set up that could speak to victims of human trafficking in several languages and offer assistance .
Even now , two years later , such a helpline has not been set up .
Two weeks ago , I attended the launch by Commissioner Kuneva of a helpline for disappointed consumers during Euro 2008 .
What a good initiative it was to set up a single telephone number .
It can be done , then , but why offer help to consumers and not to victims of trafficking in women ?
This new consumer line shows how quickly action can be taken and how little effort it can take .
Now it is time to combine these initiatives and provide the victims of trafficking in women with a means by which to ask for help .
To use the words of Barack Obama : ' We can do it , yes we can ' .
( SV ) Madam President , on Saturday the European football championship kicks off and the party can begin .
But there is a reverse side to the coin .
When sporting events of this magnitude take place , illegal trafficking in women and young girls for prostitution always increases .
It is therefore important for us to react , and act exactly as we did two years ago with the ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' campaign .
It is very important that we get together in the EU and work towards zero tolerance as regards trafficking in human beings .
I therefore appeal to all the EU governments which have not yet done so immediately to implement the action plan which the EU developed in 2005 to combat the sex slave trade .
I wish that more countries had legislation on buying sex , for it has a clear preventive effect in curbing the sex slave trade .
In addition , I look forward to the report which the Commission is to present on patterns of prostitution in the Member States , and I hope that we shall soon be able to study it .
I want the European football championship , both on and off the pitch , to be imbued with the values which are the lifeblood of sport : comradeship , healthy activity and fair play .
Not to condemn reprehensible trafficking in human beings for prostitution is to give it indirect support .
Madam President , trafficking may be an illegal market , but is nonetheless a market , having both a supply and a demand side .
A country where there is significant demand plays an equally active part in trafficking as an origin country .
Besides being a leftover of slavery in our times , trafficking constitutes continued defiance and infringement of the law and is linked to other criminal practices , such as money laundering , violence , smuggling , prostitution , tax evasion , fraud and forced labour .
Trafficking produces dangerous reversals within the order of values in our society , preserving old inequalities - women and children are seen as merchandise - and generating new ones .
The money that traffickers earn undermines the belief in the value of labour and fair business .
It is necessary for all Member States urgently to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Trafficking and to apply the measures they have agreed , starting with combating the root cause of trafficking for prostitution , which is male demand for women and girls .
( SK ) With the arrival of the UEFA Euro 2008 Championship , starting in Austria and Switzerland this coming Saturday , we are again reminded of the subject of forced prostitution .
Those who appreciate good football will definitely have a great time .
Unfortunately , these sporting events also provide fertile ground for mafia activities , and pose a higher than usual risk of increased trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation .
I agree with the other speakers that the so-called ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' campaign , launched by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in March 2006 , was successful because it brought out into the open one of the most burning social issues .
I am convinced that only a good information campaign during the Euro 2008 Championship about the need to prevent trafficking in women and forced prostitution will open the eyes of the public and expose this horrible type of violence against girls and women .
( DA ) Madam President , I have a direct question for the Commission regarding what specific initiatives have been taken to prevent trafficking in women in connection with the Euro 2008 Championship in Austria and Switzerland .
After all , we have heard here this evening , and past experience has taught us , that trafficking in women takes place in connection with this kind of major sporting event .
I have the following questions . Firstly , have the governments of the two countries been approached and asked to support Parliament 's ' Red Card to Forced Prostitution ' campaign ?
Secondly , has their attention been drawn to the need to intensify police efforts in connection with the championship ? Finally , have the two governments been called on to take action to support the victims ?
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , as many speakers have said - and as I also mentioned - similar initiatives and proposals were tabled and actions were adopted by Parliament and the Commission before the 2006 World Cup organised in Germany .
Fortunately , the concerns and fears of the German authorities and the European institutions did not materialise .
But that is certainly not a reason to draw the conclusion that we should not do anything now and that we can sit on our hands .
It is more than reasonable to have this debate , because it is certainly better to be on the safe side and to be better prepared than necessary ; it is also reasonable to make use of this opportunity to take stock of the actions , and to enable Parliament to make suggestions to the Commission , and it is also a good opportunity to raise public awareness .
I do understand the dissatisfaction of a number of speakers .
In my introductory remarks I mentioned how many concrete reports the Commission launched and we are expecting the studies and the conclusions which are being drawn up , on which further actions and further action programmes can be based .
Mrs Bozkurt mentioned the issue of hotlines and I think it is a good idea , though it is not so easy to achieve .
As far as the other hotline of consumer protection is concerned , it is a very different issue .
So I do not think that this hotline established or initiated by my fellow Commissioner Mrs Kuneva could be used , for instance , for victim protection , because it is a very different issue .
It is much more complicated .
Mrs Breyer also mentioned victim protection which I think is a very important key issue .
I would like to point out that there will be a specific chapter on victim assistance in the evaluation and monitoring report of the action plan , which will be ready by October or November 2008 , and we will assess the real implementation of measures to protect victims .
On the first EU anti-trafficking day which was on 18 October 2007 , GLS issued recommendations on victim identification and referral services .
I want to assure you that we are determined to ensure appropriate follow-up and I want to assure Members of Parliament that the Commission is ready to intensify the fight against trafficking , against forced prostitution and the organised crime behind it .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow , Thursday , at 11 a.m.
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - As football fans all over Europe await the opening of Euro 2008 it is time to reflect on the dangers to women , especially from the former Soviet Republics , who will be victims of trafficking and subject to the ordeal of forced prostitution in order to meet demand for sexual services at the venues of the football matches .
What will be a wonderful celebration of the best European sporting traditions for many will also be a time of physical and psychological suffering for those unfortunate young women who , in their naivety , believe that the attractive jobs they are being offered in the hospitality sector will be limited to work as waitresses or behind a bar .
It is time to reiterate the call for the remaining 17 Member States of the European Union who have so far failed to ratify the European Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings to do so without further delay .
EU Member States who champion human rights causes can surely offer no excuse for failing to adopt this Convention , which was adopted in Warsaw over three years ago .
in writing . - Could the Commission clarify to Parliament what progress it has made on the 2005 plan to combat and prevent trafficking of humans in Europe ?
Concerned by the delay of implementation of this plan by Member States , I ask that the Commission state the impact this could have on the campaign ' Red Card to forced prostitution ' in Member States .
Could it also inform us what campaign it is putting in place to raise awareness of trafficking for prostitution during the UEFA 2008 games ?
I am deeply concerned that , whilst sporting events bring joy to millions worldwide , they are also ruthlessly being used as an opportunity to exploit women and girls .
I am shocked that around 100 000 women are trafficked in Europe annually for prostitution .
What I condemn the most is that girls as young as 14 are affected .
We simply cannot let this form of modern day slavery continue .
Not only is sexual exploitation a crime , it is also a gross violation of human rights .
in writing . - ( HU ) The Union is responsible for preventing by all possible means the sexual exploitation and people trafficking that emerge at sporting events organised on its territory .
The 2008 European football championship is a sporting event that brings together a significant number of people , during which there is a temporary rise in demand for sexual services .
It is therefore of fundamental importance that we protect ourselves using temporary campaigns such as those initiated by Mrs Záborská during the 2006 football World Cup , which also deserve to be continued this time .
However , in order for the initiative to reach as many people as possible , I feel that there needs to be more widespread publicity in the media ( including on the official website for the European Championship ) , with the participation of politicians , sports directors , sportsmen and supporters ( modelled on the ' Youth Voices Against Racism ' programme ) .
However , a temporary campaign is not enough in itself .
In order to take decisive action against people trafficking , directives need to be created , but above all it is necessary to comply with those that already exist , as soon as possible .
I would like to draw the Commission 's attention to the fact that many countries are suffering from shortcomings in transposing and interpreting Directives , and so their implementation is being delayed ever further .
For this reason , I feel it is particularly important that we receive an accurate answer to Mrs Záborská 's question relating to Directive 2004 / 81 / EC .
Even if border controls play an important role in filtering out sexual exploitation and people trafficking from sporting events that take place in the Union , I feel that we can achieve this not by making internal border controls more stringent but by reinforcing external controls in appropriate cooperation with border guards .
In this way , we will not make it more difficult for law-abiding citizens to participate in European events !
in writing . - ( HU ) Ladies and gentlemen , allow me to follow Mrs Záborská 's question by again drawing your attention to the defencelessness of Roma women in the areas of people trafficking and forced prostitution .
Social exclusion and , frequently , a lack of official documents make Roma girls particularly vulnerable and ' easy targets ' for those who profit from people trafficking .
Their situation is exacerbated by the racial prejudice they face from the whole of society , the sexual prejudice that appears in their own communities , and the general mistrust that the Roma have of the justice system .
Individual programmes are needed to help those who have become victims of people trafficking , and their families , and to prevent adolescent girls from being forced to live and work in an exploitative environment .
The creation of more advisory networks and centres is essential , both on the part of NGOs and of Member States , as well as the gathering and analysis of reliable statistical data on the relationship between Roma communities and people trafficking .
In this latter area , some NGOs and international organisations can demonstrate some results , but a greater role also needs to be assumed by the European Commission and the Member States .
However , the main breeding ground for people trafficking and sexual exploitation is the poverty that reduces human life into an everyday struggle for survival , in which the danger of illegal activities grows significantly in the absence of financial and educational opportunities .
For this reason , in addition to programmes to raise awareness and helping those who have already become victims , putting an end to inhuman poverty is our primary common duty .

( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the ECURIE System - the European Community security system - was triggered yesterday following an undefined incident in a Slovenian nuclear power station .
The alert was subsequently called off , but doubts persist as to the true nature of the incident and the reasons for this highly unusual alert .
We therefore wish to make the most of the fact that the Commission will be present later on today , and that Slovenia holds the presidency , to call upon the presidency and the Commission to inform the European Parliament , and hence the public , of the real reasons why this utterly abnormal procedure occurred .
I should be grateful , Madam President , if you would act on this request .
I think that the Slovenian Presidency , which will be here today , will come back to this request .
The Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean ( debate )
The next item is the Commission statement on the Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I think I should speak French today , so that is what I will do .
I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament for having included this item on our relations with our Mediterranean partners in this sitting 's agenda .
That has given rise to a debate on a subject that is vitally important for Europe and I would especially like to congratulate the European Parliament on its role in recent years because its interest in the Mediterranean has never waned .
The Barcelona Process has enabled us to tackle numerous regional issues of strategic importance and , naturally , a number of political issues .
I believe that we have achieved a great deal , although many common challenges remain , including security , environmental protection , ensuring sustainable energy supply , combating organised crime , controlling migratory flows and intercultural dialogue .
In addition to this cooperation with our Mediterranean neighbours , I would like us to strengthen our understanding of one another and our interests , respect as well as mutual trust .
In March the European Council invited the Commission to redefine the modalities of the ' Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean ' and on 20 May the Commission adopted a communication underlining the central role of the Mediterranean , its historical and contemporary importance , and the considerable challenges of our common future .
However , I should point out that we still have the European Neighbourhood Policy of course , which is a bilateral policy while the other is a regional policy .
We also need to take account of the fact that the existing action plans effectively implement the decisions taken by the various sectoral ministerial meetings .
When we think about the Mediterranean , we think about the cradle of the three monotheistic religions , the melting pots of civilisation and culture , migration and trade .
We think about the history of the Mediterranean , a history that is inseparable from the history of Europe .
The Mediterranean Basin is effectively the bridge between the North and the South , the East and the West , and , situated at the point where three continents converge , it is more than just a border for the European Union .
Stability in that region is crucial for our security and our prosperity , not to mention the security and prosperity of our Mediterranean neighbours and friends .
It is only through determined and realistic political action , combined with a strong and tireless commitment and constructive dialogue , that we will be able to tackle these challenges together .
The Commission has always called for a stronger , more open and more constructive relationship with our Mediterranean partners , and we are putting forward concrete proposals to achieve this .
Ladies and gentlemen , allow me to outline for you today the main observations and proposals in the communication that I presented to the Commission .
The Barcelona Process has unfortunately suffered as a result of the ongoing conflicts in the Southern Mediterranean and , at times , from the lack of cooperation between the various partners .
A positive change is taking place , however , and I saw this myself during my recent visits to the region .
The time has come to take advantage of a renewed political will to breathe new life into our cooperation to ensure that it is more balanced and more in tune with our fellow citizens .
In our opinion , there are three key objectives .

The first is to upgrade the political level of the European Union 's relationship with its Mediterranean partners ; the second is to provide more co-ownership to our multilateral relations ; and the third is to make these relations more concrete and more visible through additional regional and sub-regional projects , relevant for the people of the region .
These measures would bring great added value .
Naturally , private funds will come into play : hitherto only the Community sector has been involved , so the private sector will now play a role .
We will of course have to see whether this really works , but that is the idea in any case .
It is therefore essential to upgrade the level of our relations .
The Commission proposes organising biennial summits of the heads of state or government .
It would be difficult to understand why we hold regular summits with our major partners throughout the world without having a forum for talks between the EU heads of state and our Mediterranean neighbours and friends .
In addition , the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly has reaffirmed itself as the parliamentary dimension of the Barcelona Process .
It provides a framework of debate , open dialogue and free exchange of views .
It gives impetus to the partnership by adopting resolutions and recommendations , and it will be the legitimate parliamentary representation of the Union for the Mediterranean .
The Commission unreservedly supports the strengthening of the role of the Parliamentary Assembly in relations with the Mediterranean partners .
Increased co-ownership is also essential .
Over the past few years , one important shared belief was that the agenda of the Barcelona Process was influenced by the fact that the EU presidency also held the presidency of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership .

Three proposals have received the general support of the partners : the establishment of a co-presidency , with one co-president from a Southern country and one from a Northern country ; the establishment of a Joint Permanent Committee , based in Brussels and responsible for governance ; and the establishment of a secretariat responsible for the promotion of the projects .
Finally , as Robert Schuman said , we must set up concrete projects ' which first create a de facto solidarity ' .
It is the quality of the projects that we carry out together that will guarantee the success of the initiative .
That is what enables the citizens to feel the force of the links that unite both shores of the Mediterranean .
The projects must add structure to the region and provide for the participation of non-State actors , civil society and businesses .
Europe must act as a lever for private capital , an intermediary .
The Commission is provisionally proposing the promotion of coastal motorways , the linking-up of the trans-Maghreb Motorway , solar energy and de-pollution of the Mediterranean .
Of course , this list is non exhaustive and other projects will follow .
In conclusion , Madam President , I would like to emphasise one point that , in my view , is crucial .
This renewed cooperation with our partners in the South must in no way detract from our solid links and policies with our neighbours to the East .
On the contrary , in addition to our efforts to strengthen the individual links with our friends in the East , the Commission is enhancing regional cooperation with its ' Black Sea Synergy ' initiative .
We will soon publish the annual report to celebrate the first anniversary of its launch and at that stage we will be able to discuss the recent Polish and Swedish initiative .
Through these efforts , in the East and in the South , we will be able to stick to our goal : enhancing our relations through flexible cooperation instruments focusing on the priorities of our partners .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Paris summit is a real opportunity to bring a new dimension to our relations with our Mediterranean partners .
Although we cannot ignore the lessons of the past , we must not remain a prisoner of them .
The ' Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean ' initiative is going to launch a new era in our relations with our Southern neighbours , a new partnership , based on successful elements of the Barcelona Process , with a view to moving forward together to achieve our common objectives of peace , democracy and prosperity .
Excuse me , Madam President , if I have spoken for too long , but I believe that this is a crucial subject , for me and for us all .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my Group awaited today 's statement by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner with great interest .
I should like to thank her again and say that the Commission 's communication , adopted on 20 May , made very interesting reading .
We applaud President Sarkozy for having started the ball rolling , for having aroused the interest of the European Council and for having prompted a renewal of our Mediterranean policy , which my Group supports and hopes will prove tangible and rapid .
We know how difficult it is to pursue the ambitious goals of the Barcelona Process .
On the one hand there is the unresolved Middle East conflict and tension in the Western Sahara .
There is also the gap that sometimes separates us from the democratic , economic and social models of our partner countries , hampering attainment of the goals we have set ourselves .
All of this is serious and makes matters difficult , but should not constitute a pretext to justify delays or changes of mind .
We believe that President Sarkozy 's political initiative and the backing provided by the European Commission go in the right direction , namely that of lending substance and reality to our political aspirations .
To this end the Commission has identified four projects , recalled by our Commissioner this morning , in addition to the activities already planned : motorways of the seas , depollution of the Mediterranean , environmental management , civil protection cooperation to tackle natural disasters and , lastly , a solar energy programme for the Mediterranean .
Each of these projects is important , and rather than dwelling on them now we shall do so once the Commission has provided more details .
These are projects which , if carried out , will act as an incredibly important driving force , both to give the Barcelona Process a new lease of life and to complement measures already under way but not yet completed .
I would recall the free trade area planned for 2010 : we should like to know more about this , Commissioner , as well as about the state of play on the objectives set out in the association agreements and other ongoing projects .
To conclude , as concerns tangible projects to be completed within a reasonable time frame , I would also recall that , as well as the infrastructure of the seas and the North-South link , fresh impetus is also needed for a South-South motorway corridor connecting the countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean ; this system must in addition be interconnected with Europe .
Lastly , there needs to be a loan scheme providing help on issues such as water and infrastructure in the Middle East .
Finally , I wish to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to two issues .
The first concerns the administration and operation of the Euro-Mediterranean Assembly .
The European Union has also made major commitments in the Middle East , and we expect these commitments to be followed up with political action .
Can the Council tell us what real , practical prospects there are of such action ?
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not agree with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that it is appropriate to speak French this morning .
( FR ) Along with my mother tongue , it is my favourite language , Commissioner , but I think that this morning in particular it is inappropriate to speak in French because President Sarkozy 's mistake from the outset was to give the impression that the Union for the Mediterranean was a Franco-French idea .
However , he has since become more reasonable , and that is why he must be congratulated , Mr Bonsigniore .
( DE ) May I also remind you that when Mr Sarkozy came to the House right at the beginning , in order to introduce the idea of the Mediterranean Union to the Conference of Presidents for the first time , I asked him : ' Can you tell me which role the Federal Republic of Germany should play in your Mediterranean Union ? ' , and he answered : ' Le statut d 'un observateur ' .
We have moved on in the meantime and have clarified these issues .
That is why the approach that you have described , Commissioner , is the right one .
I am firmly convinced that there are three central challenges that we have to deal with in the framework of the Mediterranean Union .
First of all , I think social stability is the precondition for peace , but nowhere in the North or the South is social stability at greater risk than in the Mediterranean region .
Nowhere else is the direct clash between immense wealth , on the one hand , and immense poverty , on the other , greater or more visible - indeed , tangible - than in the Mediterranean region , and nowhere are the confrontation and the ensuing tensions for us Europeans greater than in the Mediterranean .
That being the case , the Mediterranean Union is a project which could lead to more peace and stability via the economic integration of our two regions , so it is an extremely good idea , and it is one which we Socialists therefore fully endorse .
Secondly , what makes this an even more appealing concept is that it makes multilateralism the basis of cooperation , not only within the framework of the Mediterranean Union but also as a project of regional cooperation , which cannot act as a model for the world but could give rise to joint initiatives which could contribute to greater stability on a global level as well .
The third point which is so important for us Socialists is that we have managed to avoid creating any parallel processes .
The Barcelona Process - for which , incidentally , a sum of around EUR 15.5 billion is made available in the financial perspective to 2013 - was , after all , also launched for the reasons which I have just outlined and which formed the political basis for the Mediterranean Union .
Through the Mediterranean Union , the Barcelona Process is now being taken to another level . It is being strengthened and stepped up , but without any new institutions being created outside the existing EU institutions .
That being the case , the Commission 's role and also our role as Parliament - and , incidentally , the role of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly as well - is a special role . It is a role which has already been defined and which does not need or demand any new institutions or more red tape .
In political , institutional and economic terms , and in terms of the practical objectives set , we are now on the right track with the Mediterranean Union .
I think that gives cause for celebration on 14 July in Paris as well .

on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , with his proposals for a Mediterranean Union , President Sarkozy recognised what many knew yet would not admit : that the Barcelona Process - top-down and driven by European interests - was dead in the water , leading our southern partners to opt out and a widening prosperity gap to emerge on either side of the Mediterranean .
If Europe is serious about reversing the failures of the last decade and generating development and security on its southern shores we must now learn to give as well as take .
We must build on the ashes of the Barcelona Process - a true partnership based on trust , reciprocity and , above all , mutual respect .
The Mediterranean must not be a cultural dividing line but a meeting place .
Joint investment in infrastructure - such as ports , sea links and energy grids - will bring our peoples together far more effectively than the high-sounding declarations which characterised the Barcelona Process .
We need investment in people too .
The kind of energy which brought together the French and Germans after the last big war must be invested in bringing Europeans and North Africans together to prevent the next .
The worst possible mistake the French Presidency could make is to commit the European Union - and by extension its citizens - to a grandiose project without providing finance for such cooperation for a number of years down the line .
And , as Mr Schulz said , creating a full-blown bureaucratic structure alongside the standing delegations and the External Action Service need not be the way ; a focus on values must be .
Despite the worsening situation , particularly in Egypt and Israel , and the fact that we claim such values as the basis of EU foreign policy , references to human rights are mysteriously hard to find in the Commission 's proposals .
I hope this is something the Commission will look at .
But , these objections aside , Liberals and Democrats are pleased to show support for this Union for the Mediterranean , with one important caveat : pragmatic cooperation on economic issues must not be a substitute for promoting peace in the Middle East through the common foreign and security policy envisaged in the Lisbon Treaty .
Since the Commissioner recognises the link between economic development and peace , what would be a better sign of peace and goodwill towards our Arab neighbours than abolishing agricultural tariffs ?
Our much-vaunted free trade agreements have failed to boost living standards because they excluded agriculture and services , which account for two thirds of the GDP in the Middle East and North Africa .
If we do not take the produce of these countries , we will end up taking their people .
Reforming the CAP , providing a level playing field for goods from the Southern Mediterranean , would go a long way towards tackling the causes of record migration into Europe .
As the inimitable Doctor Johnson once said ' Life cannot subsist ... but by reciprocal concessions ' .
And , for the sake of the success of this Union , Europe must make the first move .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , the European Commission has put forward a good proposal .
It has transformed a relatively clumsy political initiative - the ' Union for the Mediterranean ' - into a renewed political ambition for a strengthened Barcelona Process .
That is an excellent thing and , in this context , the Commission is performing its role to the letter .
We support its proposals , particularly as regards incorporating the institutions of the future project in relation to the Lisbon Treaty and its goal of a more coherent and better integrated external policy for the Union .
In so doing , it is putting an end to the justified fears of ad hoc political manoeuvring dictated by the agreements reached at the summit or on an à la carte or circumstantial basis , fears fuelled largely by the misplaced initiatives of President Sarkozy to promote , for example , the proliferation of nuclear power in the region .
The mediocre results in terms of democracy and human rights were unanimously identified in 2005 as an obstacle to the Barcelona objectives .
That is why the European Parliament insists that all the mechanisms aimed at strengthening democracy and the rule of law as well as the parliamentary dimension of the process and the participation of civil society must be duly guaranteed within the framework of this new ambition for the Euro-Mediterranean region .
An amendment has been tabled on the conflict in the Middle East .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think that the European Parliament would be well-advised to accept it .
It is right to ensure that new initiatives in the region are not dependent on resolution of the conflict , but we would also be fooling ourselves if we ignored its negative impact on the concrete capacities to develop Mediterranean projects that are relevant to the citizens .
Moreover , the ad hoc delegation that recently visited Palestine documented serious violations of humanitarian law and human rights , clear violations of the Oslo and Annapolis commitments .
It would be futile to suggest that the persistence of this situation does not undermine profoundly the mutual trust between the partners and the civil societies in the region , trust that is nonetheless vital to the success of our Euro-Mediterranean ambitions .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Madam President , the European Union has many so-called old neighbours to the South and many so-called new ones to the East .
As far as the former are concerned , there exists an instrument for external cooperation which is currently being strengthened .
This strengthening process should continue , but it will not lead to any of the countries concerned joining the Union .
In the case of our Eastern neighbours involved in the Neighbourhood Policy , membership of the Union is most certainly a possibility .
Membership is not the aim of effective cooperation , but a successful neighbourhood policy is bound to lead in that direction .
The Barcelona Process needs new political impetus , because the ' one size fits all ' Neighbourhood Policy fits neither the East nor the West .
It is therefore entirely appropriate that two projects appeared on the European agenda at almost the same time , one concerning a Mediterranean Union and the other an Eastern partnership .
As a neighbour of Ukraine , Belarus , Moldova and Georgia I very much hope that no damaging competition will arise between the Southern and Eastern neighbourhood policies .
The two should instead be mutually complementary .
If we are to be successful in budgetary negotiations , for example , we need to stand shoulder to shoulder .
Mutual political solidarity is called for when designing the eastern and southern aspects of neighbourhood policy .
A level playing field is also urgently required at institutional , political , assistance and economic level regarding our policy towards the South and the East .
That is why I am today strongly supporting strengthening and renewal of the political framework for neighbourhood as regards the Mediterranean countries .
We support the projects relating to credits , communication and energy .
We also support institutional reforms affecting the South .
We trust that in the future similar support will be offered for strengthening policy towards the East .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , the challenges involved in Europe 's relationship with the people of the southern shore of the Mediterranean far exceed those of a simple neighbourhood relationship .
It is perhaps a peaceful future that hangs in the balance in this region of unparalleled division .
The reasons for this situation are very clear to see .
The first is the economic imbalance .
Thirteen years after the launch of the Barcelona Process , not only has the promised shared prosperity not materialised ; the gaps have grown wider .
In fact , the obsession with free trade has taken precedence over the goal of development .
In order to succeed tomorrow where we failed yesterday , a change of direction is needed .
I do not see this , however .
The second problem is the humiliating treatment of migrants .
The population of these countries is very young .
The people want to live yet they do not see any future .
Although they are deeply attached to their land , their culture , the history of their civilisation and its impressive contributions - all due respect to Mr Berlusconi - many of them are looking to Europe and they see their emigrant brothers and sisters suffering the affronts of which we are all aware : from profiling to discrimination , from detention centres to ' refoulement ' .
In this regard , too , the gap has increased dramatically .
Talking about a dialogue of cultures and bringing the people closer together without putting an end to these practices has absolutely no credibility whatsoever .
Finally , there is Europe 's inertia regarding the Palestinian problem .
There will be the retort that the Union and its Member States are Palestine 's largest donors ; that is true and it is a good thing .
However , any observer will confirm , as the EP delegation that has just returned from the Middle East has just done , that without a firm European commitment on a political level , this aid will resolve none of the real issues .
In other words , what is expected of Europe in the Southern Mediterranean in this respect is that it finally overcomes what the former representative of the United Nations Secretary-General , Mr de Soto , quite rightly called self-censorship with regard to Israel and the persistent violations of international law and its own commitments .
Israel must understand - and it is the Union 's duty to help with this - that the normalisation of its relations with the region as a whole has a price , and that price is no more or no less than what is stipulated in the Peace Initiative of the Arab League , the Quartet 's Roadmap or the Annapolis Declaration , namely the end of the occupation and resulting barbarism , and the recognition of the Palestinian State within the borders as they stood in 1967 .
Europe 's attitude to this matter is perhaps the decisive criterion in the success or failure of any attempt to relaunch the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership .
It is therefore recommended that the European Union-Israel Association Council meeting on 16 June give serious consideration to this when examining the Israeli request for the status of its partnership with the Union to be upgraded .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , I have been asked to speak today on Euromed .
This is the insane attempt to create a pan-Mediterranean bloc , joining Europe with north Africa .
To the architects of this scheme , it was a brilliant idea : Europe would transfer wealth and technology to north Africa and north Africa would transfer cheap labour and oil and gas to Europe .
In reality , it is a disastrous idea .
We have already seen what happens when you allow people from poor countries to have freedom of movement into richer ones .
Can you imagine how much more true this will be if north Africa gets this right too ?
At a time of heightened international terrorism , is it a good idea to have freedom of movement from countries with known al-Qa 'ida presences ?
After the terrorist atrocities in Madrid and London , one would have thought Europe would have learned its lessons .
Clearly not !
Let us also talk about oil and gas .
The north African countries know Europe can be bullied .
Is it really a good idea to put our energy security in the hands of the military dictatorship in Algeria or Colonel Gadaffi in Libya , both of whom are aware of our vulnerability ?
I strongly urge the EU to cease this scheme .
We have already had one imperial mare nostrum .
We do not need another .

( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , the Mediterranean is the region of all divisions : geographical divisions , historical divisions - in Salamin , Axion , Lepanto - demographic divisions and even philosophical divisions , between magical thinking and logical thinking , in other words the Orient and the Occident , but also the East and West , from the Egypt of Moses , then Jesus , then Mohammed , from Omar Khayyam to Baudelaire , from the plateaus of Syria to the plains of Languedoc .
The Mediterranean is the hope of three monotheistic religions and the civilisation of wheat and wine , not of sauerkraut and beer or mussels in Chez Léon .
The Union for the Mediterranean is not just a matter of de-pollution or civil security .
What you need for that is the fire brigade !
The Mediterranean is not managed by 44 senior officials in Brussels , capital of the Mediterranean .
Why not also have an Erasmus grant so that Plato and Aristotle can come and study Community law in the Bruges College ?

The Mediterranean manages the affairs of the women and men of the Mediterranean : in other words prosperity , for example , of fishermen , who are asking you for it at the moment ; in other words peace in the West , in the Saharan provinces of Morocco , and in the East , in Palestine .
Commissioner , Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , our dreams need to be big enough for us not to lose sight of them when pursuing them , and that is why there is not a restricted union of the people of the Mediterranean .
( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Mediterranean has played a part in Europe 's external relations since the beginning of European unification .
Even the Treaty of Rome anticipated preferential relations with certain Mediterranean countries .
The politics of the Mediterranean and the international situation have helped to develop our institutional framework because the region has always been an arena for international challenges and problems .
As is universally recognised , we did not reach the ambitious targets we set in Barcelona in 1995 , so we set new ones in 2005 .
Our Euro-Mediterranean relations have undoubtedly given us numerous opportunities for meetings and familiarisation both bilaterally and internationally to improve contacts with the public and with parliaments .
President Sarkozy 's proposed Union for the Mediterranean , and its progress under the aegis of the EU and its institutions , have highlighted how urgent it is to realise the Euro-Mediterranean dream , which has become more real and advanced on both sides .
The dream has made an important contribution .
The Mediterranean has been ever present in our questions , changes and plans ; it has been key in the EU 's balance of power and relationships .
The progress this proposal represents is also proof of the mobilisation , innovation and commitment the Union is capable of in the face of major challenges .
I congratulate and thank the European Commission , particularly Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for her work and her proposal , which in our view is balanced and integrated .
Her proposal makes the most of our commitments and vested interests ; it builds on the new French proposals and paves the way ahead .
Through the joint resolution , the European Parliament welcomes and supports these efforts .
It will lend its support to the interesting and ambitious project which has begun .
The challenges in the region are becoming ever greater and more urgent .
There are deep economic and political differences , serious security problems and economic inequalities .
Additionally , the economic and political environment of the Mediterranean is becoming increasingly complex .
The US as well as China and Russia have to be taken into account , so we must become more prudent and effective .
( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament wished to react immediately to the Commission 's communication .
This is because , as the Commissioner herself said , we are keen to see a revival , renewal and development of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership .
We support the Commission 's view that the European Union should be the key institutional and political player - on the European side - in building the Union for the Mediterranean .
This may also encourage our partners in the South to cooperate more closely among themselves , something that has hitherto proved exceedingly difficult .
We agree that the task of the Union for the Mediterranean should be economic and territorial integration among the countries of the Mediterranean Basin , to be brought about by means of major infrastructure projects , and we also believe that the examples put forward by the Commission are appropriate .
For this purpose , however , it must be clear who does what .
Above all , any overlap between the role of the Commission and that of the prospective secretariat must be avoided .
As for the revival of the partnership , we are of course keen to bolster its political dimension : we are interested not just in dialogue between governments but in the role of parliaments , in the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliament and in its work and that of civil society , where I would strongly emphasise that the social partners play a fundamental role .
Finally , it must be clear that the projects set out in the Commission 's communication should not be carried out to the detriment of regional programmes already under way in the culture , heritage , training and audiovisual fields .
In this regard we would appeal for the Erasmus Mundus programme to be better resourced and for the Euromed Audiovisual programme to be refinanced .
( FR ) Madam President , welcome thus to the relaunch , 13 years later , of the process governing the multilateral relations between the European Union and the countries bordering the Mediterranean .
Our resolution makes no mistake .
There was no misplaced initiative .
On the contrary , there was a timely and welcome initiative : a new initiative , new impetus , new momentum .
That proves that it was at least possible to perfect the Barcelona Process and we will all focus our efforts in that direction .
Welcome thus to this ' Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean ' .
It is nevertheless the first time that the instrument has been given priority over the objective .
I have no doubt that the Union for the Mediterranean will remain as a generic name , but I do not want to fall out with anyone .
The Union for the Mediterranean is the egg of Columbus , is it not !
The Mediterranean is a lake .
We all live on its shores ; some are organised , others are less so or not at all - such as the Southern countries - but we must work together .
In this respect , we must begin - and the Commission underlined this perfectly - with specific projects relating to pollution , energy production and jobs for young people , which are essential for the Mediterranean countries .
Welcome , too , to the parliamentary relaunch in less tangible fields , in human rights , in gender issues .
However , I must conclude by saying that there will surely be no need for a third relaunch .
We absolutely have to succeed this time because if we do not we would be showing ourselves to be enemies of our own interests .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a great deal has been said about the French President 's idea to equip and arm the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with a nuclear capability for civilian but also military use within the framework of the Mediterranean Union .
Let me quote Asterix the Gaul here : ' They must be crazy , the French ! '
However , I am now even more concerned about this development , given that these plans have been taken up and are fervently supported by the European Commission as well .
Around two weeks ago , a meeting took place between Dr Mohamed ElBaradei , Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , and the Commission .
Mr Barroso was in attendance .
An agreement was signed between the IAEA and Euratom , or the Commission , which aims to drive forward the proliferation of nuclear energy .
There is apparently a desire to equip the same developing countries that Mr Sarkozy has his eye on , and put them on track and support them in all manner of ways so that they can deploy nuclear energy .
This raises a great many questions , in my view .
First of all , Commissioner , you were originally supposed to be a co-signatory of this agreement .
I have the relevant draft agreement available to me .
Why did you distance yourself from it ?
Could this be because there is actually no basis for this agreement in the Treaties ?
Secondly , what is Mr Solana 's position on the signing of this type of agreement ?
I cannot imagine that from a security perspective , and especially in view of the difficult situation with Iran , this agreement could possibly gain Europe 's backing .
Since this all appears to have taken place in secret , I would be very pleased to receive an explanation from the Commissioner , particularly as she comes from a country , namely Austria , which has a highly critical stance towards nuclear matters .
( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Schulz will be pleased to hear that I do not intend to speak French .
That , however , does not prevent me from unreservedly backing President Sarkozy 's initiative , which has pushed - or even propelled - Europe into a position from where it can reclaim a vital role in the Mediterranean area .
The merit of the Sarkozy initiative is that it responds to the question of outcomes from the Barcelona Process in anything but a tame manner .
Whenever we ask ourselves what the Mediterranean has gained from the Barcelona Process , our objective , serious and truthful answer is inevitably unsatisfactory .
There has of course been the war , and there is still conflict in the Middle East .
When it was decided in Barcelona in 1995 to launch this new European policy , the idea was to manage the post-conflict peace .
That was not the case then and is not now .
Europe is still dragging its feet , and the French President 's initiative strikes us as well-timed .
We endorse the Commission 's initiative and the compromise which has emerged from it .
We back it , yet we believe that it is still insufficient with regard to the role that Europe can and must play in the Mediterranean .
Some people feared , and still fear , that the French initiative might jeopardise European cohesion ; I do not believe there is any such danger .
No such danger exists whenever Europe is asked to focus more on politics and less on the market .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , today 's debate is crucial .
One of the keys to the future of our continent lies in our capacity to prevent a deep split from dividing the Mediterranean Basin into two antagonistic sides , culturally and economically .
In spite of all the differences between the two shores of the mare nostrum , what unites us is even stronger than what separates us .
That is why Nicolas Sarkozy 's initiative is excellent in principle : it breathes new life into a Barcelona Process that is marking time .
I do have some reservations about the method , however .
When France signed up to the European commitments in the various Treaties , from Maastricht to Lisbon , it agreed to transfer to the Community - and this is something I regret - a number of its prerogatives , notably in the area of foreign affairs .
With all due respect to Mr Guénot , that is unfortunately the world in which these Treaties oblige us to live .
That is why , in my opinion , it is somewhat inconsistent to launch such a project , to great media hullabaloo .
In reality , France no longer has the power to force it on anyone .
The only way to move it forward was to make use of all of the diplomatic and human resources available to France to convince its partners to carry out the reform of the Barcelona Process , without giving the impression of undoing what had already been achieved , even if what existed was far from satisfactory .
The result of this inconsistency can be seen today because it is certainly no coincidence that this debate was postponed from yesterday , when the Council could have taken part , to this morning , when only the Commission is represented .
This must be more than a sign : the Commission has no intention of relinquishing this matter .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , I am pleased today that the ' Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean ' is at the top of the European agenda .
The Commission 's analysis seems to be pertinent .
Based on the acquis of the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation undertaken since 1995 , it breathes new life into the process with a view to overcoming the existing gaps and shortcomings .
I am pleased , in this regard , that the objectives set out here are founded on the principles of parity and equality , which are at the heart of the proposed Union for the Mediterranean .
The regional projects to be carried out will also make the Euromed partnership more visible and , above all , bring it closer to the citizens .
It is in fact ownership by the people that will guarantee a strong partnership and greater regional cooperation in the Southern Mediterranean .
In pursuing this objective , the official role to be played by the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will therefore be crucial .
This Assembly will finally be recognised as a form of parliamentary support to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership .
Finally , I would like to mention the governance of the project .
Our objective must continue to be to strengthen the political relationships , share out the responsibilities , promote equality and increase the number of meetings between the Euro-Mediterranean partners .
We must not dilute the political content of this project under the weight of an institutional mechanism that would certainly lead to inertia .
We should also ensure that the project is truly efficient by setting up a North-South co-presidency , which would guarantee equality and shared responsibility , and a secretariat , which should be responsible for the governance of the Union for the Mediterranean and for monitoring the implementation of the specific projects .
The Union for the Mediterranean is a major step forward and , as you said , Commissioner , it will launch - I hope - a new era with our partners , for we share a common destiny .
( ES ) Madam President , since there is life outside the European Parliament I imagine that some of us have the opportunity now and again to go to the cinema at the weekend .
I did so on Sunday past and I saw a film that I highly recommend , and I do not have any financial interests in its production or distribution : it is called The Yacoubian Building and it looks at the political , economic , social and cultural problems experienced by a large Mediterranean country , Egypt .
At no point in that film , which is almost two and a half hours long , is there any mention of the European Union , of our presence , of the Barcelona Process .
Does that mean that the Barcelona Process does not exist , that it has not been successful ?
No , we must not confuse things .
It has not been visible enough , but it has contained elements that have benefited the people and that have today become a point of reference for a different type of external policy based on cooperation and based on equality .
The Barcelona Process is the exact opposite of the historical relationship between Europe and the Southern Mediterranean .
It is not a neo-colonial process , it is not a process of demands ; it is a process of partnership , a process of association , and we must not forget that .
This process has not been able to change the major dynamics of the Mediterranean , but how could we expect to change in just over 10 years dynamics that have existed for hundreds of years ?
Nonetheless , it has succeeded in giving a new direction to some of these dynamics .
We therefore need to strengthen it on a political and institutional level , through programmes , through funding .
That is the Union for the Mediterranean .
The European Commission states this clearly in its communication and this Parliament is thus going to support the communication today and support what the vast majority of European governments want : more Barcelona Process , more Barcelona Process , more Barcelona Process .
That is the Union for the Mediterranean : not more structures but the possibility of the people living a better life thanks to cooperation between equals .
I want to say that in that case the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly must be the legislative body that lends democratic legitimacy to this process .
It is no coincidence that you , Mrs Rothe , a member of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , are chairing this sitting today .
Madam President , I thank all colleagues who have spoken and who have supported the Barcelona Process over many years .
It is a wonderful concept and one that deserves to succeed .
I particularly welcome President Pöttering 's initiative in forming some structure inside this Parliament to push forward the Barcelona Process , and President Sarkozy 's commitment to strengthening the process as well with different aspects .
This Monday , 9 June , marks the opening of the European Union Mediterranean University .
Colleagues , I want you to note that date .
We say that our success rests on dialogue , and the European Mediterranean Process should be exemplified by a successful university .
I congratulate the Slovenian Presidency for offering the seat of the University , but I ask colleagues in all committees - and the Commission and the Council of Presidents - why has no budget been set aside for the University ?
Surely we should not rely on one single presidential State - in this case , Slovenia - in furthering the future of the University .
If we want the University to succeed , we have to find a budget for the years ahead .
( ES ) Madam President , the Mediterranean 's history is much more profound than its geography .
You do not need to come from that region to understand , as the Commissioner rightly pointed out , the major problems it faces : migration , mafias trafficking human beings , which unfortunately is not mentioned in the motion for a resolution , drugs , the economic gap between the two sides of the Mediterranean and , of course , radical Islamic fundamentalism , which is one of the greatest black holes in international politics .
Hence the importance of the situation in the Mediterranean for the stability and security of our own political project .
We therefore welcome this Commission communication : we welcome its diligence , as it has rapidly fulfilled a European Council mandate ; we welcome its realism , as it puts things into perspective ; and we welcome its common sense , as it underlines additionality and the multilateral nature of the initiatives taking shape in this new initiative , aimed precisely at breathing new life into the Barcelona Process .
I want to point out , Madam President , that I do not agree with some of the criticisms that have been made during this debate .
I believe that , when necessary , the European Union and the Commission give priority to the ideals over the figures and it is clear that in its external action the European Union always tries to defend the principles in which we believe .
However , it is also true , Madam President , that we frequently have to move from the Beatitudes and grand principles to the accounting books in order to ensure credibility and realism , and move from words to actions in the policies we wish to promote .
Therefore , Madam President , it is very easy to criticise and propose initiatives , but those initiatives have to be assessed in relation to the financial resources that the Member States give the European Union to implement the policies appropriately .
I thus believe , Madam President , that within the framework of the current financial perspective , we have what we have , and if we do not use those resources we will be unable to realise the ambitions that we are striving for as a European Union .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the launch of what was at the time the Mediterranean Union gave rise to controversy and concerns both in Europe and among our Mediterranean partners .
This initiative clearly could not be a purely Franco-French or Euro-European initiative , nor the expression of a security-oriented vision of Euro-Mediterranean relations .
I therefore welcome the Commissioner 's words this morning and the specific proposals put forward , which respond to some of our concerns .
This common project must consist of collective dialogue , based on parity and co-management .
However , the Euro-Mediterranean relationship is an asymmetric relationship that is both emotive and irrational .
It is obviously asymmetric when it comes to trade : both North-South trade and South-South trade .
We therefore need to look at whether or not a free trade zone should be set up in 2010 .
It is irrational because it is based on relations linked to a history that is often painful and complicated , and that is today magnified by what certain conservatives want , namely the clash of civilisations , a confrontation between the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc .
Consequently , if had to take decisions , the first would be to look at this Euro-Mediterranean relationship dispassionately and rationally .

We must be rational in terms of strengthening the role of the parliaments , notably the role of the EMPA ; we must be rational in terms of our proposals on good governance ; we must be rational in terms of the aid that can be provided from a South-South perspective ; we must be rational , too , when it comes to the free movement of people and the Israel-Palestine issue .
We also need to be dispassionate because if we cannot we will not create this area of peace and we will not prevent this clash of civilisations that some people desire .
Madam President , the new impetus given to the Barcelona Process Mediterranean Union has been well presented by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and previous speakers .
The ideas of Barcelona are now even more pertinent than ever .
The prosperity gap between the European Union and most Mediterranean countries has unfortunately increased .
Gradual free trade with the European Union has not attracted the domestic and foreign investment needed to boost the standard of living of our Mediterranean partners .
A lot will depend now on the success of the new projects proposed , which must be visible and tangible to ordinary citizens on both sides of the Mediterranean , and affect and attract the interest of the private sector : projects dealing with topics such as civil protection , the effects of climate change , drought and the lack of water , forest fires , the de-pollution of the Mediterranean Sea , and the development of technology to make the best use of solar energy for the benefit of both sides of the Mediterranean .
Common projects for all Mediterranean countries , north and south , are one of the keys to success .
The issues of migration , social integration , justice and security are also of mutual benefit and visibility .
Let us not forget that our partners are now transit countries for the waves of migration from sub-Saharan Africa .
The question of funds , particularly with a more ambitious project such as this one , remains open .
The more tangible and visible the benefits of this project , the more willing the Member States will be to provide funds .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to congratulate President Sarkozy for once , albeit reluctantly , at this juncture .
With the rumpus that he has created over EU-Mediterranean relations , he has actually managed to give the Barcelona Process , which has existed since 1995 , the higher profile and visibility that it deserves , and has unleashed a new debate about our neighbouring region to the South .
Looking at the outcomes , however , it is clear that Mr Sarkozy 's original idea , launched in February 2007 , has failed on three counts .
Firstly , a possible alternative to EU accession for Turkey was effectively banished by Spain and Italy with the declaration adopted in Rome in December 2007 .
Then Chancellor Merkel ensured that EU-Mediterranean relations would be developed further within the existing EU structures .
Finally , the Commission has now applied the brakes to Mr Sarkozy 's ambitious plans for the secretariat and leadership structure of the project .
It is apparent , in other words , that go-it-alone approaches by Mr Sarkozy will not be tolerated in the European Union .

( MT ) We needed this new beginning ; we needed this new energy for the Mediterranean policy that is so important for the Mediterranean as well as for Europe .
Perhaps the biggest flaw in the Barcelona Process was that our neighbouring countries in the central Mediterranean always felt that this was a European process that was imposed on them and there was not enough of a sense of equality and a sense of membership .
At the summit on 13 July we need to ensure that we are building this new Union for the Mediterranean project on the basis of true membership and true equality .
We should build it on structures that are separate and not impose our prospects on others .
This naturally means that there are obligations as well as rights on both sides , not just on one side .
We welcome this proposal with a mixture of scepticism and at the same time hope .
I hope that hope will triumph over scepticism .
( PT ) The Barcelona Process exists only because a series of central European policy issues are affected by our relationship with the South .
Energy , the fight against terrorism , demography and immigration , economic development and the fight against crime are some of these issues .
However , we must recognise that the Barcelona Process has not in itself been a success .
Europe 's big success has in fact been to promote reforms in candidate countries .
However , the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean cannot join the European Union but are , in some cases , our most problematic neighbours .
Therefore , the question is how we must change our strategy to relaunch the process so that the new Union for the Mediterranean is not just another fine idea .
Do we believe that the way forward is support for specific investments within the framework of truly open markets ?
Do we believe in the broadest possible access to Community recovery instruments ?
Do we defend the idea of the amount of aid depending on the quality of the reforms to be undertaken ?
I believe so , because the Mediterranean 's problems are also our problems .
We must bear in mind that , if we fail to understand what has gone wrong in Barcelona , we will be unable to introduce a new dynamic into the relationship with our southern partners .
( FR ) Mr President , I would like to ask the Commissioner , Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , not to look on this Barcelona Process as a mere economic process .
When Europe needs energy , it turns to Africa to benefit from its sun and sand .
Is that not a little too little ?
Should we not be implementing this process through work in the field of culture ?
We will be dealing with countries that are very diverse , proud countries , countries that have a history and a great culture .
Should we not be making efforts to improve social cohesion through in-depth cultural work ?
Not a single document refers to the Anna Lindt Foundation , which for some years now has been striving to promote cooperation .
I would also be very keen to see further progress , too , on the proposed Euro-Arab university .
( BG ) Mr. President , Mme Commissioner , The issue related to the establishment of a Black Sea Union is of strategic significance .
This is a process for joint future development concerning not only the increased influence of the European Union and economic cooperation , but also goodneighbourliness .
The Mediterranean region with its rich cultural and historical layers and modern political and economic influence is particularly important .
I view this as a process , a step towards a more global role of the EU as a whole rather than of any single country .
At the same time , the Mediterranean axis in the development of the EU policies should be linked to the Eastern dimension of the EU strategic projects .
The Black Sea areas has always been linked to the Mediterranean and thus both should be comparable and put on equal footing today .
This is the only way for us to achieve new efficiency , greater influence of the European Union 's policies and values .
It will lead to new added value of the EU policies .
Mr President , I would say to the Commissioner that planning to build motorways will not solve the serious problems facing the Mediterranean area , unless she is intent on convincing President Sarkozy to build a six-lane motorway linking France with Turkey !
Commissioner , I was disappointed with your introductory speech , because you did not address some of the major political problems in the Mediterranean .
I refer , for example , to the occupation by Israel of land belonging to the Palestinians ; to the occupation of Cyprus by Turkey ; and to the continuing colonisation , in this the 21st century , of part of Morocco by Spain , which has two colonies in Morocco , and to Britain 's two colonies in Cyprus and - I understand - one colony in Spain .
Unless you address those serious issues , we will not be able to turn the theoretical plans for a Mediterranean Union into a reality .
( PL ) Mr President , Europe really does breathe through two lungs .
One of these lungs is the Mediterranean dimension we are currently debating .
The other is the Eastern dimension , which includes countries sharing some of their borders with Poland .
By way of example I could name Ukraine , Belarus and Russia .
The Eastern dimension also includes countries in the Caucasus , such as Georgia and Armenia .
It is right and proper that today , 13 years after Barcelona , we should be devoting so much time to the vital Mediterranean dimension of our European policy .
It should be emphasised , however , that this is only part of a greater whole .
The policy on the countries of the Mediterranean Basin is necessary and needs to be renewed , but it is only one element of the European Union 's broader foreign policy .
Our policy towards future members of the European Union should be a very important part of the latter .
To put it plainly , I do not believe that any of the Mediterranean countries we are today discussing will join the Union .
Ukraine , Georgia and Armenia are , however , bound to become Members .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , as far as I am concerned , it takes two to tango .
What I want to know is whether there is really enough interest on the other side of the Mediterranean .
When we see today the dance the French Government is having to perform to actually bring the Mediterranean heads of state together , to get them to come to Paris on 13 July , I wonder if there is really the same commitment on the other side .
I want to tell you that your revisited project is extremely interesting .
The European Union was built after the war on the basis of coal and steel .
If we are proposing to our partners that we build a project for the 21st century , based on climate change , on renewable energy , on the restoration of a Mediterranean environment that has been completely ruined , then yes , we can support this project .
However , where is the consistency , Commissioner ?
What can we say to this solo by Mr Sarkozy , who even today , before his presidency , is urging Algeria to sign an agreement on the establishment of a nuclear plant ?
I think that that is a clear example of the contradiction that perhaps exists between the Council and the Commission .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Matsakis is quite right : I agree with much of what he said .
There have always been difficulties and problems for the states bordering the mare nostrum , as it was called 2000 years ago .
However , what Mr Watson , Chairman of the Liberal Group , said is also true in my opinion : we must learn to give as well as take .
I would therefore call upon Italy 's new government under Prime Minister Berlusconi to heed the pleas and entreaties of Colonel Gaddafi , whom we were very eager to please at the time of the Bulgarian nurses affair , ignoring everything that lay behind it .
He has repeatedly requested Italy to build a motorway in his country .
A motorway will benefit not just President Gaddafi but all the inhabitants of North Africa , so we will be showing our good will and doing something positive for the Mediterranean as a whole .
( PL ) Mr President , the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East are strategically important regions from the European Union 's point of view .
It is abundantly clear that an area of peace and economic stability based on the principles of democracy , solidarity and cooperation must be created if we are to rise to common challenges .
It is also necessary to revive and develop the Barcelona Process , so as to establish a strong partnership in the area of foreign and security policy with a view to combating terrorism .
The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership cannot focus exclusively on issues pertaining to the economy and trade , however .
It should be accompanied by strengthened regional cooperation , closer social integration and by cooperation in the area of protection of the natural environment .
In addition , we should emphasise the need to strengthen policies aimed at increasing the role of women in Mediterranean societies , by promoting gender equality .
Respect for customs and traditions must not infringe the fundamental rights of women .
In conclusion , I should like to welcome the Commission 's proposal on the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly .
The role and democratic legitimacy of the latter should be reinforced .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will continue in French .
Perhaps Mr Schulz does not agree , but I believe that President Sarkozy provided the impulse for the Union for the Mediterranean .
That is why I think that for once I am nevertheless going to continue to speak in that language .
First of all , I see , ladies and gentlemen , that this debate or this matter has provoked strong reactions .
Everyone has something to say on the issue and that is extremely important .
It is true , as far as I am concerned , that peace could perhaps hang in the balance in the Mediterranean .
It is also true that there is still a gap between the two shores : it is shrinking but it is still there .
We must take account of the progress that has been made : macro-economic stability , lower inflation , greatly improved human rights .
Naturally , there is still a great deal to be done .
On the one hand , reforms are badly needed and these reforms must be more rapid and more comprehensive .
In addition , the issue of trade and investment is vital .
I do not agree with Mr Wurtz that the Barcelona Process is dead .
No , as I have always said , it has been very difficult to implement it because of the existing political problems , and that is true .
When there was discussion of the political problems , as we know , it was about the Barcelona Process .
Unfortunately , these problems will remain even if we try to overcome these issues with very specific projects , which is something I support .
I therefore believe that this idea is a good idea and I think that we have renewed it through a pragmatic and concrete approach that is , of course , fully inclusive .
As regards free trade and the free trade agreements , ladies and gentlemen , I must point out that as a result of the excessively long transition periods , 2010 is the first year in which we will be able to implement these agreements .
In fact , we still do not have any free trade agreements .
As far as agriculture is concerned , we are in the middle of negotiations but it is very complicated , for the other side too , because it involved not just giving , but also receiving .
These negotiations are always difficult .
Free trade agreements with Tunisia and Israel will enter into force in 2010 .
A similar agreement with Morocco is being finalised , but considerable efforts are still needed .
The last country concerned will be Egypt .
You can thus see that things are moving very slowly , and that is not because of the process ; it is because of the countries themselves , which do not wish to move any faster .
That is important to point out .
In spite of everything , this new idea is a good idea , an opportunity , and I hope that the partners are going to make use of it .
It is true , too , Mrs Isler-Béguin , that the partners clearly have to want to dance .
That is why the Commission spoke with each of them to ensure that its proposals reflected their concerns and their point of view .
When it comes to human rights , ladies and gentlemen , I must point out that I myself would not have done anything if there had been no human rights .
However , the Barcelona Process remains ; that is the idea .
The institutions are also involved .
In principle , the institutions play a role , and that applies to the Anna Lindt Foundation , too .
Of course , the Anna Lindt Foundation is present , and with a new presidency and a new director these aspects should be further enhanced .
These things are not lost .
The Neighbourhood Policy that I mentioned , which is a bilateral policy , also remains of course , because through its action plans it is genuinely trying to strengthen and promote the reforms .
Do not think , therefore , that it is not involved .
That is the real value added of the projects that we have actually implemented and emphasised .
As regards the Euro-Mediterranean University in Portorož , I think first of all that it is an excellent idea by the Slovenian Presidency .
I am personally going to attend its inauguration ; I have been invited to it and I fully intend to be there .
As regards funding , first and foremost , since it is a Slovenian idea , it is only natural that Slovenia must also make a contribution to it , which it will do to the tune of EUR 1 million .
I have also been asked for a contribution , which is why I have tried to find something among funds that , in principle , are already allocated .
That is far from easy .
I have found EUR 1 million , which I am going to add to this project .
However , there are other instruments and I have informed the presidency of them .
Firstly , there are the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund , which simply need to be re-distributed in Slovenia , and secondly , there are the funds for research and education .
Thus there are funds available .
In addition , you are of course all aware of the Erasmus grants , which are still applicable .
That is something new that we are going to strengthen .
I would like to talk briefly about culture , Madam .
I think that someone mentioned that Robert Schuman once said that if we were to start building the European Union again , we should start with culture .
That is true , but while there is so much poverty , so much illiteracy , etc . , we have to do other things , too , and I can repeat what I said in relation to human rights : all the culture programmes remain in place and there is quite a number of them .
Finally , I will say a brief word on the secretariat because that was a very precise question .
In the light of the different views expressed , we concluded that , as indicated in our communication , the secretariat should be asked to perform the role of making proposals for joint initiatives , which would then be adopted by political bodies , and ensuring the necessary follow-up of project-related decisions taken by the heads of state or government .
The secretariat could also have a separate legal personality with an autonomous status .
The detailed modalities have yet to be clarified .
I will conclude with a few words on the nuclear issue .
Madam , the Memorandum of Understanding that our President signed with the IAEA , the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna , relates to safety and security .
I personally support it and I think that everyone should because we cannot choose what energy sources the countries use .
Each country has the right , as you said , to have some reservations about nuclear energy , and you know that we ourselves do .
However , the countries must at least have the opportunity to do as they wish .
As such , safety and security are crucial , and those are the issues dealt with by the Memorandum .
I apologise , Mr President , but as I said at the beginning , this debate has provoked strong reactions .
To conclude this debate I have received six motions for a resolution1 tabled in accordance with Rule 103 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - It is a pleasure to hear statements from the Council and the Commission regarding the Barcelona Process and the proposal for a Union for the Mediterranean .
The latter is to be initiated on 13 July in Paris during the French Presidency .
The Government of Malta has issued a position paper on the said statements .
I fully agree with the proposals being made regarding the Union for the Mediterranean .
As it is important not to duplicate efforts and energies , the suggestion relating to maritime activities is laudable .
Malta has offered to host a secretariat to overview the implementation of such proposals and I fully endorse this offer , not only because of the unique geographical position of the island in the Mediterranean but also because we have the infrastructure , personnel and experience to host such an institute .
To conclude , I would like to mention that , just over thirty years ago , it was a Labour Government that managed to bring world attention to the importance of the Mediterranean and the necessity of collaboration between the countries bordering the Northern and Southern shores of this sea .
in writing . - ( IT ) I welcome the establishment of the Union for the Mediterranean , which will help to improve and intensify relations with our Mediterranean partners and will promote mutual awareness , growth , employment and training in the EU and the 12 non-European countries concerned .
Promoting peace and democracy , immigration controls , economic relations and raw materials supplies : these have historically been the key points of my country 's neighbourhood policy with the Mediterranean countries .
Bettino Craxi was a pioneer in this regard .
The Union for the Mediterranean will help to facilitate the completion of cross-border projects that are important for the entire area , serving to improve the motorways of the seas , combat marine pollution , improve civil protection , create a better-integrated energy market and develop new renewable technologies .
The Union for the Mediterranean must contribute to promoting democracy and resolving the conflicts that are still destabilising the Middle East and the Western Sahara , with assistance from the Euromed Parliamentary Assembly , which must be fully involved .
Hygiene of foodstuffs ( debate )
The next item is the report by Horst Schnellhardt , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation No 11 concerning the abolition of discrimination in transport rates and conditions , in implementation of Article 79 ( 3 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and Regulation ( EC ) No 852 / 2004 of the European Parliament and the Council on the hygiene of foodstuffs - C6-0211 / 2007 - .


Vice-President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are talking about a project which serves as a pilot for one of the largest and most important policy programmes initiated by this Commission , namely freeing small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe from unnecessary administrative burdens .
In other words , it is about cutting red tape . We are not talking about problems of veterinary law today ; let me just make that clear .
If we were , I would not be here .
This is about reducing administrative burdens in a way which will strengthen the European economy and thus make a contribution to creating jobs .
The Commission is fully aware that cutting administrative costs must never result in less safety for our citizens , so this is not about lowering standards .
It is about enforcing standards in such a way that unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles are removed for our companies .
We will be very strict on enforcing this fundamental principle in this case as well .
Let me emphasise that the Commission has not the slightest intention of changing the substance of the rules on the hygiene of foodstuffs .
The identification of hazards and the designation of procedural steps in the production process so that hazards can be eliminated remain our central concern .
We are not lowering existing standards of food hygiene in any way ; instead , we want to establish more clarity .
We would like to ensure that the existing flexible provisions on record-keeping can be applied more effectively .
This will not entail greater complexity for the relevant authorities in the Member States , for already the responsibility for compliance with the regulations lies with the food producers , not with the authorities .
We want to establish a rule for micro-enterprises which exempts them from certain requirements of the existing Regulation .
We are talking about the very small family firms : bakeries , small food stores , market stalls , cafes and bars , shops at petrol stations and mini-markets .
Why , you might well ask , do we require these small family firms , none which has anything to do with the internal market , to undergo the same bureaucratic procedures as the major supermarket chains ?
That is a good question , and it is the question that we are here to discuss .
Let me emphasise that the rules apply to all food producers and companies involved in the production , processing and sale of foods , irrespective of size .
The rules do not apply to foods designed for private household consumption , and they do not apply to the producers of small quantities of unprocessed products for local retailers , such as farming , hunting and fishing .
The current flexible rules on record-keeping make no distinction between the various sizes of companies .
For the purposes of clarity , let me explain : the small corner shop where you can buy your food here in Brussels at 10 o 'clock at night must comply with precisely the same regulations as the giant supermarket chains .
My question is this : can that possibly be fair ?
Due to the nature of their business operations , it goes without saying that these very complex and comprehensive provisions are easy for major companies to cope with , but that is not the case for micro-enterprises .
For the formal application of the HACCP system , food producers must undertake a hazard analysis .
This can be a complex and burdensome task requiring expert input .
In order to reduce the burdens associated with this type of analysis , the Regulation already allows small food producers to make use of good practice guidelines which have been drawn up for the relevant sector .
They already exist for bakeries , breweries , butchers ' shops and restaurants in various Member States , but they do not exist everywhere .
One objective of the Commission proposal is to ensure that the rules on possible exemptions , which are already established in principle in the Regulation and the accompanying guidelines , are being used efficiently . What does this mean in practice ?
Well this brings us to the heart of the matter . If , during the first stage of the HACCP process , a food business operator can prove that either there are no hazards that must be prevented , eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels , or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled through the implementation of general and specific food hygiene requirements , then the operator should be exempt from all the other requirements of the HACCP Directive .
Let me put it in straightforward terms : this flexibility is already available under the current Directive , but it is not being applied by all the Member States .
The Commission 's proposal is therefore presented as a fast track action within the framework of our Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens in the European Union .
The proposal has met with some resistance in the Council and in some Member States . I am aware of that .
These Member States do not appear to attach as much importance to reducing administrative burdens and cutting the costs of red tape - especially for their SMEs - as the Commission and the European Parliament do .
The impression which we have gained , however , is that this debate has so far been conducted only between civil servants in the Member States ; it would seem that their politicians have not yet addressed the issue .
In my view , the politicians in the Member States whose civil servants have shown such resistance to the proposal cannot possibly justify to the public why their country is resisting a Commission proposal which could make life easier for hundreds of thousands of their micro-enterprises and small businesses .
At that moment , the frequent agitation against Brussels - this ' bureaucratic monster ' which is supposedly determined to regulate and restrict every aspect of people 's lives - would be revealed as mere propaganda and would collapse , and it would become apparent who is actually responsible for the excessive red tape .
From the Commission 's perspective , this opposition is regrettable , as this proposal constitutes an important , substantive and symbolic element of our Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens in the European Union .
I am very grateful to Mr Schnellhardt for his report and his active support .
I would urge you all to give it your backing , for I am convinced that a clear political message from Parliament of the kind that could be sent out today will create the necessary political momentum in the Council , too , to get this proposal through .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , with this report , we are making a contribution to cutting red tape .
We have succeeded in making it clear that it is , and should be , possible to ease the burden associated with the implementation of HACCP criteria , especially for small businesses , without lowering or jeopardising our high hygiene standards .
A priority - as the Commissioner has already said - is to ease the burden associated with record-keeping .
I would just like to remind you that these options were already available in the hygiene package which came into force in 2006 .
However , we have noted that following this paradigm shift in the area of hygiene , difficulties have arisen in the context of implementation .
It has always been the stated aim of Parliament and the Commission to preserve diversity of food production in a European Union of 27 Member States .
It is only right and proper that small butchers ' shops , for example , should be able to continue to operate in future too .
However , the information that we have received from various countries is that in some regions , some small companies are finding economic survival increasingly difficult .
That is why it is essential to draw attention to the flexibility built into the regulations and help it to become a reality .
This - nothing else - is what we have emphasised clearly and unequivocally in this report .
Maintaining flexibility means that we mention the focus on small and medium-sized enterprises only in the recitals .
This makes it possible , for example , for companies which have 11 , not 10 , employees , let us say , to benefit from favourable treatment so that they too can apply for the administrative burden to be eased : provided , of course , that they can prove that either there are no hazards or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled .
The report also emphasises that the food business operator is responsible for furnishing the proof that either there are no hazards that must be prevented , eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels , or that identified hazards are sufficiently and regularly controlled through the implementation of general and specific food hygiene requirements .
In 2006 we adopted a hygiene package which applies as it stands in the EU27 .
That is why I fail to understand the amendment tabled by Mrs Corbey , which states that it should be a matter for the Member States whether to allow any easing of burdens in HACCP implementation .
This would create new subsidiarity scenarios , which was actually what we were trying to avoid with the Regulation ; in other words , we do not want any distortions of competition .
The adoption of Mrs Corbey 's amendment would also conflict with the intentions of the Regulation itself : in other words , the regulation would conflict with itself .
That is certainly not what we are trying to achieve !
The text adopted in committee is certainly acceptable , but it explicitly restricts the option of easing the burdens to small and medium-sized enterprises .
The strong involvement of the authorities , too , is out of step with the principles of the Regulation .
In the Regulations themselves , it is made very clear that food businesses have a responsibility to maintain good hygiene practice and must furnish proof that they are controlling any risks .
There have been repeated objections to the effect that a review of the regulations is due in 2009 so no new measures are needed now .
I take issue with this view .
By 2009 all food-producing companies must be licensed .
Problems are likely to arise in this licensing process .
This will trigger a debate and is likely to put at risk the survival of the small butchers I have already mentioned , for example .
In fact , that was the starting point underlying the Commission 's intention to bring forward this proposal .
It is very important , therefore , for the European Parliament to send out a clear signal about the intention established in the relevant Regulation .
This signal is sent out , first and foremost , to food companies and the regulatory authorities .
The European Parliament has a strong track record in cutting red tape , and should do so again now , by giving its seal of approval to these regulatory provisions .
Mr President , I dare say I shall not use up my two minutes .
I merely wish to point out that the Committee on Legal Affairs , on examining the legal principles , considered Article 95 to be the legal basis for the first part , and Articles 95 and 175 for the second part .
The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs will be taken into account when validating the decision .
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( HU ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
For European citizens of the 21st century , health and the consumption of good-quality foodstuffs are of overriding importance .
Our task as MEPs is to guarantee this , but to do this we need legislation and procedures such as HACCP to guarantee the interests of consumers .
However , it is just as important that we do not go overboard and over-regulate our lives , because in doing so we would not serve quality of life but bureaucracy .
In my view , the present compromise recommendation points in a good direction .
Experience up to now has shown that the HACCP provisions currently in force are unjustifiably too stringent in many cases .
Moreover , they cannot always be applied in the hospitality and hotels sector , since they assume the conditions and working methods of the food industry .
Despite this , the new Member States , including Hungary , have implemented the HACCP provisions to the full , and even beyond .
Our companies have suffered from this , many have abandoned their traditions and practices that are hundreds of years old , but this cannot be our goal , so we need to make changes .
Firstly , it is important to emphasise that restaurants are not food factories , so they must not be required to follow the same provisions , since this erodes quality and traditions .
Let us not forget that there were Michelin stars before the HACCP .
We must reduce the exaggerated number of administrative duties .
I support the fact that exemption from the HACCP should only apply to micro-businesses and SMEs that are able to monitor food hygiene .
I regret the fact that , while micro-businesses are taxable , the exemption of SMEs is hidden in the text .
It is important to state and declare this clearly .
Finally , the system must be more flexible than it is now .
The competent national authority should decide what common sense dictates in a given case .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , better regulations , who does not want that ?
Our Group greatly appreciates the efforts of Commissioner Verheugen to cut down on excessive bureaucracy .
Anything that we can do to help small and medium-sized enterprises , we must do .
I have set to work on his proposals on food hygiene and I have been making enquiries in the Netherlands .
My colleagues have been doing the same in their own countries .
How are the bakers , butchers and corner shops doing all over Europe ?
We have already heard from Sweden about the problem of pieces of cake being served in the back of the church .
Complaints have come from the Netherlands about the rules that theatres and cinemas have to follow .
In both of these countries , however , it turned out that the hygiene laws were not the cause of the problem .
Other messages have come in too though : from small shops in the United Kingdom which have made great efforts over the last two years to apply the HACCP principles and were proud to have managed it all .
Should Parliament now go and say that it is all unnecessary ?
That brings us to my next point .
In our last term of office , we worked hard on the reform of the general food law .
We had to do this because of the shortcomings in food safety and a number of major food scandals .
The essence of the general food law is that the responsibility for food safety rests with the producer .
The public authorities have a supervisory role .
We cut across this division of roles if companies are given exemptions based on a risk analysis , as this would mean that the government was taking the responsibility upon itself again and that would in fact be a step backwards .
It is also an unnecessary step , as it has also become clear meanwhile that the implementation is actually going very well in the majority of Member States .
The small businesses in the European Member States have already put their houses in order and they are working with practical workable hygiene codes .
There are two things that we should not forget .
First , the general food law that we hope to amend today replaced a whole raft of rules .
Even in 2004 , Parliament , and certainly the PSE Group , made the case for combating excessive bureaucracy .
Small companies can already appeal for flexibility under the present rules .
A second point is that a reform is already planned for 2009 .
If there are serious problems , they can be resolved in 2009 , i.e. next year .
In a word , our Group is not convinced of the need to implement changes in a great hurry now , without a thorough evaluation .
All the same , we do not want to let the small companies down , which is why we have tabled an amendment that entails leaving the decision to the Member States .
Should there be urgent problems in one of the Member States , then that state can decide for itself whether to permit exemptions .
That is perfectly in accordance with the Regulation , Mr Schnellhardt , and what is more , it is very pragmatic and also very simple .
I am therefore asking you to support Amendment 12 .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I also wish to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur for the hard work he has put into this report .
This proposal aims at reducing the administrative burdens in food-related enterprises .
Specifically , the express goal is to exempt micro-enterprises from basic HACCP procedural obligations but without , of course , in any way compromising food hygiene and consumer health safety .
This was deemed necessary as companies with less than 10 employees , whose activities consist predominantly of the sale of food directly to the final consumer , are suffering severely under the heavy bureaucratic necessities of HACCP to the extent that , in many cases , bankruptcy becomes an inevitability .
Such an aim is fully in line with our expressed wish to support small businesses in their antagonistic and - in most instances - unfair fight for survival against the large companies .
This aim appeared at some stages of our deliberations not to be shared by either the rapporteur or the Council .
It became my understanding that their preferred line was - and , it seems , probably still is - to provide exemptions and flexibility equally for all companies , large and small .
At first sight and in theory , this may appear proper , but in practice it is grossly unfair to small companies and clearly defeats the purpose of having this piece of legislation in the first place , which is of course to help the micro-enterprises .
Some may argue that this is preferential treatment and unfair competition .
They may be right on strictly legalistic and oversimplified theoretical grounds but , in terms of fairness and long-term planning , it is the same as putting a 6-foot champion and a 3-foot child in a boxing ring on exactly equal terms .
Our philosophy is that , in some circumstances , the small and weak need some privileged assistance .
Otherwise our free internal market will become a deadly pond where the big fish will eat the little ones and then probably eat each other .
Our voting philosophy reflects this .
I urge you to vote to protect the small businesses of Europe .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , the report by Mr Schnellhardt contains a number of important amendments to the Commission 's proposal .
Some of these deal with the differences between Regulation No 852 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning food hygiene , and Regulation No 11 .
The proposal is for greater flexibility on the part of the relevant bodies where food hygiene is concerned , and for procedures to be simplified .
Both these issues are particularly important for small enterprises operating on local and regional markets .
Implementation of the Regulation will require cooperation between supervisory bodies at different levels of the market , constant monitoring of the latter and appropriate support from the Commission , concerning the exchange of best practice for example .
Pursuant to adoption of the rapporteur 's amendments , this Regulation will have a beneficial effect on the market , and we therefore support it .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Europeans are entitled to safe food .
That should , I believe , always be the main message in debates like this and the main underlying assumption for European policy .
Of course , it is also important to ensure that the citizens are obstructed by as few pointless bureaucratic rules as possible , but the present rules already allow scope for micro-enterprises to be exempted from the most complicated administrative hygiene requirements .
Coffee in community centres or stalls selling soft drinks are not under threat and other businesses should simply make sure that their hygiene is good .
It is not necessary , therefore , to allow new exemptions apart from the small micro-enterprises , and it is not sensible at all to expand the number of exceptional cases or to make the rules more vague , as the rapporteur seems to want to do on certain points .
Just like the consumer organisations , I would advise strongly against this .

( SK ) I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Schnellhardt , for his report , dealing with two different themes that are subject to different procedures .
Since the hygiene of foodstuffs is subject to the codecision procedure , this procedure will inevitably hold back the area of prices and transport conditions , subject only to a consultation process .
I agree with the stipulation that food safety requirements in individual Member States must be the same across the board , or at least should not significantly differ from each other .
However , here we come to the question of imports to the European Union from third countries where the foodstuffs are full of pesticides .
We have a polluted environment , which has a negative impact on human health .
Consequently , we must do everything possible to prevent unhealthy foodstuffs from damaging our health .
We have to start testing foodstuffs , their components and the raw materials of animal and plant origin for health hazards , hygienic acceptability and biological values .
We have to concentrate on identification or on possible falsification .
We have to test for foreign materials in food and to focus on everyday use : for example not just phthalates in toys , which are not used by everyone on a daily basis .
Slovak producers are often criticised with regard to the hygiene of foodstuffs .
I must point out , however , that Slovakia has much stricter food standards than the 15 old Member States .

- ( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to thank our rapporteur for his excellent cooperation : at first sight it seems to be a straightforward matter , but when we listen to our fellow Members , we can hear that it certainly is not .
It should be obvious to everyone that every business must indeed aim to give the best possible hygiene guarantees , but the way they achieve this aim need not , of course , be the same for all businesses .
I think it is crucial that the competent authorities in the different Member States do actually make use of the flexibility that is already provided for in the present Regulation , and exempt certain food companies from what is after all a very complicated HACCP procedure , on condition , of course , that the same standards of hygiene safety can be demonstrated and guaranteed .
I believe that it is perfectly possible to do this by observing good hygiene practices based on sectoral guides , such as those that have already been drawn up in some countries .
Nevertheless , I would still like to ask the Commissioner - if he could listen to me for a moment , as I see that he is talking to our rapporteur - whether he can give further clarification on a couple of points .
He has said that all food companies are covered by this , regardless of their size .
I would still like to hear him say whether he really believes that this report offers more flexibility to a broader range of food companies and not just micro-enterprises .
Secondly , the Commissioner has just said that no additional burden will be imposed on the Member States but there may be additional burdens on businesses .
What I would really like to hear , therefore , is whether the proof that the companies have to provide really can be based on the sectoral guides , so that this does not involve additional red tape for companies .
( RO ) The report outlines the necessity of reducing bureaucracy in the two fields .
Regulation No 11 on eliminating discrimination in terms of tariffs and transport conditions requires carriers to hold a transport document which should contain , among others , the distances , routes and borders passage points .
In the field of transportations , the proposal aims at the reduction of certain obligations to provide statistics in the transportations field .
With regard to Regulation ( EC ) No 852 / 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs , I would like to support the amendment submitted by the European Socialist Group , in which the competent bodies are allowed to exempt economic agents in the foods sector from the implementation of one or several of the imposed measures , provided that these bodies are capable of proving that there is no risk that must be avoided , or that all identified risks are sufficiently and regularly controlled by means of application of the general and special requirements of hygiene of foodstuffs .
This refers to bakeries , butcheries , fruit and vegetables shops and , mainly , to market stands .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , food and hygiene go together ; there is absolutely no doubt about that .
Everyone has at some time in their lives eaten something that was ' off ' .
On the other hand , over-caution and excessively stringent regulation do not give us a cornucopia of foods which meet exemplary hygiene standards .
A small producer is more likely to close down his shop because he cannot afford to pay the additional workers required to fill in forms rather than bake bread .
My host , who serves the bread rolls , does not have to keep a record of whether he has wiped the counter and washed the dishes .
After all , if he failed to take these basic precautions , he would have no customers anyway .
What is happening is that responsible legislation is sliding into regulatory zeal that does more harm than good .
That is why I am completely in favour of easing the administrative burden on companies , especially micro-enterprises , which find it more difficult to cope with this burden than the major corporations .
I would like to see this greater awareness of the impacts on micro-enterprises being carried over into other areas of legislation that we discuss in this House as well , especially environmental and consumer protection .
( DE ) Mr President , we have opted for a system in which every enterprise which produces , processes or sells food must continuously and consistently monitor and document every step in its operations .
While we are sitting here debating whether food hygiene is guaranteed , however , consumer confidence is being undermined by BSE and scandals involving rotten meat , adulterated olive oil , and wine containing glycerine .
The fact that more and more GM foods are coming into the EU , even though these are rejected by 70 % of the European population , also does very little to boost people 's confidence .
That is why we must give very careful thought to today 's decision , and we must ensure that the health of our citizens is not sacrificed through our kowtowing to the food corporations in advance of the EU-US Summit .
We cannot demand compliance with more stringent provisions from our own producers while allowing imports of foods which are not produced in accordance with the same rigorous standards , given that this after all offers advantages in terms of price and competitiveness .
At some point , domestic producers will start demanding exemptions as well , and they would be quite justified in doing so .
Mr President , the purpose of this proposal is to reduce administrative burdens on small enterprises .
The proposal came from the Enterprise and Industry DG as part of the Better Regulation initiative .
Unfortunately , while I am very sympathetic to the idea of reducing administrative burdens on small businesses , I find this proposal was initially ill-defined ( Mr Schnellhardt has amended it extremely well ) , as it allowed some businesses , such as mobile food outlets and garage forecourt retailers - two categories of businesses that do need to be considered under hygiene rules - to derogate from applying all the hygiene rules .
There is discretion in the hygiene regulation itself to allow businesses who do not need to apply the full HACCP regime to derogate from it with the approval of competent authorities .
The problem appears to be that administrations in some Member States are not using their discretionary powers , and in some regions of the EU small sweetshops and even church halls are being asked to apply full HACCP rules .
It is my view that it is the application of the original legislation and not the legislation itself that is the problem .

( HU ) I feel that Mr Verheugen 's efforts to help SMEs should be supported fully , and I would also like to thank Mr Schnellhardt .
Food safety is of crucial importance in the European Union , but we should only regulate and monitor it sensibly and rationally .
People often have the feeling that excessive regulation by the EU helps multinational companies and not SMEs .
Mr Verheugen is right that the national monitoring authorities continue to exacerbate the situation , and so small and medium-sized food factories are inspected unnecessarily in Hungary too , and the provisions are complied with excessively and in a pushy way , while they do not dare to take any real action against the multinational companies that have greater lobbying power .
Unfortunately , this report will no longer support the small village abattoirs and bakeries that have been forced to abandon production as a consequence of the incomprehensible over-regulation , but I feel this report should be supported unreservedly .
( PL ) Mr President , I support the Commission 's proposal .
Reducing the bureaucratic burden on small enterprises , small shops and service providers will enable more such entities to survive .
It is therefore in the interest of small entrepreneurs , their workers and consumers .
Accordingly , providing the criteria of the HACCP system are not infringed , and providing hygiene is maintained in the production of food and services in this area , it is worth helping small bakers , confectioners , butchers , greengrocers and corner cafés , all of which tend to be family businesses .
The effect of these legal changes should , however , be subsequently monitored .
I congratulate the rapporteur .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , we are not talking about whether we want more hygiene or less hygiene .
We are talking about easing burdens and cutting red tape for small and medium-sized enterprises .
The question which we need to address once again , then , is this : is HACCP appropriate and necessary in every case and in every company , large or small , and regardless of who is responsible ?
In the case of companies which are engaged predominantly in the direct sale of food to the final consumer - such as bakeries , butchers , food stores and market stalls , and indeed , farmers ' coffee shops , wine bars and the seasonal wine taverns run by the vineyards , where the owner or manager is known to the customer and is generally available in person - we must undoubtedly apply different criteria from those applicable to a major corporation .
This is about the dismantling of bureaucracy and it is about accountability .
I think we should certainly harness the principle of subsidiarity here , but not by demanding the opportunity to introduce significantly different requirements in individual Member States . We must have a level playing field in terms of competition .
I therefore support the Commission 's proposal and Mr Schnellhardt 's report .
( FR ) Mr President , no one is denying that we need to establish a procedure based on the principles of hazard analysis and critical control points .
Everyone welcomes the fact that at Community level the European Union is proposing inventive legislation on foodstuffs to guarantee the highest possible level of food safety for our fellow citizens .
However , we must reduce the amount of pointless bureaucracy , especially for small and micro-enterprises , and ensure efficiency without restricting the objectives relating to foodstuffs .
Do we need to sink into a health and regulatory phobia and drift ?
Certainly not .
As the representative of Bourgogne-Franche Comté in Parliament , I am familiar with the methods used for the production of all the cheeses in my region by small and micro-enterprises .
Bacteria are necessary to make cheese .
Reintroduced to pasteurised milk - for certain cheeses - they ensure that these products meet the highest food safety standards .
Increasing the volume of regulatory procedures would weaken small and micro-enterprises .
That is why I am calling on Parliament to accept Amendment 12 , which facilitates this flexibility .
When it comes to respect for cultural diversity and dialogue , I believe that it is essential ...
( The President cut off the speaker )
Member of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me set the record straight once again .
This is not about changing the current food hygiene rules . These rules will not be amended , even to a very minor extent , and there will be no exemptions of any kind for anyone .
In future , as now , everyone must comply with our food hygiene rules .
What we are talking about today is something entirely different .
We are talking about whether the extremely complicated and bureaucratic provisions that we currently have in place should be applied to all businesses if , in the first stage of the procedure , they are able to prove that there is absolutely no risk , or that the risk is sufficiently controlled .
That is the purpose of this proposal .
In answer to my question : the proposal only concerns those businesses which can demonstrate in the very first stage that there are no risks to food hygiene , or that such risks are sufficiently controlled .
This provision is , of course , one which will have a particular impact on small and medium-sized enterprises and especially the micro-enterprises , which will find it easy to furnish the necessary proof .
The proposal will not result in an additional burden on the authorities , unless Mr Corbett 's additional amendment is adopted , which would mean that at every stage of the procedure , the authorities would have to take action .
In that case , we would have a greater administrative burden .
I would ask you to support the rapporteur 's proposal .
He has indeed improved upon the Commission 's original proposal .
What we are trying to achieve is quite straightforward : the existing law is currently being applied in a way that does not conform with the legislator 's original intention . With this amendment today , we will ensure that the law will be applied as originally intended by the legislator .
The Commission underlines that the amendment to the HACCP regulation does not weaken existing food hygiene requirements .
It simply serves to provide greater clarity and , thereby , more effective use of the existing flexibility provisions of the regulation in respect of reporting requirements .
The existing flexibility provisions in respect of reporting requirements do not distinguish between different size classes of companies .
However , given the nature of operations of larger food business operators , these provisions are less likely to apply to larger companies .
The amendment is , therefore , likely to be particularly beneficial for small and medium sized enterprises .
A proposed new recital makes this explicit .
The amendment does not create any additional compliance burdens for competent authorities since the responsibility to demonstrate compliance rests exclusively with food business operators .
The objective of the amendment is to reduce administrative burdens on companies through a more effective uptake of the existing flexibility provisions on reporting .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very grateful indeed for the various contributions to this debate .
I think almost all the contributions have made one thing clear : we have the will to roll back bureaucracy , and we have the will to ease the burden on small and medium-sized companies in Europe when it comes to implementing the HACCP rules .
Now it is up to us to express this will by voting in favour of the right amendments , and that means Amendment 10 , which we have agreed with the Commission and representatives of the Council presidency .
This amendment states in clear and unequivocal terms what we want to achieve .
In this way , we can proceed in a very straightforward manner , building on the Regulations adopted in 2006 .
We want to equip the authorities and , indeed , the food companies with a procedure which enables them to react quickly .
As I pointed out in my speech earlier today , the difficulties will arise in relation to the licensing of companies up to 2009 .
We need to send a clear message here . We want to roll back bureaucracy and we want to maintain hygiene standards .
They are not diluted by this proposal . I think that is the message which conveys what Parliament wants .
Congratulations on your excellent work , Mr Schnellhardt .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
in writing . - ( HU ) Inspections by the authorities in Hungary , which fall due in the summer , show that there are often certain hygiene problems with casual traders , fast-food outlets and market stalls .
These phenomena are also known in other countries .
I agree that we must deconstruct the unnecessary bureaucracy , mainly if the provisions make it impossible for small businesses to work .
However , reducing the scope of the legislation cannot mean eroding food safety .
In contrast with other continents , food safety regulation in Europe is at a unique , outstanding level .
There may be deficiencies in its implementation , but these problems must not necessarily be solved by weakening regulation .
For this reason , we can only grant exemption from the HACCP and hygiene monitoring by the Union in cases where we can be completely sure that we are not causing any harm by doing so .
As the Hungarians say , it is better to be frightened than to take fright .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission triggered the radioactive risk alert system yesterday following an incident at Krsko in Slovenia , the details of which remain sketchy .
The alert was made public via a procedure that has been described as unusual , but its causes and its consequences are still totally confused and unclear .
We therefore call on the Slovenian Presidency-in-Office and the Commission to maintain the level of transparency urged by the Commission , and to tell the European Parliament and the public what really happened and what is happening now , because a number of rumours are currently circulating which are neither clear nor wholly unambiguous .
We therefore demand the necessary clarification from the European authorities .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like very briefly to endorse my colleague 's request .
We have here a very serious incident in a reactor which has already experienced problems in the past .
Maximum transparency is required , not least because we know that shutting down a reactor and making it safe is no easy matter .
As far as my country is concerned , we are just a few dozen kilometres away from Slovenia , which moreover currently holds the presidency .
We have heard from two speakers on this item and I think that is sufficient .
Vice-President of the Commission . - Mr President , on 1 June , on the basis of information received through the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange ( ECURIE ) system and guided by the principle of precaution , the Commission released a public statement about the alert message from Slovenia at 17.38 local time .
This concerned the loss of coolant that occurred in the primary cooling system of the Krško nuclear power plant in south-west Slovenia .
According to the last information received from the Slovenian authorities , the reactor of the nuclear power plant of Krško was completely shut down on Wednesday , 4 June at 19.30 .
The relatively small leakage remained within the containment building .
The Slovenian authorities have confirmed that there has been no discharge to the environment .
The situation can be considered fully under control .
The Commission immediately transmitted this information to all Member States according to the procedure and released a second public statement .
The information about the incident came from the European Community Urgent Radiological Information Exchange system .
The ECURIE system requires that Member States promptly notify the Commission and all the Member States potentially affected when they intend to take counter measures if necessary , in order to protect the population against the effects of a radiological or nuclear accident .
The European Community needs to immediately forward this notification to all Member States .
All the 27 Member States , as well as Switzerland , have signed the ECURIE agreement .
The Commission emphasises that the ECURIE system is an information-sharing system about nuclear incidents , and the Commission considers that a full transparency approach is the most appropriate response in cases of nuclear incidents .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I recently obtained radiation measurement data from a radioactivity measuring station in Krško which show that in fact , an astonishing peak in radiation levels was recorded the day before the alarm was sounded .
There has to be an explanation for that .
With that , we close that particular item . The Commission will take note .
We will now proceed with our normal business .

Contact-point network against corruption (
- Before the vote :
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , before all of you , as far as possible , vote in favour of this report , I would like to give you some brief information and voice an appeal to the Council which , yet again , is absent .
The Member States and the European Union wish to , and must , take more ambitious and effective action against corruption .
That is why the European Parliament has endorsed the establishment of a contact-point network against corruption .
The lead committee , at least , has voted unanimously in favour of such a move .
The purpose of the network is , firstly , to foster cooperation among the authorities and agencies in the Member States and , secondly , to encourage the exchange of data on effective strategies .
However , the Council proposal before us is quite simply too lacking in ambition and is toothless and thus redundant as it stands .
Parliament has therefore tabled a number of very significant amendments , with unanimous support , as I said , being achieved in committee .
Firstly , OLAF , Europol and Eurojust should be integral parts of this network , which is why we are asking for their participation to be mandatory .
Secondly , the network should submit an annual report to the European Parliament on its activities , with practical proposals on how to improve the prevention and combating of corruption .
Thirdly , the costs of all of the network members should be borne from the Community budget , so as to ensure the independence of the network as a whole .
I therefore urge the Council to incorporate Parliament 's proposals and establish the contact-point network swiftly , for this would give us a unique opportunity finally to achieve a joint strategy for the European Union and establish an appropriate mechanism to combat corruption .

Community system against illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing (
- Before the vote :
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the fisheries sector is experiencing a serious crisis at present , not just because of the increase in the price of diesel , for which sustainable , global proposals must be put forward and not just temporary solutions , but also because of the poor management of fisheries resources , over-fishing by the European fishing fleet and the increase in the number of products of illegal fishing that find their way onto the European market .
This highly lucrative illegal fishing speeds up the deterioration of fish resources and marine ecosystems and destabilises the entire sector , which is feeling the full force of this unfair competition .
The proposal by the European Commission and this report are thus essential elements in the implementation of sustainable , responsible fishing that enables European fishermen to earn a living .
This report was adopted unanimously in the Committee on Fisheries .
Our aim today is to send a strong signal to the Council , to the most closely involved Member States , which must today take full responsibility and implement the necessary rapid , effective measures .
I am counting on your determination .

Well , we have not voted yet , but I hope that you are right .

rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , we have already held the debate on this item in Strasbourg , so I do not need to discuss it further today .
For the so-called 12-day trips , we have achieved an excellent cross-party compromise , also with the submission of the outcomes of the social partners ' negotiations .
Indeed , we could say that we have improved upon the social partners ' compromise here in the House .
I hope that we will thus be able to conclude this matter very successfully with broad support .

I should point out that the event was indeed unplanned , that it involved a component failure , that the plant was not shut down but rather had its operations safely suspended , and that repairs on it are under way .
The operation of the power station is transparent and fellow members can find information on it on the website of the country 's nuclear safety administration .
I should also add that by all performance indicators the Krško nuclear power station is one of the safest nuclear power plants in the world .

Explanations of vote
Oral explanations of vote
Mr President , I would like to put on record that , if we call for the sending of an ESDP border mission to Georgia , then we should also consider in the near future sending an EU police mission to Georgia .
( PL ) Mr President , I cannot support today 's resolution on Georgia because I consider it to be unduly biased .
The situation in the Caucasus is more complex than the text of the resolution now before us suggests .
I should like to remind the House that Georgia has Stalin to thank for its present borders .
The latter are the result of the policy Stalin , who was himself a native of Georgia , conducted in the 1920s and 1930s .
In addition , the policy conducted by the Georgians during the 1990s did a lot to make the authorities in Suckhumi wish to break with Georgia .
Furthermore , I cannot understand why the same Members who only recently so enthusiastically supported the independence of Serbian Kosovo are now denying two historical nations in the Caucasus the right to self-determination .
I do , however , support the international efforts to promote dialogue and the peace process in the Caucasus .
Mr President , I would like to support the original amendment by my colleague , James Elles , who has proposed a new paragraph which declares that the EU recognises the substantial contribution to the protection of the EU from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by the planned deployment of the European-based US missile defence assets .
- ( NL ) Mr President , the resolution on the EU-US Summit does , of course , cover a very large number of different topics .
A number of positions from this resolution are , for me , completely unacceptable , while others are extremely valuable .
I had no choice , therefore , but to abstain .
What I would like to add here , however , is that this resolution should , in the first place , have included a clear passage pointing out to the United States that it should not interfere with the potential expansion of the European Union .
The way in which the United States regularly intervenes to champion the unacceptable Turkish case is , in my view , unacceptable interference in a European affair .
The United States must realise that there is a great difference between the interests of NATO on the one hand , and the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe on the other hand .
Turkey cannot join the European Union because it is not a European country .
As far as this is concerned , we are asking for no more and no less than respect on the part of the United States .

( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am taking the subject of compensation for prisoners at Guantánamo , addressed in this report , as an opportunity to recall that there is another case of civilian and military prisoners still to be resolved : it involves a Member State , indeed a founder member of the European Union .
Yesterday , Italy 's supreme Court of Appeal found in favour of the Italian military and civilian detainees who were seeking compensation for the work they performed in prison camps during the Second World War .
This is an unresolved moral issue , which I have attempted to draw to the attention of the President of this House on several occasions .
I have also raised it with Chancellor Merkel in this House : she stated in her personal capacity that she agreed on the need to settle the matter .
Now that the attempts of the Federal Republic of Germany to delay the decision in court have finally been thwarted , one wonders whether - more than sixty years after the end of the war - Germany will now decide to compensate Italy 's military detainees .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Veraldi very much for his report on young farmers .
I think that we live in a world now where food production is becoming very important again and we have to look to the future .
One of the ways of looking to the future of agriculture is through young farmers .
With the reform of the common agricultural policy , we now have the health check to look particularly at things which will help young farmers , and that is reduction in bureaucracy and abolishing quotas so that young farmers can go into milk production , which is one of the ways that they have always got into farming .
We also have to look a little bit further towards some sort of venture capital schemes , because one of the problems facing young farmers is they have very little collateral when they want to start farming .
Very often banks will not give them the necessary cash to start , so I think we have to look forward to that as well .
I believe that young farmers can link into food production , they can link into niche markets , and they can produce the type of food in the regions that we want and really link into the market place .
I welcome the report and I look forward to supporting young farmers .
( FR ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report because if there is no acceptable future for young farmers , there will be no future for European agriculture .
For many reasons relating to food safety , the supply of quality products , the environment , and preserving our beautiful mountainous landscapes and vineyards , we need to implement positive actions to encourage young people to work in the agricultural sector , to take over the family business .
However , above all I would like to express my satisfaction that , on the basis of my initiative in the Committee on Agriculture , the European Parliament has just added an amendment to draw specific attention to the importance of providing information about the status of partners assisting farmers .
I would like to point out in this regard that in 1997 - more than 10 years ago - this Parliament adopted by a vast majority my report on the status of assisting spouses in the agricultural sector .
In our resolution , we stressed in particular that Member States should ensure that all assisting spouses in the agricultural sector are eligible for insurance cover for retirement pensions .
The Commission did not follow this through .
We have such a system in my country : compulsory insurance .
That example should be followed and we need a framework directive to achieve that .
( DE ) Mr President , I wish to point out that I abstained in the vote on this report , but not because I disagree with the view that young farmers need support .
I strongly believe that they do indeed require support , for young farmers undoubtedly face greater problems than many other farmers .
The reason why I abstained had to do with the vote on paragraph 4 , which makes reference to the situation of young farmers in the so-called new Member States .
In my view , now that almost an entire legislative term has elapsed , it is surely time to drop the reference to the so-called ' new ' Member States and treat them as full Member States of equal value , for in my opinion , they are now well-established as such .
( PL ) Mr President , since the end of the Second World War we have worked hard to achieve the period of peace and stability we now enjoy .
Even so , we are today threatened by terrorism , regional conflicts and international crime .
The European Union 's role in the contemporary world should be to spread peace , democracy , and freedom across the globe .
The Union should also ensure stability , and combat humanitarian disasters and mass violations of human rights .
That is the vision enshrined in the European common foreign and security policy .
We are jointly responsible for ensuring security at global level .
Security now involves more than resolving international conflicts and protecting borders .
A wider interpretation of security is needed .
We must place greater emphasis on the types of security that are not covered by the European common foreign and security policy , namely food security and energy security .
It ought to be borne in mind that the desired objective can only be achieved through cooperation and the exchange of best practice .
Coordinated action is essential both at Member State level and between the various European institutions .
There must also be collaboration with NATO and cooperation with other regional and global organisations .
( EL ) Mr President , I am asking to speak because we have just voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of making EUR 90 million available from the EU 's Solidarity Fund to Greece in the wake of last summer 's disastrous forest fires .
European public opinion was shocked by last summer 's disaster .
Today 's European Parliament decision is a gesture of real solidarity with the regions and citizens who were severely affected last August .
Let me thank all my fellow Members in the Committee on Budgets , and you as well , ladies and gentlemen , for the most interesting and rapid work we have accomplished and for the very successful hearing we have organised .
Allow me to make one final point , Mr President : we are perhaps the only parliament in the world which manages to stifle good news .
Today we have an important decision on the allocation of money to Greek citizens .
For technical rather than political reasons , we have , unfortunately , not been able to make the decision by means of a debate .
I regret this , but the effectiveness of the decision is more important than anything .
( PL ) Mr President , we are facing a tremendous challenge in terms of how to encourage young people to remain in rural areas .
There is also a shortage of people willing to go into farming , and to take on the farms run by their parents .
Young farmers who are starting out come up against many difficulties .
The latter include a shortage of suitable land , high prices , production limits , lack of start-up capital for investment , expensive loans and strict agri-environmental requirements .
Almost one third of Polish farmers are young people under the age of 40 .
As a group , they are open to change , technological progress and innovation .
Young farmers are just like other entrepreneurs .
They are enthusiastic and are not afraid of new challenges .
They are also crucial to our future , because the food security of Europe and of the world depends on them .
They need help to become better qualified , through vocational training and advice .
In addition , efforts should be made to improve the financial conditions for running a business in a rural area , to eliminate the differences in the pace of development of technical and social infrastructure between rural areas and towns .
Above all else , stable conditions for development must be ensured .
Written explanations of vote
in writing . - ( PT ) Following the entry into force of Regulation ( EC ) No 1405 / 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in favour of the smaller Aegean islands , two lines of support ( aid for supply and aid for local production ) were set up .
Certain technical aspects must , however , be corrected in order to fully apply this Regulation and these two lines of support , which is why I support the Commission proposal and the Parish report .
in writing . - We note that the PDAB 3 contains positive measures , such as : to authorise the total figure of € 849m owed by Microsoft for abusing their market position ; to vote through the funds under the EUSF for Greece and Slovenia ; to fully fund the provision of bluetongue vaccine to combat the disease and to provide 50 % of the cost of implementation per Member State and provide savings on salaries and pensions for the Institution 's staff .
However , we also note that the PDAB contains undesirable measures such as the salary increase for the Director of the Gender Institute as well as changes to the establishment plan of the European Economic and Social Committee .
We welcome the criticism of the previous two measures in the Virrankoski report and , while we are against the decision to adopt the PDAB 3 unamended , accept that the raft of positive measures outlined must be voted through this session .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the joint report by my Finnish colleagues Kyösti Virrankoski and Ville Itälä on the third draft amending budget of the European Union for 2008 .
It relates mainly to : the budgeting of the revenue accruing from the Microsoft case ( fine and interest totalling EUR 849 200 000 ) ; the budgeting of savings arising from the smaller than estimated increase for salaries and pensions of officials in 2007 ; the reinforcement of the emergency fund for veterinary measures due to the bluetongue crisis ( EUR 130 million in commitment appropriations , and EUR 63 950 000 in payment appropriations ) ; the creation of budgetary items to accommodate subsidies for four Joint Undertakings : Innovative Medicines Initiative ( IMI ) , Clean Sky , ARTEMIS ( embedded computing systems ) and ENIAC ( European Technology Platform on Nanoelectronics ) , totalling EUR 257.5 million in commitment appropriations and EUR 194.6 million in payment appropriations from the Seventh Framework Programme for Research ; and the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for an amount of EUR 98 million ( forest fires in Greece and floods in Slovenia ) .
in writing . - ( PT ) This draft amending budget covers , among other items , mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund in favour of Greece and Slovenia .
The aim is to help compensate for the damage caused by the forest fires and flooding which seriously affected the populations of these two countries in 2007 .
The draft also aims to reinforce the emergency fund for veterinary measures due to the bluetongue crisis which has affected several Member States , including Portugal .
Accordingly , in order to finance 100 % of the cost of supply of the vaccine and 50 % of the costs incurred in carrying out the vaccination in nine Member States , it is planned to include in the Community budget EUR 130 million in commitments and EUR 63.95 million in payments .
However , we would highlight the inclusion of over EUR 257 million in commitments and EUR 194 million in payments for the creation of new public-private partnerships in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for research , technological development and demonstration activities .
These partnerships cover Innovative Medicines ( IMI ) , ' Clean Sky ' , European Technology Platform on Nanoelectronics and ARTEMIS for Embedded Computing Systems .
At the very least , these initiatives need a public development strategy and public investment that are not dependent on private capital interests .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my Finnish colleague Kyösti Virrankoski on the fourth draft amending budget of the European Parliament for 2008 .
It relates solely to the inclusion in the 2008 budget of the surplus of the 2007 financial year , i.e. EUR 1 528 833 290 .

For 2007 the difference between the revenue received ( EUR 117.4 billion ) and the payments made ( EUR 112.9 billion ) shows a surplus of EUR 4.5 billion , from which must be subtracted the payment appropriations carried over to 2008 , i.e. EUR 3.1 billion .
To this surplus of EUR 1.4 billion the cancelled EUR 0.2 billion of the appropriations carried over from 2006 to 2007 must be added and the negative balance of monetary exchange of EUR 0.1 billion must be subtracted , giving the 2007 surplus of EUR 1.5 billion .
This surplus is primarily due to an under-spending in expenditure of just under EUR 1.6 billion .
I am sorry that , instead of being automatically refunded to the Member States , there was no political debate on allocating this surplus , for example , to financing investment in the trans-European transport networks .
I still remember the difficulties we encountered when trying to find some EUR 3.5 billion to finance the excellent Galileo project .
in writing . - ( PT ) The aim of this amending budget is to include the surplus from the budget year 2007 in the Community budget for 2008 .
This surplus is over EUR 1.528 billion and is due mainly , inter alia , to the delay in approving operational programmes of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund to be transferred to the various Member States .
The draft also includes amounts not used in 2007 under the EU 's common foreign and security policy , such as the ' police mission ' to Afghanistan and the so-called ' civil mission ' to Kosovo .
As regards the situation in Kosovo , we would highlight the illegal and illegitimate military / ' civil ' operation by the US-NATO-EU - in other words , interference , destabilisation , aggression , occupation and unilateral declaration of independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo , with total disregard for international law - and the current ' stalemate in negotiations on the transfer of responsibilities from the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) to EULEX ' ( European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo ) in the United Nations .
Finally , I want to point out that the ' surplus ' from 2007 will reduce the Member States ' contributions to the Community budget , in particular as follows : EUR 300 million less for Germany , EUR 258 million less for the United Kingdom and EUR 233 million less for France .
This is what is known as ' winning every which way ' ...
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , I voted in favour of adoption of the report on the draft amending budget of the European Union No 4 / 2008 for the financial year 2008 ( 9904 / 2008 - C6-0207 / 2008 - .
The report by Mr Virrankoski is thorough and to the point .
I agree with the rapporteur 's stance that the balance of each year 's budget should be entered in the budget for the subsequent financial year as revenue or expenditure .
In the case before us it would be the budget for 2008 .
This should be done through an amending budget to be submitted to the Commission .
in writing . - Conservatives abstained on this report as it forms part of the European objective to develop an area for freedom , security and justice - instead preferring an intergovernmental approach .
in writing . - ( PT ) The European Union strategy on the prevention and control of organised crime indicates the need to develop a comprehensive EU policy against corruption in which all the relevant players must actively participate .
Effective prevention and combating of corruption in Europe therefore depend on the existence of effective and efficient cooperation between the respective authorities and services of the Member States , identifying opportunities , sharing good practices and developing high professional standards .
For this reason I support the idea of formally establishing an anti-corruption network with contact points in the Member States , the activities of which must be fully associated ( within the respective competencies ) with other organisations and agencies playing a fundamental role in this fight , as is the case with OLAF ( European Anti-Fraud Office ) , Europol and Eurojust .
I also support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , Hubert Pirker , in particular the amendment on the need for transparency and information in relation to the activities and recommendations of this network , which must result in the presentation of an annual report to the Commission and the European Parliament .
in writing . - ( RO ) I welcome the Council 's decision regarding the contact points network against corruption , aimed at improving cooperation between the authorities fighting against corruption in the EU .
European cooperation is an essential element in the fight against corruption , especially in the new Member States , where non-governmental organizations and European experts underline the continuing existence of some significant deficiencies , including those within the operation of the legal system .
The last assessment report of GRECO ( The States ' Group against Corruption ) of the Council of Europe with regard to Romania , outlines , for the year 2007 , that our country has implemented only 40 % of the anti-corruption measures advised by the European institutions .
On this occasion , I invite the Romanian rightist government to assume in public the failure of its programmes in the fight against corruption .
I consider that the fight against corruption should be a major objective of the European Union in order to provide its citizens a space of freedom , security and justice .
The European Commission ( by means of OLAF ) , Europol and Eurojust should be part of this network .
Unfortunately , in several of the new EU Member States , including Romania , the fight against corruption is rather used as an election promise and as a political weapon directed against the opposition political parties .
in writing . - ( PT ) The establishment of a ' network of contact points ' in a framework of cooperation between the various Member States , with the aim of sharing experiences and good practices , could form another asset in the fight against corruption in each country .
According to the EC Treaty , the Community and the Member States are responsible for adopting measures to combat fraud and protect the Community 's financial interests .
At Community level there is , for example , a need to guarantee more autonomy and resources for the European Anti-Fraud Office ( OLAF ) .
However , we dislike the fact that this measure is regarded as an embryo and will be used to promote or will be part of the more general objective of developing the so-called ' area of freedom , security and justice ' , in line with the 2005 Hague Programme , in particular by bringing justice and home affairs within the Community system .
This communitisation process is encouraged and ensured by the Treaty now known as the ' Lisbon ' Treaty , by removing from the Member States ' sovereignty ( from their parliaments and other national institutions ) those responsibilities which are at the heart of this sovereignty .
We therefore repeat our reservations about the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor , which is a stage in the process of establishing a future ' European Public Prosecutor 's Office ' based around Europol , Eurojust and OLAF .
in writing . - ( DE ) Corruption is a widespread problem affecting every sector of our society , whether it be the economy , trade unions or the administration .
After cases of corruption at Siemens that ran into billions , the newspapers are now full of articles about the scandal in the Polish football league .
Even the EU hits the headlines again and again , and certainly not in a positive way , with accusations of corruption , mismanagement , mis-spending and so on .
The fact that the Group of States against Corruption ( GRECO ) is there to pool the anti-corruption efforts of all the Council of Europe members is therefore welcome .
We must hope that the right lessons will be learned .
It is not only Bulgaria which must improve its record on combating corruption ; the EU must put its own house in order as well .
We still have far too lax management of EU funds , poor controls , lengthy procedures and virtually no way of recouping EU funding that is paid out incorrectly .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my French colleague Marie-Hélène Aubert , which proposes amending , via the consultation procedure , the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent , deter and eliminate illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing .
It has become urgent to tackle this issue because illegal fishing is a serious problem all over the world .
I unreservedly support this initiative , which , as the rapporteur points out , was proposed by the European Parliament in February 2007 .
I welcome the clarification that access to ports of Member States , the provision of port services , and the conduct of landing , transhipment or on-board processing operations in such ports must be prohibited for third-country fishing vessels except , of course , in cases of distress or force majeure .
As long as it is not too complex , I am in favour of catch certificates to ensure the traceability of fisheries products .
in writing . - ( PT ) Illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing is currently one of the main problems facing the management of marine resources .
It threatens the sustainability of resources and marine biodiversity and has serious economic consequences for fishermen operating within the law .
As the biggest consumer and importer of fish products , the European Community has particular responsibility in the fight against illegal fishing , in the adoption of solutions preventing these practices from continuing and in the pressure which must be brought to bear on the international community to adopt similar measures .
The European Parliament report contains 65 proposed amendments which complement the Commission proposal and go against national interests .
It should be noted that the proposal defines a system applicable to all IUU fishing activities or associated activities , carried out on Community territory or in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States , which were fully debated and defended during the period of the Portuguese Presidency .
This document therefore merits my support .
in writing . - ( PT ) The sustainability of fish stocks is fundamental to guaranteeing the long-term existence of fishing activity and the socioeconomic viability of the fishing sector .
Illegal , unreported and unregulated ( IUU ) fishing threatens this sustainability and calls into question the viability of the sector and fishing communities dependent on it .
As such , it is vital that measures are adopted to reinforce the fight against these illegal activities , in particular by reinforcing control mechanisms in each Member State .
This proposal , which complements measures already laid down within the common fisheries policy , introduces various provisions which aim to curb these practices carried out by vessels flying the flag of a Member State or by vessels from third countries .
The measures proposed therefore include greater control by the Member States at their ports , the requirement for a certificate issued by the flag State indicating that the catch is legal and the creation of a list of vessels involved in IUU fishing .
However , we would reiterate that any future harmonisation of these proposals with a future revision of the Community legislation on control must safeguard the competences of the Member States , particularly for inspections .
We would also reiterate that all the issues relating to penalties come under the competence of each Member State .
in writing . - I welcome my colleague Ms Aubert 's report on illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing .
It is in the interests of all fishing communities that IUU is tackled and the EU has a vital role to play in this .
Nevertheless , the management of fisheries resources should be the responsibility of the fishing nations and the EU must work towards the dismantling of the CFP .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of adoption of the report by Mrs Aubert on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent , deter and eliminate illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing - C6-0454 / 2007 - .
This is a sound report that provides an accurate picture of the problem of illegal fishing , which represents a real threat to the survival of marine resources .
It therefore seems essential to establish a Community system to combat the aforementioned practice .
in writing . - Mrs Aubert 's report on the Community system against illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing is a report that I generally support .
I agree with a number of the rapporteur 's proposals .
To see that Member States provide certification of the legality of the fish that their boats catch , for example , appears fair .
Europe-wide action is required to counter irregular fishing practices and my vote reflects these views .
in writing . - ( FR ) Fishermen in France , Spain and Italy are telling us of their legitimate revolt , their right to make a living , their indignation .
Small farmers are saying the same .
For a year the price of fuel has been stifling our fishermen economically .
This comes on top of the bureaucratic stifling they are experiencing as a result of the quotas , penalties , monitoring and inspections that are transforming the freedom of the high seas into a liquid Soviet Union .
In the light of the tragedy affecting this profession , what are we proposing to these men , these regions , these villages , these local economies ?
Nothing !
Except vague transitional aid , like palliative care .
What is worse , on the day that the Mediterranean fishermen are in Brussels to demand their right to live , here we are discussing additional criminal penalties to combat illegal fishing .
Fishermen are even refused support in terms of VAT and excise duty .
The solution is a European debt compensation fund for fishermen to ensure that they do not have to put up with the inequality in relation to public burdens , generated by the import policy and the domination of the distribution giants .
in writing . - Illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing is a growing problem which requires enhanced cooperation between the EU and the international community if it is to be efficiently tackled .
To a large extent this proposal by the Commission reflects recommendations made by the Fisheries Committee , specifically Ms Aubert 's first report dealing with IUU .
I fully support the main elements of the proposal which include a ban on the importation of IUU fish and the implementation of port controls which would prohibit access of third country vessels suspected of illegal fishing .
Until recently , the EU has focused solely on the regulation of its own fishermen , concentrating on making sure that they do not flout EU laws while the practice of IUU was essentially ignored .
It is encouraging to see that now real efforts are being made by Parliament and the Commission to address this problem .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour of the report tabled by our colleague Marie-Hélène Aubert on a Community system to prevent illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing .
Illegal fishing represents one of the worst threats to the sustainability of fish stocks and marine biodiversity .
The Commission 's proposal is important in enabling the European Union to play a proper leading role within an ever more complex and interconnected sector .
To this end , I think it desirable that the proposal should apply not only to third-country fishing vessels but also to those flying the Community flag , in order to adopt non-discriminatory measures and introduce a common policy within the European Union .
There can be no disputing the importance of a certification system to ensure traceability and make it possible to have a label guaranteeing the fish product , in parallel with harmonised , dissuasive sanctions and a system of checks and inspections to minimise illegal fishing activity .
in writing . - I would like to support the Aubert report and condemn illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing .
in writing . - ? PL ) Illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing , known as IUU , represents a serious problem .
In its effort to deal with the problem actively and effectively , the European Union should benefit from the experience of countries which , although they are not Members of the Union , nonetheless have much stricter provisions aimed at combating illegal fishing .
The countries concerned include Norway , Iceland and Canada .
First and foremost , we must concentrate on dealing with fisheries infringements within the Union .
To date , this has been a major problem .
The next step should involve supporting developing countries wishing to adopt the programme to counter IUU .
Unfortunately , those developing countries do not have sufficient financial resources for the purpose .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed Portuguese colleague Duarte Freitas , which , in accordance with the consultation procedure , proposes amendments to the proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears .
This draft regulation implements the United Nations recommendations of 2006 and applies to EU vessels operating in the high seas in areas that are not regulated by a regional fisheries organisation and thus require flag state regulation .
Between doing nothing and banning everything , I support the third alternative proposed by the European Union : it involves strictly regulating bottom trawling by defining the conservation and management measures adopted by the regional fisheries organisations ( RFOs ) and laying down the discipline that flag states must apply in respect of their vessels when these operate in areas of the high seas not regulated by an RFO .
in writing . - ( PT ) Some marine ecosystems ( such as reefs , seamounts , hydrothermal vents , cold water corals or cold water sponge beds ) are , by their very nature , vulnerable to the use of certain fishing gear .
This proposal aims to protect these ecosystems in the high seas , particularly in areas not regulated by a regional fisheries management organisation .
While fundamentally agreeing with the proposal presented and with the report adopted , we would , however , reiterate that certain aspects of the proposal should be clarified .
For example , as regards the definition of ' vulnerable marine ecosystem ' , the report highlights the need to wait for an FAO ( Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ) definition according to the ' best scientific information available ' , bearing in mind the lack of in-depth scientific knowledge of these ecosystems .
In addition , we would also highlight the need to distinguish between the consequences of using different gear , by carrying out scientific fishing research to determine their potential impacts on stocks and the seabed .
Finally , we also feel it is appropriate to reiterate that the issues of inspections or observation missions on fishing vessels come under the competence of each Member State , particularly as new federal levels to the common fisheries policy have been announced .
in writing . - The Freitas report relates to vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas .
The high seas fall outwith the responsibility of any nations or fisheries organisations and fishing activities have been largely unregulated .
It is appropriate that the EU takes action in this area , given the international nature of the fisheries .
This distinguishes the high seas from coastal waters , where the most appropriate control bodies are in the fishing nations themselves , not the EU institutions .
in writing . - ( FI ) The EU 's Maritime Policy is one of the main initiatives for which the current Commission will be remembered in a good light .
This proposal for a Council regulation on the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the high seas from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing gears is a necessary addition to the EU 's strategy .
When a halt to biodiversity loss was made an objective at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 , the year 2010 was set as the deadline .
Now , to our regret , we have to say that that aim is not going to be achieved in two years ' time .
Although environmental targets have been at the top of the world 's political agenda for more than twenty years now , many factors still threaten maritime biodiversity .
Scientific research has shown that , in spite of the high yields associated with deep sea fishing , poorly organised fishing practices can lead to the destruction of certain species in less than 10 years .
We need to remember that , although such new approaches as these applied in the fishing sector are necessary , woefully little is known about the recovery of deep sea fish species , and all in all the threats to the deep sea ecosystems are much greater .
This proposal for a regulation on the fishing industry is nevertheless a clear and necessary one .
in writing . - The protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems is essential in order that future generations can enjoy the marine environment .
in writing . - ( FR ) With its vote the European Parliament is putting in place strict principles to regulate the activities of Community vessels using bottom fishing gears in the high seas , in zones not regulated by regional fisheries organisations .
Conforming to the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly , the spearhead in this area , the Members are putting an end to the legal vacuum that allowed the irreparable destruction of our marine ecosystems to take place .
I am pleased that the Members of the European Parliament have recognised that the deep-sea ecosystems are an important source of marine biodiversity and that the shift in the fishing effort towards these habitats risked destroying our heritage .
The ecological conscience of the Members of the European Parliament does not seek to make the already difficult work of our fishermen even more complex , nor to increase the bureaucratic pressure .
From now on , fishing activities in these specific areas will require a permit and be subject to a prior assessment , which will be carried out by the Member State , to ensure that they will not cause any significant damage .
The precautionary principle also comes into play here .
Preservation of marine biodiversity will only be guaranteed if it is integrated vertically into the other Community policies , notably the EU 's future maritime policy .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , I welcome the Commission 's objectives of simplifying , stabilising and clarifying trade rules and procedures .
Trade is a key instrument in the current international scenario , serving as a means both of improving the efficiency of international markets and ensuring social and cultural growth for the nations concerned .
Trade agreements between countries can guarantee political stability and lay solid foundations for reasonably durable diplomatic agreements .
They are therefore increasingly becoming the main factors in a world ever more dominated by economic relations which , as well as influencing the flow of cultural exchanges between peoples , help to avoid military confrontation and maintain peace .
Trade therefore represents an extremely important vector of dialogue and an opportunity for economic and social development .
Making trade less rigid means making the economic system more efficient .
Given the significance of the matter in hand , I hope that this House will shoulder its share of responsibility for achieving these objectives .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Audy 's report calls for the harmonisation of import and export procedures with a view to ensuring the smooth application of the European Union 's trade policy and , above all , consistent application at all the entry points to the EU in order to make life easier for businesses .
That might seem logical because we have been part of a customs union for more than 40 years .
However , Mr Audy wants the procedures to be completely harmonised and entrusted to a single European customs service .
The customs authorities are responsible for monitoring the movements of goods and ensuring that they comply with the standards laid down ( product safety , consumer protection , health , environment , etc . ) .
They also have a fiscal function : they apply appropriate customs duties , of course , but they also deal with VAT , which , with all due respect , is still a national tax .
Finally , or perhaps above all , they have a security role to play and they participate in the fight against trafficking of all kinds , notably drug trafficking , in close cooperation with the police services .
It is no surprise that the rapporteur gives priority to the first function , in the name of the virtues of international trade , and underestimates the other two .
That is why we voted against this report .
in writing . - I support the recommendations outlined in Jean-Pierre Audy 's report ' Implementing trade policy through efficient import and export rules and procedures . '
I feel it to be a well balanced report that rightly looks ahead at EC customs law after the Lisbon Treaty and the US ' 100 % scanning law ' .
Indeed , I share the rapporteur 's view that a common approach to the EC customs system would address the inherent difficulties of Member States having responsibility for customs implementation .
I voted in favour of the report .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted for the report regarding the efficient import and export regulations and procedures in the sector of trade policy , which ensure greater efficiency in the customs field , as well as the cooperation among the European customs agencies .
The European Union market is confronted with the counterfeiting and piracy phenomenon .
The losses incurred by the violation of intellectual property rights amounted to EURO 62 million in Romania in 2007 , according to the analysis conducted by the International Alliance of Intellectual Property .
The adoption of this report by the European Parliament and the development of the plan for fighting counterfeiting and piracy on a European level will reduce this loss .
The report welcomes the consensus reached by the Member States and the Commission with regard to the negotiation mandate of an international agreement against counterfeiting ( The Commercial Agreement against Counterfeit ) , as this agreement is of major importance for the EU trade strategy .
As the European regulations for consumers ' protection , mainly the ones concerning health and the safety , are applied for all products within the EU market , the Commission and the Member States are asked to take all the necessary measures so as to effectively monitor a high level of protection for consumers .
in writing . - ( PL ) Over 2 billion tonnes of goods pass through the Union 's air and sea ports every year .
The customs services deal with in excess of 100 million customs declarations .
By so doing , they are protecting the health and safety of European Union citizens .
The customs services are also involved in practices connected with counterfeiting goods .
This is a growing and increasingly dangerous phenomenon concerning not only fashionable luxury goods but also medicines , toothpaste and skincare products .
The customs services are seizing counterfeit spare parts for motor vehicles , such as braking systems .
Counterfeit sunglasses can cause damage to the wearer 's eyesight .
Combating these practices and putting a stop to them will contribute to better health protection and improved security for the citizens .
The customs authorities introduced appropriate security checks to protect the internal market .
Working in close cooperation with important trading partners at international level , they protect international freight transport against the smuggling of goods linked to terrorist activity .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed German colleague Reimer Böge , which proposes approving as it stands the Commission proposal to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund to assist Slovenia and Greece , which in 2007 were affected by floods and forest fires respectively , to the tune of around EUR 98 million , which should be the subject of an amended budget adopted in parallel .
In order to avoid any delay in the provision of financial assistance in the case of disasters , I support the recommendation in the report that the Commission propose amending budgets aimed solely at mobilising this Fund , use of which must not exceed EUR 1 billion per year under the current Interinstitutional Agreement .
in writing . - ( PT ) The severe forest fires that devastated Greece in the summer of 2007 and the serious flooding in Slovenia in September 2007 justify this ( second ) mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for 2007 .
This Fund has an annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion , of which around EUR 163 million has already been used at the request of the United Kingdom following the floods that hit that country in 2007 .
An amount of around EUR 837 million is therefore still available .
The proposal adopted today provides for the allocation of nearly EUR 90 million to Greece and around EUR 8 million to Slovenia .
This is peanuts compared with the damage suffered by the populations of these two countries which , in the case of Greece , exceeds EUR 2 billion .
However , there is at least one question that must be answered : how is it possible that it is only now , nearly one year after the disasters suffered by these populations , that EU funding is being made available ?
Clearly there is something wrong here ...
We would point out that we have presented proposals to speed up the procedures for mobilising this Fund , to ensure that regional disasters remain eligible and to recognise , within this Fund , the specific nature of natural disasters in the Mediterranean , such as drought and fires .
in writing . - ( PL ) The proposal to mobilise the Solidarity Fund once again is contained in amending budget No 3 / 2008 .
The previous application benefiting the United Kingdom ( EUR 162 million ) together with the application currently under consideration to benefit Greece and Slovenia ( totalling EUR 98 million ) leaves considerable scope for manoeuvre in the second half of 2008 , bearing in mind that the annual ceiling for Solidarity Fund resources is approximately EUR 1 billion .
Furthermore , other formal requirements contained in the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 have been met .
The Committee on Budgets was able to obtain all necessary additional clarification at the meeting in May attended by representatives of the countries that suffered natural disasters in 2007 .
The countries concerned were Greece , which was affected by forest fires , and Slovenia , which was affected by floods .
As is customary in such cases , the only concerns relate to the time it takes for the Union 's institutions to react .
This issue has been raised ad nauseam .
The applications by Greece and Slovenia were received in October and November of 2007 .
The amending budget was submitted by the European Commission on 14 April 2008 .
Although this does indeed indicate that the process was swifter than in the past , the pace remains unsatisfactory .
There is therefore all the more reason to highlight the swift response by the European Parliament , and the good cooperation between the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Budgets , regarding favourable consideration of the proposal concerning aid for the affected countries .
in writing . - I welcome the action taken to help Greece and Slovenia recover from 2007 's forest fires .
In pledging EUR 89.7 million and EUR 8.3 million to Greece and Slovenia respectively the EU has shown that it is committed to fostering solidarity among its members .
I therefore voted in support of Reimer Böge 's report on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund .
in writing . - ( DE ) Natural disasters cause not only immeasurable suffering and numerous deaths ; they also destroy essential permanent infrastructure such as electricity transmission lines , roads and bridges .
Besides caring and providing for the injured , it is therefore essential to repair and remedy the damage as swiftly as possible .
Given that such damage is often extensive , it was decided in 2002 that in such cases , the EU should provide the victims with financial support .
Of course it is important to ensure that the monies are not used inappropriately , but this should not result in a 12-month delay , on average , in the disbursement of these funds , as noted by the Court of Auditors .
in writing . - ( PT ) The general aim of the proposal presented by the European Commission is to continue the EU-wide liberalisation of scheduled and occasional coach and bus services - in particular between the various countries within the EU and between these and third countries , including cabotage operations - as from 1 January 2009 .
The following are some of the many aspects that we reject :
those aiming to limit the competence of a state to manage passenger road transport on its territory , particularly in defence of this public service ( not to be confused with the so-called ' public interest service ' which is privately owned , but financed with public funds ) ;
removing the concept of ' working time ' and solely referring to ' driving time ' and ' rest periods ' , which aims to increase the exploitation of drivers ;
the ( re ) introduction of the ' twelve-day derogation ' , in other words the possibility of deferring the weekly rest period for 12 consecutive periods of 24 hours which , in our opinion , could lead to situations endangering the safety of road transport professionals and passengers .
Look at the situations that already occur under more restrictive rules with regard to working time and rest periods .
Hence the reason for our vote against the proposal !
in writing . - ( PL ) I should like to express my support for the report by Mr Grosch on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services ( recast ) .
The aim of this report is to identify the best possible solution for both regular and occasional services .
Its main objective is to simplify legal provisions concerning the provision of bus and coach services .
At present , access to this market is governed by two Regulations , pursuant to which occasional international transport services have been liberalised .
In the case of regular international services , there is still a clear need for simplifying measures to be introduced regarding the issue of authorisations to provide such services in all Member States of the European Union .
The legal framework should be streamlined , notably by merging the aforementioned Regulations , tightening cooperation between the Member States and introducing sensible provisions .
Such measures would greatly simplify the international flow of goods and improve control , as a result of harmonisation of documentation and procedures .
I am also pleased to note the proposed simplification measures relating to regular transport services in border areas .
The matter of transit journeys by coach and bus has been dealt with well too .
If such transit takes place , the competent authorities in the relevant Member State will only be informed that authorisation has been granted by those European Union Member States affected by the particular transport service .
in writing . - ( PT ) The Grosch report is one of a series of texts on road transport activity and its rules in the European area .
This recasting aims to reinforce the capacity and competence of national authorities for issuing or withdrawing licences to or from a carrier in the event of serious infringements of Community legislation .
Instances of serious infringement and also the conditions for establishing non-discriminatory sanctions proportional to the seriousness of the infringement have therefore been clarified .
To help with assessment , Member States will therefore have access to a register of serious infringements committed by road transport undertakings , linked to the national register of these undertakings .
I believe that this recasting will result in more administrative simplification and greater legal security for this economic activity and also for undertakings complying with the rules .
Will this mean that we can finally hope for a real road transport market for coach and bus services that is open and competitive and that guarantees the most stringent conditions in terms of road safety ?
in writing . - ( IT ) I am voting in favour of the report put forward by our colleague Mathieu Grosch on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services .
I agree with the proposal to liberalise coach and bus services within the Member States , not only so as to simplify the European legislative framework in this area but also so as to enhance cooperation among EU countries .
In order to do this it is necessary to standardise identity and identification documents throughout the united Europe , in order to facilitate the checks that a Member State is entitled to carry out when passengers , as well as transiting through that state , engage in cabotage operations .
To this end , I hope that the authorities of Member States whose territory is crossed will be given prior information .
in writing . - ( RO ) The new amended form of the report observes the agreement between the social partners regarding the reintroduction of derogation from the 12 resting days for coach drivers carrying out international passengers transport .
I voted for amendment 31 establishing the conditions applicable for drivers employed in an international transport service for the delay of the weekly rest period of up to 12 consecutive periods of 24 hours which follow the period preceding the weekly rest .
These conditions are : the international occasional transport service must include at least 24 hours in a Member State or a third country , other than the one in which the service started ; the weekly rest period after the application of derogation must always be at least a normal weekly rest of 45 hours ; a compensatory rest period of 24 hours is effectuated constantly before the end of the third week following the derogation implementation ; in the case that the driving period is carried out without interruption between the hours 22.00-6.00 , the vehicle is provided with two drivers or the driving period is reduced to three hours ; starting with January 1st 2014 , the implementation of this derogation is possible only in the case of vehicles provided with recording equipment according to the European regulations .
We have chosen to vote for this report .
The hygiene package has given rise to debate in several Member States , including Sweden .
In the great majority of cases , however , the problem has not been the legislation in itself but the implementation of the legislation by the national authorities .
The EU is sacrificing public health for the sake of the profits of European monopolies , which are demanding fewer checks and restraints .
A typical example of EU policy is the latest food scandal of sunflower oil mixed with petroleum , with its disastrous effects on health .
Instead of taking measures to step up restraints on the uncontrolled proceedings of multinationals , the EU and the Member States ' governments are merely intervening on exports of sunflower oil from Ukraine .
At the same time , the EU Food Safety Directive is allowing oils and other liquid cargoes intended for human consumption to be carried by container ships transporting petroleum oils and other toxic fluids .
On the pretext of reducing administrative costs for small businesses , the Commission proposes to make yet another exception to the Food Safety Directive , which in itself is inadequate .
Checks on food will be made even more difficult because large multinationals are using monopolies to hide behind in order to avoid any responsibility while carrying on activities that are dangerous and very damaging to public health .
Safe food , in sufficient quantities and at low prices for the workers , is unlikely to be available unless there is a shift in EU policy that serves the interests of the food multinationals and the increase in their profits .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted against the Schnellhardt report on the hygiene of foodstuffs because I consider that the Commission 's proposed amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 852 / 2004 , aimed at exempting small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the food sector from the application of the HACCP ( Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point ) system , is not currently justified given that to date there is no evidence of specific problems with the application of this procedure .
I consider that 2009 , the date when this Regulation must be reviewed , would be the right time to propose any amendments , if they are justified .
in writing . - ( PT ) The European Parliament today adopted , at first reading , a report on the exemption of food business operators from the Regulation on the hygiene of foodstuffs .
This exemption shall apply to micro-enterprises which sell foodstuffs and not to supermarkets or franchised supermarket chains .
Experience in Portugal shows that this exemption is essential both to defend traditional gastronomy and its associated habits and customs , and to protect family enterprises , which represent a large part of the workers in this sector and which are the ones facing the most difficulties given the competitive imbalance with large groups .
Furthermore , the introduction , application and maintenance of processes based on the principles of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point ( HACCP ) system , which may be important for large enterprises to guarantee food safety , cannot be equally applied to large and small enterprises , particularly in the catering sector .
While it is true that the legislation on foodstuffs must guarantee a high level of protection for the lives and health of people and the interests of consumers , this cannot be confused with the end of traditions and attacks on the gastronomic culture of each country and each region .
in writing . - The EU 's regulations on the hygiene of foodstuffs are of importance across the Member States .
They have however at times proven to be somewhat burdensome on smaller businesses .
I welcome the proposals to exempt micro-enterprises and accordingly voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report .
in writing . - ( SK ) I voted for the report by Mr Horst Schnellhardt because it will result in the reduction of bureaucratic burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises in the food industry , in particular for micro-enterprises ( bakeries etc . ) , it will make business activities more attractive and it will create new jobs .
The report introduces several changes concerning small and medium-sized enterprises producing and selling food , operating on regional and local markets .
These are not veterinary regulations .
When considering the food hygiene package , Parliament wanted above all to ensure the highest possible level of food safety and at the same time to establish a practicable and flexible control mechanism .
Those small and medium-sized enterprises that can prove that there are no hazards in the area of food hygiene and that the hygiene of foodstuffs is regularly controlled are exempt from HACCP procedures .
The HACCP system provides a hazard analysis and a critical control point method .
It was developed in the US in the 1960s by NASA , when the Agency needed to ensure 100 % safety of all foodstuffs and nutritional products .
In 1992 the system was incorporated into European legislation .
The Food Code of the Slovak Republic refers to HACCP as ' Proper Production Practice ' .
Preparing documentation is complicated and owners of micro-enterprises are discouraged from doing business by unjustifiable bureaucracy .
Since the hygiene regulations in Slovakia are far stricter than those in the 15 old Member States , it is necessary to harmonise the hygiene rules across the entire EU .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I support Horst Schnellhardt 's proposal on the hygiene of foodstuffs .

This proposal addresses two distinct problems : firstly , reducing red tape in respect of transport costs and conditions , and secondly , adjusting the rules exempting micro-enterprises from the requirements deriving from the HACCP system , aimed at guaranteeing the maximum degree of food safety and ensuring a high level of protection for human life and health , as well as for consumer interests .
I agree that the HACCP procedures should remain in place : their removal would lessen the likelihood of achieving these objectives , given that the procedures serve the interests of food business operators , enhance food safety standards and levels of responsibility , and guarantee fair competition and flexibility in the free movement of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs intended for consumption within the Community .
This amendment should , lastly , be extended to and approved by all Member States without exception , laying down safety requirements in no uncertain terms .
in writing . - ( NL ) Mr President , if we mean well toward small and medium-sized enterprises , we have to pass laws that they are also able to comply with .
That also applies to the hygiene regulations for the food sector .
Last year the Commission presented a proposal to amend the provisions of Regulation ( EC ) No 852 / 2004 to bring them more into line with what is achievable for the smallest enterprises .
The amendments proposed by the Commission are very useful because they still require small companies to meet hygiene standards but at the same time they relieve them of red tape and of the obligations that are genuinely not feasible for small businesses .
On the one hand , it is unfortunate that Parliament has not completely followed the Commission .
On the other hand , I voted for the final report because we have been able to make some progress towards a solution .
I still regret the fact that the responsibility is being shifted on to the Member States .
Member States will now have to take up their responsibility and allow their small and medium-sized enterprises to depart from the strict HACCP requirements .
in writing . - ( RO ) The Regulation No 11 on eliminating discrimination in terms of tariffs and transport conditions requires carriers to hold a transport document which should contain , among others , the distances , routes and borders passage points .
In the field of transportations , the proposal aims at the reduction of certain obligations to provide statistics in the transportations field .
Yet , as far as this modification is concerned , only the European Parliament has been consulted .
I voted for amendment no .
12 , submitted by the European Socialist Group , afferent to Regulation ( EC ) No 852 / 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs , in which the competent bodies are allowed to exempt economic agents in the foods sector from the implementation of one or several of the imposed measures , provided that these bodies are capable of proving that there is no risk that must be avoided , or that all identified risks are sufficiently and regularly controlled by means of application of the general and special requirements of hygiene of foodstuffs .
This refers to bakeries , butcheries , fruit and vegetables shops and , mainly , to market stands .
I regret the fact that this amendment did not gather the necessary majority .
The quality of goods and services is becoming an issue of increasing importance to European society .
Quality is a factor in competition between enterprises .
One way is which quality is demonstrated is through possession of the relevant certificate of compliance with quality standards .
The most widespread and most respected standards are the ISO 9000 series standards .
The HACCP system was officially accepted by the World Health Organisation in 1975 .
In 1993 it was adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission as an appropriate tool with which to regulate the production of food .
It is considered that a properly implemented HACCP system , together with a quality control system compliant with the ISO 9000 standards is the best way to ensure the provision of healthy food .
The fundamental aim of the method and the HACCP system based upon it is to prevent dangers throughout the food chain and ensure the safety of the final product , whilst providing for appropriate reactions should problems arise .
in writing . - ( PT ) Directive 96 / 22 / EC prohibits the use of thyrostatic substances , stilbenes , stilbene derivatives , their salts and esters , which are on list A of Annex II , for administration to ' animals of all species ' , meaning to both animals or animal products used for human consumption as well as to pets .
However , the two products on list B of Annex II may be used under certain conditions .
The Commission 's amendment proposes :
to exclude pet animals from the scope of this Directive , which means that prohibitions on the use of certain substances simply do not apply any more to them and they may therefore be treated with these substances ;
that the hormone oestradiol 17 ß which was temporarily allowed to be used for farm animals for the treatment of foetus maceration or mummification or for pyrometer will now be banned completely .
The fourth application for oestrus induction in cattle , horses , sheep or goats was granted only until October 2006 and has already expired .
This substance is considered to be carcinogenic and alternatives now exist on the market so that the use of this hormone is redundant and can be banned completely .
in writing . - ( PT ) The Commission proposes to exclude pet animals from the scope of Council Directive 96 / 22 / EC which would enable their treatment with substances having a thyrostatic action and with beta-agonists .
This important measure is intended to reduce the suffering of pet animals and will allow the use , for example , of substances having a thyrostatic action for the treatment of hyperthyroidism in these animals .
However , the most recent developments in scientific assessment tell us that using these substances is economically unattractive in animal production for human consumption or can be replaced with alternative substances .
It is therefore proposed to prohibit entirely the use of oestradiol 17 ß and its esters in animal production for human consumption , putting an end to the various derogations that still exist today .
I would point out that these hormones , when used to promote growth , can be carcinogenic to human beings and that the existing derogations can finally be ended as these hormones can be replaced with alternative substances without any problems .
These changes will ensure a high level of protection for consumers of meat and animal derivatives while at the same time allowing the treatment and reduction of suffering of pet animals .
in writing . - ( PL ) I support the report by Mrs Scheele on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council directive 96 / 22 / EC concerning prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyreostatic action and of beta agonists .
This report represents an effort to find an optimum solution catering both for the need to protect human beings , the consumers , and the need to ensure animal welfare .
The report also takes account of scientific research in this area of veterinary science .
In particular , I welcome the complete ban on the use of the hormonal substance named oestradiol 17 β in the rearing of animals raised for meat production .
I believe the ban is entirely appropriate .
Priority must be given to the effort to achieve an appropriate level of food safety , especially bearing in mind that the products referred to in the Directive can cause serious cancers in human beings .
On the other hand , the proposed changes provide for effective treatment of pet animals , such as those suffering from hyperthyroidism or other distressing conditions .
There is therefore provision for the health of both pet and farm animals .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my German colleague Helmuth Markov , adopted unanimously in the Committee on International Trade , which proposes amending , in accordance with the consultation procedure , the proposal for a Council regulation applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 and amending various Regulations .
This proposal for a regulation conforms to the 2004 guidelines on the role of the GSP for the 10-year period between 2006 and 2015 , which introduced a number of new objectives , such as targeting preferences on countries that most need it , enlarging the product coverage of the GSP to products of interest for developing countries , making the graduation system more transparent and stable and introducing a new special incentive scheme to encourage sustainable development and good governance .
I fully support the report 's call for the European Parliament to be more closely involved in this GSP policy , which is crucial for the countries that need it and which costs us EUR 3.5 billion each year in loss of customs revenue .
in writing . - ( IT ) In a society now dominated by a globalised economic market , in a world where three billion human beings live on less than two dollars a day and more than one billion survive on just one dollar , stimulating economic development in the so-called third world by means of appropriate trade policies is a duty incumbent upon the Community institutions .
In order to achieve this shared goal , we must seek adequate means of both bringing about an improvement in the economic circumstances of developing countries and gradually , increasingly , integrating them into the world market .
In addition , over and above purely economic factors such as market share , other criteria must be borne in mind , such as the beneficiaries ' levels of development and commitment to embark on the road to democracy .
Encouragement should moreover be given to those products which are often distinctive of a given country 's economy .
While pursuing these goals , however , we must take care not to restrict the developing countries ' economies to producing a limited range of goods , especially if these are low added-value products , since that would hamper - rather than foster - development and economic growth in those countries .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Markov 's report on the system of preferential customs duties granted to developing countries is an act of faith in the beneficial effects of global free trade , particularly for the poorest countries .
However , when I turn on the television and watch the news it seems that it is in those countries that famines are taking place .
It seems that it is the choice of the major export crops , to the detriment of the local crops designed to ensure food independence , that is one of the causes of these tragedies .
It seems that 38 years of preferential systems have not made much of an impact on the economic and social situation of these countries and their populations .
It seems that if a system takes so long to generate the benefits purported by its ideological supporters , it if leaves so many people behind , in all countries , if it accentuates inequalities and poverty , it is no longer time to modify it along the way ; it is quite simply time to abandon it .
in writing . - ( PT ) As we have highlighted previously , the current Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP ) is based on a logic that is in itself contradictory .
In other words , development is promoted in order to liberalise international trade through a model promoting exports , regulated at world level , with a ' centre ' and a ' periphery ' .
This logic prevents fair international relations and aid for the development of the endogenous factors of less economically developed countries , without which - together with the theft of foreign debt and the imposition of the interests of large multinationals from the US , EU and Japan - these countries will continue to have a peripheral and subordinate status .
Trade is a component of development but is far from being the most important .
The GSP guarantees preferential access for products originating from a very wide range of countries .
The GSP applies to products of particular importance for Portugal ( canned tuna , tomato concentrate , textiles and clothing ) .
Textiles and clothing are particularly affected , especially due to the existence of a high graduation threshold for the sector .
This and other negative aspects need to be changed , otherwise there will be serious consequences for the national productive sector which will result in social and economic consequences .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , the treatment meted out to Georgia by Russia is simply unacceptable by international standards .
It is abundantly clear that Russia is exploiting its economic influence in many EU countries to see how far it can pursue its neo-imperialistic ambitions .
It is doing its utmost to block all relations between Georgia and the West .
I wish to stress once again that EU or UN forces should immediately replace Russia 's so-called peacekeeping armed forces in Abkhazia .
The European Union should constantly demonstrate full support for Georgia , as has been the case in the House today .
In addition , the Union should systematically strengthen cooperation and immediately introduce visa facilitation measures for Georgians , especially now that fully democratic elections have been held .
The resolution adopted today is an expression of precisely that kind of support for a sovereign Georgia .
I am glad that it was at the initiative of Law and Justice Members that a debate was held in the European Parliament at the beginning of May .
That debate resulted in today 's resolution , which represents Europe 's official stance on the issue of Georgia .
in writing . - ( PT ) Among the various important aspects that could be highlighted in relation to this resolution , I must point out the profound hypocrisy of those who are currently reiterating their full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a state when they are the same ones who instigated and supported the illegal and illegitimate ' operation ' by the US-NATO-EU against Yugoslavia .
This operation was an example of interference , destabilisation , aggression and military occupation and culminated in the unilateral declaration of independence of the Serbian province of Kosovo , with total disregard for international law .
Once again we are seeing clear signs - which we reject - of interference and reinforcement of the presence , including the military presence , of the US-NATO-EU in this region which is increasingly important in geostrategic terms .
See , for example , the conclusions of the recent NATO Summit in Bucharest where a political commitment was made on the accession of Georgia to this offensive military alliance .
See , for example , the calls for ' deeper European involvement ' and ' bolstering the international presence in the conflict zone by sending an ESDP border mission ' ( in other words , a mission from the EU which contains 21 member countries of NATO and in which the ESDP - European Security and Defence Policy - is the European pillar of NATO ) .
See , for example , the initiatives to set up ' broad and comprehensive free trade agreements ' between the EU and Georgia .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of adoption of the resolution on Georgia .
The people of Georgia need our support and solidarity .
Solidarity is not so necessary when all is well and everyone is happy .
It is very much needed , however , in times of difficulty and hardship .
The people of Georgia are currently experiencing hardship .
We should not only show the people of Georgia our support , but also do all in our power to protect them and their country from a conflict with potentially tragic consequences .
There are strong indications that Georgia and Russia were recently on the brink of armed conflict .
It is our duty to convince all sides to opt for peaceful political solutions .
I am convinced that even the most difficult problems can be resolved through negotiation , by seeking compromise and being guided by the principles of goodwill .
I hope too that the international community will actively and effectively support the mediation process and the search for a permanent and just solution acceptable to both sides .
In addition , the situation in Georgia demonstrates how important our neighbourhood policy is for our policy as a whole .
This is particularly true of the Eastern dimension of the neighbourhood policy .
in writing . - ( FR ) Our message is clear : we are denouncing the dangerous escalation of the conflict in this region and reiterating the EU 's support for Georgia .
The recent developments in Georgia , and more specifically in Abkhazia , are of great concern .
A deterioration of the links between Georgia and Russia could be the start of a negative spiral for the Caucasus region .
I was part of the delegation that visited Georgia to observe the elections on 21 May 2008 and I witnessed the intense efforts being made by Tbilisi in its democratisation process .
This significant progress , which I observed when monitoring 14 polling stations in the Gori area , should not obscure the difficulties that persist in the region .
Much remains to be done and the EU will have to play its role , over and above observing the elections , by providing long-term support for a reform process .
The EU must learn from the Balkan experience : it cannot stand idly by when faced with a conflict on its doorstep .
In approving this resolution , I am calling on the two sides in the conflict to refrain from carrying out any further acts that could result in an escalation of the tension .
It is essential to focus our efforts on rebuilding dialogue and persuading Russia to withdraw its troops from Abkhazia .
in writing . - British Conservatives reject much of Paragraphs 6 and 8 which refer to ESDP missions .
We are against ESDP in principle and do not regard the EU as the appropriate organisation to be undertaking security missions in far-off areas of potential conflict .
Furthermore we are disappointed that NATO 's Bucharest Summit did not extend the invitation for Georgia to join NATO 's Membership Action Plan .
We have chosen to abstain on recital E. The CFSP and the common security and defence policy will probably require increased budgetary resources in future , but we do not want to pre-empt the forthcoming mid-term review of the long-term budget by taking a view on individual parts of it at this stage .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by my esteemed Polish colleague Jacek Saryusz-Wolski on the common foreign and security policy ( CFSP ) and the European Security and Defence Policy ( ESDP ) , which have helped to reinforce European identity and the role of the European Union in the world .
I agree that the CFSP must become more democratically legitimate by allowing Parliament to exercise real control over this policy and speak with a single voice as well and by emphasising various priorities : the causes of the current insecurity in Europe ( terrorism , organised crime ) , energy security , fight against climate change and sustainable development , improvement in the stability of neighbouring regions , crisis management and conflict prevention / resolution , non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , migration management , and promotion of human rights and civil freedoms throughout the world .
The first of the geographical priorities must be ensuring stability in the Western Balkans and strengthening the dialogue with Serbia and Kosovo .
I support the idea that the European Parliament should put forward specific proposals on the financing and budgetary control of the future European External Action Service ( EEAS ) .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Saryusz-Wolski on his report concerning the European Union 's common foreign and security policy .
I agree with the rapporteur that it is not enough simply to speak of a common foreign policy .
We have to prove that the European Union is prepared to adopt a common position on crucial issues .
In relation to important matters such as the aggressive energy policy conducted by Russia , the events in Kosovo and the case of Tibet , the Union has recently demonstrated that the CFSP remains a distant goal .
As long as the European Union allows its credibility on the international arena to be undermined , as in the aforementioned cases , and as long as individual Member States continue to act on a bilateral basis , implementation of the CFSP will continue to be merely an aim .
There is nothing to be gained from yet another provision on common policy if we do not begin to speak with one voice on matters of vital interest to Europe .
in writing . - I will be voting in favour of this report .
I did vote for Green Amendment 7 that complains of President Sarkozy 's ' sales offensive on nuclear technology worldwide ' .
I am afraid this macho technology drives far too much of French foreign policy .
The rumour is that the reason France is the only Member State not to have established diplomatic relations with North Korea is not through any concern with human rights but because of a failure in 2001 of the then South Korean Government to promise the French nuclear industry a disproportionate share of the nuclear contracts associated with the KEDO project to build two light water reactors in North Korea in exchange for the freezing of their graphite-moderated reactor at Taechon capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium .
France 's nuclear obsession makes us all less safe .
I voted ' no ' because I do not want the EU 's common foreign policy and armed forces to be strengthened , with all that that entails .
in writing . - I fully support my own group 's Amendment 7 to the Saryusz-Wolski report expressing concern at President Sarkozy 's sales offensive on nuclear technology worldwide , which could lead to enhanced nuclear proliferation .
The people of Scotland take a huge interest in nuclear issues , given that the UK 's nuclear weapons are based on our territory .
Scotland rejects the London government 's plans to build a new generation of nuclear weapons and I fully support the Scottish Government 's work to ensure these weapons do not come into existence .
in writing . - Mr Saryusz-Wolski 's report on the annual report on the CFSP seeks to define the common values and priorities regarding Europe 's global role .
With the Lisbon Treaty , the EU would have a more effective and coherent voice on international affairs and I welcome the fact that the report deals with the treaty 's contribution in this domain .
I voted in favour of the report .
in writing . - British Conservatives do not wish to see British foreign policy subsumed by the EU .
We reject the Treaty of Lisbon , any idea of an EU ' foreign minister ' or an EU seat on the UN Security Council , and any EU role in defence .
We therefore voted against the Report .
Of course we welcome opportunities for 27 nations to speak with one voice where this is wholly consistent with British foreign policy interests .
Similarly , we support better coordinated humanitarian action , and a more robust approach in dealing with abhorrent regimes in Zimbabwe , Burma , and elsewhere .
We have abstained in the vote on all parts which refer to NATO , since we come from a country which has no military alliances .
As regards Amendment 14 , we think that it is factually incorrect to say that the Treaty does not permit military intentions .
Even now EU resources are being used for military operations , but not for a common EU defence force .
in writing . - We generally vote against EU legislation and indeed voted against this report as a whole .
However , we felt that there were a number of amendments we could vote for .
We voted yes to Amendments 10 and 12 , as they reject the militarisation of the EU .
We too oppose the militarisation of the EU .
These amendments did not call on the Commission to act , nor did they acknowledge the authority of the Commission or EU .
They were simple statements that happened to agree with us on this particular question .
Therefore , we could vote for these two amendments without compromising our overall stance to both this report as a whole and EU legislation in general .
in writing . - ( PT ) If you had any doubts about the real meaning , ambition and scope of the so-called Treaty ' of Lisbon ' , you would only have to carefully read the resolutions on the ' ESDP ' ( European Security and Defence Policy ) and the ' CFSP ' ( common foreign and security policy ) , adopted by a majority of this House , for these doubts to disappear .
The forces promoting ' European integration ' - namely the major financial and economic groups , the social democrats and the right - are trying to affirm the EU as an imperialist bloc under the control of its major powers .
In addition to confirming the EU 's policy of interference ( as seen in the ' missions ' to Afghanistan , Chad / Central African Republic , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Kosovo and Guinea-Bissau ) and operational capability ( ' to undertake rapidly and simultaneously two ESDP military operations ' ) , this report is a real guide to militarisation and militarism .
Just as an example , the report highlights the following objectives : extension of the ' European Security Strategy ' ; military dimension of ' civil missions ' ; militarisation of ' development aid ' and ' development ' as an instrument of interference ; reinforcement of means of military transport ( A400M military aircraft and helicopters ) ; increase in expenditure on ' defence ' and military actions , including using the Community budget ; operational capability to conduct EU military actions , and coordination of projects and the armaments industry .
These , among many others , are the reasons why we voted against this report .
I voted against the report because I do not want the EU 's common foreign policy to be strengthened .
Besides , I am against the militarisation of the EU .
in writing . - British Labour MEPs voted in favour of this report which looks at the implementation of the European Security Strategy and the continuing role of ESDP missions .
In particular Labour MEPs welcome the emphasis in this report on the better functioning of civilian ESDP missions .
Labour MEPs voted against the text of paragraph 39 looking at the role of Eurocorps .
While the UK is not involved in Eurocorps , and this force has never been used , Labour MEPs feel it important to emphasise that there are no standing forces under permanent EU command , and we believe that there is no need for such structures .
in writing . - I welcome Mr Kuhne 's report on the annual report on the implementation of the European Security Strategy and ESDP .
I would agree with the rapporteur that the Lisbon Treaty reinforces the Union 's powers by giving the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy a more important role .
The international nature of the security issues Member States face requires greater European cooperation .
I would therefore welcome the introduction of a solidarity clause among Member States on such issues .
I voted in favour of the report .
in writing . - ( IT ) Europe 's security needs have changed .
The risk of territorial aggression , implicit in the classic conception of defence , has largely been superseded by the dangers arising at regional borders in areas adjoining the territory of the EU .
Added to that there is the threat of terrorism and the huge upsurge in migration flows , the radicalisation of fundamentalists and extremists of various kinds , the increase in trafficking and the risk of a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
For the European Union it is not just a matter of equipping ourselves with the means of acting independently to manage international crises , but of establishing a fully-fledged European defence system .
However , in the desirable process of expanding its external action capabilities , the EU must not confine itself to the military dimension alone : it must undertake to develop , in parallel , civil crisis management mechanisms involving action by the police , civil administrators , the judiciary , civil protection officers and so on .
The common security policy must therefore be strengthened in order to give the Union a key role on the international geopolitical scene , a role which is distinct but not distant from that of NATO .
On this optimistic note I am today voting in favour of the report by Mr Saryusz-Wolski .
in writing . - ( PT ) The European Union 's ambition in terms of security and defence is clearly less than its ability , and this is not just due to the traditional problem of coordinating and cooperating on external priorities .
There is also a central issue that must be tackled .
We know that the external dimension and the establishment of operational capabilities lack personnel , availability and cooperation .
However , they also require a public perception of the need for , and usefulness of , this cooperation .
We must construct this strategy based on cooperation - by specifically investing in interoperability and by creating operational capabilities on the ground - but it is particularly public support that is often missing from this dimension of our policies .
Recognition of the need for , and the importance and effectiveness of , the security and defence dimension depends , to a huge extent , on public support which must be generated , and this support depends , to a large extent , on our efforts .
Finally , I would stress the importance of remembering that the Atlantic Alliance is a basic pillar of European security and defence which must not and cannot under any circumstances be disregarded .
in writing . - ( FR ) The two reports put to the vote today - one on the common foreign policy and the other on the security and defence policy - have one thing in common : they take the Member States ' foreign and defence policies away from them to the advantage of the civil servants in Brussels .
Diplomacy will be in the hands of a High Representative , a real foreign affairs minister .
In addition , since it is shared , there will be a single defence , under the patronage this time of the United States , via NATO and the UN , as clearly indicated in take two of the European Constitution , the Lisbon Treaty .
Our military resources are reduced to their simplest expression because the bulk of the budgets is today spent by France and the United Kingdom and subject to the Stability Pact .
The French and British permanent seats on the UN Security Council will no doubt be combined into one and handed over to an all-powerful European ...
In short , none of the EU Member States will have the political and military resources to ensure their own independence and freedom .
In any case , for the most part they have already handed these over to the Eurocrats .
We are completely opposed to this disastrous development .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , I supported the resolution on the EU-United States summit because in addition to matters pertaining to bilateral partnership and global challenges it refers to the visa question , which is an issue of great importance to Polish nationals .
Polish nationals wishing to visit the United States as tourists still have to go through the complicated and costly procedure of obtaining a visa .
Approximately 25 % of visa applications by Poles are rejected .
The main , and sometimes the only , reason for rejection is the consular officials ' suspicion that the applicant might be intending to undertake illegal work .
In fact , most Poles travel to the United States to visit relations .
Some three quarters of the 10 million Poles resident in the United States hail from the Lesser Poland region of my country , which explains why there are such long queues in front of the American consulate in Krakow .
I believe that the very existence of such a procedure in relation to a European Union Member State requires the Union to adopt a strong stance in the dialogue with the United States .
in writing . - I wish to raise the issue in the context of this debate of US Missile Defence plans , particularly in respect to the Czech Republic .
Two thirds of the Czech population are opposed to the building of a radar installation close to Prague as part of these plans .
Two Czech peace activists have been on hunger strike for three weeks in protest at the Czech Government 's obstinate support for these plans , despite little evidence that they will do other than make Europe 's security worse rather than better .
I welcome the fact that these two are now being joined by key political figures each fasting for 24 hours .
I agree with them that the EU needs to reach a common position on the installation of these Star War technologies in Europe .
We need an urgent debate in this Chamber with the Council .
I hope the President will push for this next month .
Junilistan sympathises wholeheartedly with those parts of the Resolution which deal with the treatment of American prisoners and their transportation through European countries .
The United States must either bring the captives before a court or release them , in accordance with international law .
The conditions prevailing at Guantanamo and other prisons are totally unacceptable .
Unfortunately the report deals with far too many matters going beyond this problem , questions for which other international bodies , in particular the United Nations , are competent .
We do not think that the European Parliament has a role to play as regards the political situation in countries which are not in the immediate vicinity of the EU , such as Iran , Kosovo or Iraq .
The European Parliament should also not attempt to expand European foreign policy by calling on other countries to develop cooperation and common strategies on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction .
These are highly charged questions which are best dealt with from the perspectives of the Member States themselves and in cooperation with legitimate international organisations competent for these matters .
Junilistan also has strong criticism for that part of the resolution which seeks to allocate large parts of the EU and United States budgets to the sponsorship of agricultural research .
in writing . - British Labour MEPs are delighted to have voted in favour of this resolution in advance of the EU-US summit on the 10th of June .
We hope that this resolution will aid in making this Summit a productive one .
In particular Labour MEPs welcome the call made for the EU and US to work closely together on a wide range of common policy challenges ; the call for the EU and US to place the Millennium Development Goals at the heart of international development policy is also one which Labour MEPs wholeheartedly support .
British Labour MEPs voted to abstain on amendment 8 , as we believe that this text does not offer a balanced approach to this issue .
We believe that discussions must also focus on Russia 's obligations , and include wider international disarmament efforts , as explicitly recommended in the successful Socialist Group amendment to the European Security and Defence Policy report , also voted today .
in writing . - The upcoming US presidential election is an opportunity to move away from the type of foreign policy practised under the Bush administration .
Such a change should involve Europe and the EU should be looking to strengthen the EU-US partnership , especially when addressing global challenges such as climate change and poverty .
I support Mr Wiersma 's motion for a resolution .
We , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) , are voting against the joint resolution for the following reasons :
• it calls for the imperialist cooperation between the United States and the EU to be strengthened by boosting NATO in order to manipulate and exploit peoples and states ;
• it confirms the strategic anti-popular EU-US alliance against ' terrorism ' .
However many hypocritical appeals are made to respect human rights , the alliance is nothing more than a pretext for jointly waging a relentless war against the people ;
• the resolution uses the excuse of the effects of climate change on countries and peoples to prepare the way for new imperialist interventions in league with the United States ;
• through its policy of treating all sides equally , the resolution in fact supports the occupying Israeli forces and their crimes at the expense of the Palestinian people .
It accepts the continued occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan and suggests practical cooperation measures between the United States and the EU in the Euro-NATO protectorate of Kosovo .
The resolution is yet more proof of the irreversible strategic agreement between the EU and the United States at the expense of the people .
The resolution flaunts political might to show that the EU is supposedly a rival of the United States , which it feels inferior to .
in writing . - ( PT ) One of the most surprising facts of European policy is the way in which relations between Europe and the United States are treated , particularly when compared to the methods used to present our relations with other partners who are more politically and culturally different .
It is clear that there are differences of opinion , disagreements , competition and interests , particularly legitimate economic interests , which put us in different places and positions .
However , it is essential that we have control over the tensions and divergences between partners in the same project .
It is important to recognise this so that we can act and react to whatever we are facing .
In this respect , properly removing the barriers to trade which are unnecessary and unjustifiable between partners such as Europe and the US is one of the first steps to be taken .
Likewise , if we truly want to respond to the threatened rise in poverty , which is an unnecessary result of increased global demand , it is important that we cooperate among ourselves and in particular with the rest of the world , to ensure that struggling countries can achieve the commercial openness needed to build their own wealth .
A more prosperous world can be constructed on the basis of a solid alliance between free societies which stimulate creation .
in writing . - British Conservatives are strong supporters of the Transatlantic Relationship ; however , we do not agree on redefining this as a relationship between the EU and the US , particularly in defence matters , and we therefore reject much of paragraph 16 .
in writing . - ( PT ) While clearly revealing its inter-imperialist contradictions , this resolution reaffirms the cooperation between the EU and the US and the aim of reinforcing their partnership - particularly in light of the forthcoming US presidential election - in sharing ' responsibility ' in the world .
The resolution reaffirms the EU as a European pillar of NATO , as indicated in the ' European Security Strategy ' , and urges the EU and the US to ' work more closely together on a wide range of common policy challenges , notably in the Middle East , Iran , Iraq , Kosovo and the Western Balkans , Afghanistan and Africa ' .
Looking forward to 60 years of NATO , the resolution calls for the launch of ' a redefined and stronger EU-NATO partnership ' and points to the adjustment of the ' European Security Strategy ' to the new strategic concept of NATO under discussion .
In line with the militarism of the Treaty ' of Lisbon ' , it looks forward ' to a reassessment of the security dimension of EU-US relations in the light of the outcome of the NATO Strategic Review , the update of the European Security Strategy and the arrival in office of a new US Administration ' .
In other words , it establishes and affirms the EU as a political-economic-military bloc which hopes to share control of the world ( by seeking to rebalance its relations ) with the US .
The world and the people who are looked after ...
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by five political groups on the Union for the Mediterranean .
The Mediterranean region and the Middle East are of strategic importance for the Union and it is essential to implement a Mediterranean policy founded on solidarity , dialogue , cooperation and trade in order to tackle the common challenges and achieve the declared objective , namely the creation of an area of peace , stability and shared prosperity .
I welcome the initiative of the President of the French Republic , Nicolas Sarkozy , to whom this Union for the Mediterranean owes a great deal , and I wish him every success with the inaugural summit , due to be held in Paris on 13 July .
I support the political proposal to give this future Union a parliamentary dimension on the basis of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly .
I welcome the examples of proposed initiatives such as the coastal motorways , the linking-up of the Arab Maghreb Motorway ( AMA ) , the de-pollution of the Mediterranean , civil protection , the Mediterranean Solar Plan , high-power solar thermal electricity generation in the North African desert , the desalination of seawater in order to facilitate access to drinking water , etc .
in writing . - ( FR ) I welcome the adoption of the joint resolution on the ' Barcelona Process : Union for the Mediterranean ' .
This resolution rightly highlights the strategic interest of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East for the European Union .
Our policy towards these countries must be based on the principles of solidarity , dialogue and cooperation .
The Barcelona Process warrants being re-launched today in order to make it as efficient as possible .
To this end , the Commission 's initiative is a step in the right direction and has the merit of concentrating on specific regional projects , which will make it possible to provide an effective response to the needs of the citizens of this region .
The Commission proposal also recommends the establishment of a Barcelona Process co-presidency , a Joint Permanent Committee and a secretariat , which will help to improve cooperation and dialogue between the various partners .
In addition , it states that the main objectives of this policy must continue to be promotion of the rule of law , democracy , respect for human rights and political pluralism .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is not done with disowning hyper-President Sarkozy : rejection of the proposals on fuel tax , warnings against the budgetary slides and , now , transformation of the proposed Union for the Mediterranean into a re-launch of the Barcelona Process , which has been a failure for more than 10 years .
This is the death of the project concerning cooperation between the countries bordering the mare nostrum , led by France .
From now on the entire Union will be involved and it is the Commission in Brussels that will be at the controls .
That is what was decided by the real boss : Mrs Merkel 's Germany .
This matter perfectly illustrates two realities : Mr Sarkozy 's agitation and media hype only serve to mask his powerlessness ; France 's interests are in the hands of the officials in Brussels and dependent upon those of the European Union .
We sincerely hope that Ireland , a nation that has such a great love of freedom and that has paid dearly for it in the course of its history , will be the country that delivers us from this Eurocratic construction that is increasingly unfounded and increasingly tyrannical .
in writing . - ( PT ) If you only read the resolution adopted today , you would tend to believe in the most genuine and benevolent intentions of the EU with regard to the ' Union for the Mediterranean ' .
Its careful language reveals only a few hints of interference and the omnipresent objectives of the ' establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area ' and ' free trade ' , accompanied , of course , by ' social ' and ' environmental ' palliatives and rhetoric .
However , the European Commission makes it clear that ' the Mediterranean region is an area of vital strategic importance to the European Union in both political and economic terms ' .
It talks about the ' significant progress [ that ] has been made towards the establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free-trade area by 2010 ' , pointing to the need for the EU 's Mediterranean partners to pursue ' further and faster reforms ' .
The Commission puts forward a series of priorities such as transport ( pointing to the possibility of setting up a concession scheme of interest to the private sector and accompanied by governmental measures to ensure free trade and abolish the various non-tariff obstacles preventing trade ) and increasing the integration of the energy markets .
The EU wants to economically , politically and militarily control the whole Mediterranean region and is seeking to dominate its markets and exploit its immense resources .
That is capitalism , you fool !
in writing . - ( FR ) The very title of the resolution underlines Mr Sarkozy 's failure .
Not content with being the President of the French Republic , he was trying to become the designer , then the president , of a Euro-Mediterranean Union , open only to the countries bordering the Mediterranean .
Even before his European presidency begins , his house of cards is collapsing .
Germany has imposed its positions : all the EU Member States will participate in this project , designed to be a simple expansion of the Barcelona Process , managed by the Eurocrats in Brussels .
This fiasco illustrates the debasement of our country in the European institutions .
The Europe of Brussels , far from strengthening France , as the UMP and PS claim , is making it weaker in all sectors : in the economic sector , with the destruction of our small farms , the collapse and relocation of our industries ; in the military sector , with the dismantlement of our army , now required to dissolve into a Euro corps ; in the demographic sector , with immigration that is threatening our national identity .
Only a new Europe , a Europe of nation states , founded on the sovereignty of the nations and on the founding values of our European and Christian civilisation , will enable France to become a major player once again and implement in the Mediterranean a major cooperation policy aimed , inter alia , at ensuring that the immigrant populations return to their home countries .
For some time now the European Union has been working to develop special cooperative relations with the countries on the African and Asian shores of the Mediterranean Sea .
This cooperation constantly raises the question of whether it means that we support the dictatorship in Syria or that we approve of the way in which Israel is delaying the creation of an equal and internationally recognised Palestinian State .
The idea of the French President , Mr Sarkozy , for a special union between the EU and all the countries of the Mediterranean , calls especially for support among the public of the EU Member States that border the Mediterranean Sea .
The establishment of such a union could contribute to the EU building up spheres of influence in the region with unequal partners , following the example of the traditional agreements between the US and parts of Latin America .
It could also serve to legitimise the dictatorships in Tunisia , Libya and Syria , and to a lesser extent Algeria and Egypt .
It would make it easier to send refugees back to such states .
It would also give us the chance to upgrade contacts with Israel now , instead of waiting until after the recognition of a neighbouring Palestinian State .
It is only because of these underlying problems that I am not voting for this resolution now .
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece ( KKE ) have voted against the joint resolution .
The Union for the Mediterranean does not in the final analysis have equal , mutually profitable relations with the states of the region .
Instead , it supports the EU 's imperialist plans for the wider region of the Mediterranean and the Middle East .
The aim of this Union is to liberalise markets in order to enable them to be more easily accessed by European monopolies , whose position in the monopolistic fight for control of the markets will be improved .
The energy and wealth-producing resources of the region will be plundered .
The Union for the Mediterranean will be achieved by intensifying threats , blackmail , and political or even military pressure on states and the people .
The resolution is also revealing .
The primary objective of the Union for the Mediterranean policy is purportedly for democracy and human rights to be exported from the EU to the Mediterranean countries .
This is the pretext the EU uses to justify its imperialist interventions everywhere .
In fact , what is being promoted is the imperialist US-NATO-ΕU plan for the ' New Middle East ' .
That is why there is no reference to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories or to the genocide of the Palestinian people .
The people should have no illusions about the nature and aims of the Union for the Mediterranean ; they should fight against it .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mr President , the percentage of young farmers in the European Union continues to fall .
Currently , only 7 % of farmers are under the age of 35 .
In many cases , young people leave farming because of the high cost of investment , which means that it is impossible for them to compete on the market .
We should therefore help young farmers to draw on Union funding for this purpose .
Young farmers would benefit from low-interest loans enabling them to implement their plans without running the risk of becoming heavily indebted .
In addition , care should be taken to ensure that the criteria for accessing Union funding are not too demanding and do not exclude small farms focusing on specialised products rather than on large-scale production .
The majority of the farms in southern Poland and in the Lesser Poland and Swietokrzyskie Voivodships fit this description .
Mr Veraldi 's report deals with all these matters and I therefore voted in favour of it .
in writing . - ( FR ) In the light of the difficulty in finding new generations of European farmers , the European Parliament decided to look at the ways to promote the installation of young farmers , which should guide the CAP Health Check .
As the shadow rapporteur of the PSE Group , I put forward the following proposals :
it is a priority to respond to the food , energy , environmental and territorial challenges ,
the new farmers must benefit from support measures , especially those who do not inherit a farm and those who are based in areas with permanent natural handicaps : higher installation aid , subsidies for agricultural loans and accompanying measures following installation ,
these support measures must be compulsory under the second pillar of the CAP and the aspect of access to agricultural property must be examined ,
living conditions in rural areas must be improved : equal access to public services , social amenities , etc . ,
we must develop access to vocational training ( replacement during training and access to agricultural research ) ,
we must promote the farming profession and the standards respected by farmers at European level .
The EU should not concern itself with everything .
The principle of a leaner but keener EU implies that the EU should only deal with questions for which there is authority in the founding Treaty and , where demarcation problems arise , proportionality , effectiveness and relevance should be taken into account .
I have chosen to abstain in the final vote on the report on the future for young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy .
The report contains many proposals which improve the situation for newly established young operators as well as proposals which can contribute to the increased production of food .
But at the same time the text also covers matters which are quite definitely of national significance and should be decided at national level .
in writing . - ( PT ) Many of the proposals contained in the report , to which we have suggested a few amendments , are on the right lines , particularly those referring to the ' continuing difficulties ' facing young farmers , such as high installation costs , a heavy burden of debt and too few available holdings .
We have made various proposals to which we would draw the European Commission 's attention for the future , in particular :
the need to adopt the necessary measures to support , accompany and advise young farmers under the initial setting-up scheme with the aim of increasing the success rate and at the same time minimising or putting an end to situations where farmers give up or even become bankrupt ;
the creation of a land bank on the basis of land freed up as a result of early retirement ;
the need to introduce support for the joint acquisition of expensive machinery and equipment which is used infrequently by each individual farmer .
However , we regard as inadequate those measures adopted to tackle the existing problems which make Portugal the EU Member State with the lowest percentage of young farmers ( less than 4 % ) .
It is essential that , within the current review of the common agricultural policy , productive activity is duly valued , with fair prices for production .
in writing . - ( PT ) In recent decades , European rural areas have been increasingly abandoned , a trend which has been accompanied by a gradual ageing of the population .
This ageing of the agricultural population is worrying for the future of European agriculture .
That is why I consider the Veraldi report to be very important as it looks at various aspects connected with the expectations and opportunities of young farmers who have a key role to play in the sustainable development of European rural areas .
I believe that young farmers are particularly important to the development of a dynamic agricultural sector in order to achieve the Lisbon Strategy objectives .
Under the new common agricultural policy , the generational change must therefore be regarded as one of the priorities .
in writing . - ( PL ) We should welcome the fact that by a large majority , the House has adopted the report on the future of young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy .
The statements on increasing European Union aid for young farmers are particularly significant .
One of these statements is a declaration concerning easier access to preferential loans for this group of farmers .
Further practical aid is essential in terms of creating real opportunities for young farmers wishing to continue the family tradition in the Lesser Poland Voivodship to obtain a reasonable income .
If the promised aid has the desired effect , the situation whereby villages in Lesser Poland are inhabited solely by older people caring for their grandchildren whose parents feel that the only opportunity open to them is to seek work abroad may become less common .
This report therefore has a social dimension as well as an economic one .
Young farmers wish to preserve traditions , but they also understand that if they do not draw on other experiences and technology they will be unable to transform their family farms into modern , competitive and profitable enterprises .
Support for the development of modern methods and agricultural production tools is therefore a particularly important feature of the resolution adopted today .
As usual , we in Junilistan note that in this case it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision on the EU 's agricultural policy because , if it had , the Union would be caught in a trap of protectionism and heavy subsidies to various groups in the farming industry .
This own-initiative report contains a number of absurd proposals , such as yet another ' European Year ' , this time for ' urban-rural dialogue ' .
If every European Year proposed by the European Parliament were to become a reality , every year from now to the end of the century would probably be booked up in advance .
The affirmation in paragraph 35 that rural development measures should be aimed directly at farmers strengthens Junilistan 's impression that the old , overburdened ' common agricultural policy ' has now merely changed its name to ' rural development ' in the EU budget .
It is with disquiet that we note that the European Parliament now calls for the recognition of non-trade concerns as import criteria in the WTO context .
We consider that to be nothing more than a preliminary to the introduction of barriers to trade and protectionism against the rest of the world .
I have therefore chosen to vote against the report .
in writing . - The Veraldi report on the future of young farmers highlights a number of important issues which are of relevance across the EU 's rural areas .
The report also recognises that farming methods rooted in specific geographical areas and cultural traditions in Europe should be conserved , improved and promoted .
I wholeheartedly endorse those sentiments and consider that they can be applied across the EU 's workload .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted in favour of this report , as I consider that the measures stipulated therein are complementary to the national programmes in this field .
The National Programme for Rural Development of Romania provides a measure that offers grants from the rural development funds of the European Union of up to EURO 40.000 per person .
Yet , there are difficult conditions to be fulfilled and , consequently , we still have a small number of requests in this regard .
The report we are adopting today provides for a series of significant measures , both in terms of the financial support of young farmers , and in terms of certain essential legal aspects , like the facilitation of succession upon agricultural property or easy access to bank credits .
The professional education and training component offered to young people in rural areas is also important .
Thus , I consider that future legislation should provide for the huge disproportion between the younger population aged 35 , active in the agricultural sector ( only 8,5 % of the total number of farmers in Europe ) and the other age categories in this field .
These measures will definitely contribute to the success of the national programmes , as is the major axis of supporting the young farmers , stipulated by PNDR of Romania .
in writing.- ( DE ) What questions do young people nowadays ask themselves when deciding on a career ?
Do they ask about the nature of the occupation , the prospects it offers for the future , or making a fast buck ?
The answer to all these questions is often negative when farming is one of the options .
Only 7 % of farmers are under the age of 35 , with the result that this occupation is an alarming state of decline .
There are many young people who would enjoy farming : working in the open air and close to nature , surrounded by plants and animals . That is a given .
So what deters young people ? Is it the lack of prospects , or the general insecurity surrounding the profession ?
Once , inheriting the family farm provided a very good and very secure living , but today , the heirs are often at a disadvantage due to the many burdens and conditions imposed on them .
We know that only well-trained and highly motivated farmers can guarantee our high standards of healthy food and a healthy natural environment here in Europe .
However , we must also be aware of the challenges facing young farmers today .
We must involve young farmers in political discussions and decision-making to a greater extent .
They are the bearers of Europe 's hopes !
They are the ones who are facing up to the numerous economic and ecological challenges and ensuring a good and well-balanced social environment in the rural regions .
They therefore need reliable policies to support them .
in writing . - ( FR ) I welcome the adoption of this report , which highlights the fundamental challenge generation change in the agricultural sector poses for the European Union .
Young farmers are those who are best placed to respond to the new agricultural challenges .
Having benefited from the experience of their elders , they have the necessary dynamism and enthusiasm to carry out the crucial environmental , technological and economic changes that will enable tomorrow 's European agriculture to retain a prime position in the world .
We now need to reconcile an increasing level of agricultural production with constant respect for product quality and safety , within the framework of a global approach based on the preservation of natural resources and the environment .
However , these requirements mean ever-increasing financial and personal investments from young farmers .
In addition , the acquisition of adapted physical and intellectual tools must receive greater support from the Union , as stated in the report , especially in the area of access to technological innovations .
The CAP cannot afford to neglect those who will ensure that the Community has sustainable food sovereignty that respects man and the environment .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Veraldi because I fully support the initiatives aimed at ensuring the future of sustainable , competitive and productive agriculture in the EU .
It is essential to encourage and facilitate young people 's access to the agri-food sector in order to promote generation change and ensure the dynamism of the sector .
In order to enable young farmers to cope with the numerous challenges and expectations , such as the production of quality food , food safety , environmental protection , and preservation of biodiversity and the countryside , it is crucial to review the amount of the setting-up premium , which has not changed for years .
In addition , we need to ensure that this premium is accompanied by a business plan so as not to curb the innovative spirit of young farmers .
Nonetheless , we must also be aware that middle-aged farmers are facing the same challenges .
It is important to ensure that we do not place them at a disadvantage or harm their existing operating methods .
in writing . - Encouraging young people into the farming sector is essential to guarantee the future of the farming industry .
Support should be given to newcomers in the farming sector including young farmers .
I support the general direction of the Veraldi report on the future for young farmers under the ongoing reform of the CAP and voted accordingly .
in writing . - Statistics show that rural populations across Europe are simultaneously decreasing and ageing .
Moreover , the percentage of farms currently managed by young people is extremely low .
This is a worrying trend which is affecting all Member States .
Young people are not considering farming as a career option because , in many cases , issues such as the succession of farms and difficulties associated with obtaining credit simply outweigh the benefits of starting out .
This insightful report addresses the most important issues which are deterring young people from entering into farming and suggests some practical solutions for dealing with these problems .
After all , if we wish to secure the stability and development of Europe 's agriculture sector , we must provide young people with incentives to enter into farming and remove the obstacles which they face .
The report also recognises that , like any other modern industry , farming needs to be competitive , efficient and able to respond and adapt to market demands .
We need to take measures which support and encourage young people in this context , as the next generation of farmers are the key to a dynamic and innovative European agriculture sector .
in writing . - ( SK ) Slovakia , just like other new EU Member States , has a high proportion of rural areas .
Rural areas comprise almost 80 % of the country 's total area , and according to the statistics this is where more than 44 % of people live .
The present situation in the food industry , high food prices and the production of quality food are the major challenges for European rural areas .
It is good to see that young farmers in particular are interested in the ecological farming system .
It gives some guarantee of the growing importance of farming aimed at promoting rural development .
Entrepreneurial spirit in farming has its typical features and carries far greater risks than entrepreneurial spirit in other economic sectors .
Many young people think that setting up a farming business is impossible because of the high costs .
Introducing various incentives can help young farmers either to set up in business or ( later ) modernise their enterprises .
I voted for the report by the rapporteur , Mr Donato Tommaso Veraldi , on the future for young farmers under the ongoing reform of the common agricultural policy , because I am convinced that by supporting young farmers we can significantly help to improve the employment rate in peripheral European regions and prevent young people from leaving rural areas .
in writing . - I will vote in favour of this report but I must highlight that Amendment 35 is unacceptable to me and I and the British Labour delegation will vote against this particular amendment .
Sustainable rural development is the key to maintaining our countryside and the traditional way of life enjoyed by our rural communities .
Indeed , on the issue of modulation , Members may recall that it was only British Labour MEPs who supported concerted efforts to change our priorities away from direct payments and into sustainable rural development .
Farmers have a key role to play in delivering rural sustainability and development , but they are not the only people involved in that delivery , which is why I cannot support Amendment 35 .
This Parliament has developed a habit of constantly demanding direct payments to farmers and no doubt it will do the same when we discuss the CAP Health Check in the near future .
I think those of us who believe that things need to change in this regard , away from a system that rewards inefficiency at the expense of efficient agriculture , are those who truly believe in sustainable rural development .
The ageing of the agricultural population , the abandonment of cultivated land and the constant reduction in the number of young people working in farming are recent developments that have occurred during the past 20 years .
Throughout these years the EU has failed to tackle the problems faced by small and medium-sized farmers , particularly young people .
The EU 's measures are part of its anti-agricultural policy , which aims to reduce production and concentrate land in the hands of a few large-scale farmers .
This will result in the shrinkage of the agricultural population and the abandonment of the countryside , particularly by young people .
The report limits itself to findings .
The measures it puts forward are within the framework of this policy , so they hide the real reason behind the problems : the EU 's confrontational policy .
This policy , together with the anti-farming CAP , aims to promote and increase the profits of the multinational monopolies and attack the incomes of small and medium-sized farmers .
The report actively supports the partial review carried out on the CAP in 2003 , the proposed CAP ' health check ' measures and the inclusion of the agricultural economy within the framework of the EU 's anti-popular Lisbon Strategy .
Overturning the EU 's anti-agricultural , anti-popular policy is the only solution that will enable farmers to remain on their land .
It will guarantee a decent income rather than further the aims and interests of the multinational monopolies .
in writing . - ( PL ) As a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly I should like to congratulate Mr Hutchinson on his report , which I fully support .
The workings of this Assembly , and in particular the opportunities it provides for direct contact between parliamentarians on both sides , do much to make the Union 's presence felt in the most distant regions of Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific .
The Assembly does not focus exclusively on a rigid plan of action .
It is also capable of reacting swiftly to crisis situations and to events as they unfold .
After all , the Assembly adopts resolutions and makes decisions , all of which result in mobilising material and financial Union aid .
Such aid is very much needed and eagerly awaited , especially in regions affected by natural disasters .
I should like to say how pleased I am with the organisational arrangements .
Meeting alternately in Europe and in countries of the ACP region in turn allows members of the Assembly to familiarise themselves with the situation on the ground and understand it better .
I also support the arrangements for workshops and fact-finding and research missions associated with the Assembly .
In particular , I should like to express my strong support for the idea of a forum for women as an opportunity for discussion and exchange of good practice regarding equal treatment of men and women .
I believe that if the European Parliament wishes the ACP countries to perceive it as an institution promoting democracy , it cannot turn a blind eye to the injustices so often experienced by women in those regions .
in writing . - ( PT ) While welcoming the involvement and participation of national parliaments and parliamentarians in the negotiations on the EU 's Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) with the African , Caribbean and Pacific ( ACP ) countries , we consider that the political position adopted with regard to these EPAs must not be restricted to the ' process ' , with no mention being made of their contents .
If this approach were taken , it would represent a devious attempt to draw attention away from the fundamental issue , which is that the proposed EPAs aim to establish neo-colonial relations by setting up free trade agreements .
Through these agreements , the EU , the major powers and their main financial and economic groups will force these countries to open up their markets and will be able to sell their goods and services , exploit the raw materials of these countries and impose an export-oriented production model , thus removing the sovereignty of these countries and making their development dependent on the interests of the EU .
This is in the DNA of capitalism ...
In terms of reaping what we sow , our capitalist intentions will lead , for the vast majority of humanity , to price increases , unemployment , poverty , hunger and so on .
As a result , we need to say no to the EPAs and to neo-colonialism .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Hutchinson report .
The work that this Parliament has done over the decades together with the ACP countries is something that we as an institution can regard with some satisfaction .
in writing . - ( FI ) I have been a member of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly since my first term of office .
Mr Hutchinson 's report on the work of the Assembly in 2007 is , I believe , a comprehensive account of both the progress made over the last year and the challenges that we have faced .
I think that the fact that the standing committees will now also be responsible for following up resolutions is definitely a move in the right direction .
It has provided an opportunity for far more in-depth dialogue than was previously available to them in the more formal follow-up that took place in plenary .
Furthermore , the Assembly has had a key role in monitoring negotiations on Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) : interaction between parliamentarians has fostered the transparency of the process and made it easier to take grass-roots issues into account .
It is because of the very nature of the work that the Parliamentary Assembly has , to my mind , become an important actor in EU development cooperation .
Strengthening the parliamentary dimension and close cooperation in the follow-up process will do more and more to enable EU funds to be channelled directly to serve the needs of the people and , for example , to achieve the Millennium Development Goals on health and education .
in writing . - I welcome Alain Hutchinson 's report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2007 .
Greater involvement of parliaments and civil society can improve and help intensify the ACP-EU relationship .
It is through such cooperation that we can improve the quality of development assistance and its targeting .
I therefore voted in favour of the report 's recommendations .
in writing . - ( GA ) I was very happy to support Mr Hutchinson 's report last year on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly ( JPA ) .
I would like to refer to some aspects of this report that really impressed me .
It is fortunate that the rapporteur referred to the Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPA ) .
The European Union needs to keep a close watch on EPA talks and developments and the JPA has done this .
As has been stated by the rapporteur , the JPAs have a central role in monitoring talks and creating links between the two sides : the EU and countries of the South .
I would also like to praise the rapporteur for the reference he made to Somalia as ' a crisis that has been forgotten ' .
Somalia is not alone , however , and we in the EU and the ACP are obliged to support , help and direct attention on these regions .
Above all else , however , this reports highlights the good work that has been done by the JPA , work that is sometimes not respected enough .
in writing . ? ( PL ) The rapporteur rightly draws attention to the need to establish an appropriate framework for an open , democratic and content-based dialogue aimed at negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements between Member States of the European Union and ACP countries .
A further important aspect is increased participation of the national parliaments and societies of individual countries in order to strengthen ACP-EU cooperation .
Particular importance should also be ascribed to regional cooperation and integration .
Actions aimed at strengthening peace should receive strong support too , especially in those ACP countries where the political situation remains unstable .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of the report on the activities of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
I believe it is a good idea for the standing committee of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly to follow up resolutions by meeting with Commission officials responsible for the relevant areas .
To date this follow-up has only taken place in plenary sessions .
The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly has many tasks before it , all of which aim to promote the economic development of the ACP countries .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am voting in favour of this report , which makes another significant contribution to Europe 's economic development .
I therefore welcome the excellent work done by Mr Pittella , who has clearly spelled out the proposals and principles which should regulate this very important sector .
Harmonisation of the credit market constitutes another step towards an extremely important goal : the completion of a truly integrated internal market which attempts to overcome the existing legislative differences between Member States .
Financial services are of general economic interest , in that they play a key role both in terms of economic development and in terms of properly implementing the Schengen objectives .
I am thinking of citizens who have huge difficulties in obtaining accurate information , and of the exit penalties - often in the form of high abandonment costs - which confront users wishing to switch from one credit institution to another .
in writing . - ( PT ) While there are certain positive aspects to the report adopted today , namely information on , and facilitation of , certain banking procedures for consumers , access to these services still lies within the context of a liberalised financial market where the aim , by nature , is to pursue maximum profits and not to protect consumers .
That is why we abstained from voting .
It is not enough to guarantee the right to a bank account .
We must ensure that fees or any other types of penalty are not charged to customers for any services , particularly where the people hardest hit would be those who are financially weak , those with accounts with limited funds and transactions or simply those who hold bank accounts .
It is essential to guarantee the public service which also exists in the financial sector , without which we will worsen social inequalities , dramatically affecting those people with fewer financial resources , social solidarity institutions and other social organisations , including small and micro-enterprises .
in writing . - The Pittella report , which I supported , highlights the importance of culture , habits and languages in consumer choices and protection for financial products .
The diverse cultures , habits and languages of the EU deserve respect in all areas of the Union 's work and are essential if the European Institutions ' work is to gain public support .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the work done by the committee responsible and the rapporteur , Mr Karas , has taken our parliamentary debate a stage further and is helpful in clarifying what problems need to be tackled and resolved in this field .
Furthermore , I am pleased that particular emphasis is at last being given to small operators and not just to large movements of capital .
The financial services sector does not just serve large companies operating at European or intercontinental level ; it is likewise a vital tool for anyone wishing to take new ideas and ways of doing business beyond their own local market .
High-level legislative action by the European Union will undoubtedly lead to greater competition and lower costs for consumers , with a positive impact on increased choice and wider access to such services by users .
Given the importance of this sector and the advantages which would stem from better legislation in this field , I am happy to see that , thanks to this report , Parliament will finally be able to put forward appropriate measures of direct benefit to consumers .
in writing . - ( PT ) The liberalisation of retail financial services in the single market is the most recent proposal from the European Commission following on from the liberalisations set out in the Lisbon Strategy .
The aim is to take another step towards achieving full liberalisation of services in the European Union .
As a result , and following on from other initiatives , the liberalisation of various retail financial services is now proposed , in particular banking products , insurance and pensions .
The aim is to remove anything which might be regarded as an ' obstacle ' , using the old arguments of lower prices and greater choice for consumers , when experience actually shows precisely the opposite .
It is the large companies which gradually increase their profits at the cost of more expensive services for consumers .
Although we are pleased at the adoption of the amendment tabled by our Group , given that a particular duty of care needs to apply to the marketing of savings and old-age pension products as the decisions that consumers take in that regard are normally decisions of great importance to them and generally taken only once in a life , the fact is that most of the report is negative .
That is why we voted against it .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as the rapporteur quite rightly points out , for there to be a market , there must be supply and demand .
That does not seem to be the case for a cross-border retail financial services market , however .
The report is in fact based on the premise that allowing the supply is bound to encourage the demand .
Even though we all might like to benefit from cheaper credit or more profitable investments , it is unlikely that tomorrow an Italian will go to a Danish or Cypriot bank to get a loan to buy his house or his car .
We all know why : linguistic problems , justified apprehension about the risks , uncertainty about the tax arrangements , etc .
The rapporteur , who highlights the importance of the aspects of trust , proximity and personal relations for the consumer , is under no illusions .
This desire to artificially create such a market does not manage to conceal one of the main aims of the manoeuvre : forcing the states to harmonise their taxes and regulations so as to be prepared for all contingencies or imposing a 28th legal order , a supranational order , accompanied , for good measure , by the adoption of the euro by the countries that rejected it , thereby enabling them to participate fully in this hypothetical market .
We cannot support these proposals .
in writing . - I voted in favour of the Karas report on retail financial services in the single market .
My own country , Scotland , is home to a number of world class financial companies and they can benefit from access across the internal market .
Nevertheless , respect must be had for the different financial cultures and traditions of the EU 's nations and I believe that the Karas report strikes the right balance in recognising the need for subsidiarity in this area .
in writing . - ( RO ) I voted for the Report " The Green Card for the retail financial services on the single market ” , because the access of the consumers to the retail trans-border financial services represents an important factor of the reinforcement of the single market , under the conditions of insuring a high degree of protection to consumers .
With united efforts on a national and European level , it is necessary to develop consumer awareness campaigns regarding trans-b
