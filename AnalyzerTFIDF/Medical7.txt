Abstract--Two transplantable rat central nervous system (CNS) tumors
induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) were employed to study the mechanisms
controlling extracranial metastasis from intracranial tumors. Cells derived from a
serially passaged anaplastic astrocytoma and a malignant glioma were injected
intracerebrally at doses of 104, l0 s and 106 cells per rat (Sprague-Dawley and
WAG/R O rats). As soon as neurological dysfunction appeared, animals were sacrificed
and examined histologically for (1) extracerebral outgrowth of the intracerebral tumor,
(2) the presence of distant metastases within the CNS and (3) remote metastases
outside the CNS. In addition to histology, a bioassay procedure was performed.
Metastases were found in cervical lymph nodes (74%), lung (21%) and liver (5°,/o).
For both tumor groups, rats with both distant CNS metastases and local extracerebral
outgrowth developed remote metastases more frequently (P <0.05) than animals with
intracerebral growth only. The data indicate that both local extracranial spread due to
surgical intervention as well as local and distant invasion of leptomeninges promote
extracranial metastatic spread.
INTRODUCTION
THE APPEARANCE of a remote metastasis from
a primar¥ CNS tumor is a rare but recognized
phenomenon in man. To date more than 200
of such cases have .been reported in the literature
[1--4]. When metastasis does occur, it is
generally related to prior surgical intervention
or to tumor growth into the leptomeninges.
The rarity of extracranial metastasis from
brain tumors has been ascribed to immunological
properties and the absence of lymphatics
in the brain, the biological characteristics
of malignant glioma cells, the bloodbrain
barrier and quantitative factors related
to short survival of the patient due to the
limited space within the cranial cavity [5-7].
To our knowledge, no experimental studies
have been performed to test these hypotheses.
In general, chemically induced brain tumors
do not metastasize from their intracranial
site of origin even though dissemination

has been observed following subcutaneous
transplantation [8, 9]. In this study ENUinduced
primary brain tumors were transplanted
into the cerebral tissue of syngeneic rats in
order to study metastasis from the brain. The
rat was chosen as an experimental model
since several transplantable CNS tumors from
a previous study [9] were available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Partially inbred Sprague-Dawley (SD) and
inbred WAG/Rij rats were used. The animals
were housed three to five per cage and were
given tap water and standard laboratory chow
ad libitum. Details on the husbandry conditions
in our colony have been published [10].
Tumors
The methods employed for inducing the
primary CNS tumors have been reported [9].
Briefly, ENU was administered i.rn. at a dose
of 10mg per kg body weight to new-born rats.
When neurological dysfunction appeared, the
