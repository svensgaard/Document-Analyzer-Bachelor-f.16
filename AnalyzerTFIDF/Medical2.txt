Abstract--Microbiological and immunological studies were carried out on 73 acute
leukemia patients in order to establish the relationship between the host immune defense
and the frequency and severity of infections. Pronounced disturbances in the functional
activity of granulocytes, the total complement hemolytic activity and C 3 component of the
complement are found during induction chemotherapy; in this period the infectious
complications are more frequent and severe than at the onset of the disease. No
relationship is established between serum lysozyme levels and resistance to infections.
The elevated immunoglobulins G and M as a possible response to the infectious agents
are considered. It is emphasized that a pronounced immunosuppression as well as the
most frequent infectious complications are found in patients in relapse.
INTRODUCTION
INFECTIONS are the most frequent complication
and the leading cause of death in patients
with acute leukemia. This fact is supported by
observations made by a number of authors
[1-9]. The enhanced risk of infectious complications
may be due both to the basic
neoplastic disease, involving the cellular compartment
of the immune system, and to the
immunosuppressive effect of contemporary intensive
chemotherapy. The close relationship
between the frequency of infections and
granulocytopenia in treated leukemic patients
has already been pointed out [10, 11]. It is
also well known that these patients demonstrate
substantial changes in the phagocytic
and bactericidal activity of granulocytes [12-
16], serum immunoglobulin levels [17-19],
lysozyme [20-25] and some cell-mediated immune
reactions [17, 26-30].
The object of this paper is to present the
relationship between the frequency and severity
of infections and the host defense in
acute leukemia patients. It reflects the results
of current studies of some of the most important
factors of the immune system along with
clinical and laboratory investigations on the
infectious process.

Accepted 17 November 1980.
leukemia patients aged between 16 and 78,
who have undergone regular clinical, microbiological
and immunological investigations
throughout the course of the disease.
Clinical and microbiological investigations
On the day of admission patients were
subjected to a thorough clinical examination.
Microbiological cultures were made of oral
secretions, sputum, urine, material from manifested
infectious loci and hemoculture, the
last in cases of fever. During induction chemotherapy
the analyses were repeated depending
upon the clinical and hematological evolution
of the disease. Routine methods of microbiological
diagnosis were used [31].
Immunological studies
On the day of admission, during induction
chemotherapy and at diagnosis of infectious
complications a close observation was maintained
over the absolute granulocyte count in
the peripheral blood, the phagocytic activity
against Staph. aureus, the ability of granulocytes
to ingest and kill Candida albicans, the
serum immunoglobulin and lysozyme levels,
and the total complement hemolytic activity
and C 3 component of complement.
The phagocytic function of peripheral blood
granulocytes against Staph. aureus was tested
according to the method of Van Furth [32],
with determination of the indices phagocytic
activity (PhA)and phagocytic number (PhN).
The PhA represents the percentage of granulocytes
which have ingested Staph. aureus and
the PhN represents the average number of
617
618 Mila Nedelkova, Svetla Bacalova and Georgieva Bojana
Staph. aureus ingested by one phagocyte. For
the quantitative assessment of the phagocytic
efficiency two other indices were computated,
i.e. phagocytic capacity (PhC) and phagocytic
capacity index (PhCI). The first reflects the
number of microorganisms ingested by the
granulocytes in 1/A peripheral blood, and is
determined by the following formula:
AxBxC
PhC
100 '
where A=number of granulocytes per microliter
blood, B = PhA, and C = PhN, while
Phc of the patient
PhCI
PhC of healthy subjects
represents the ratio of PhC of acute leukemia
patients and that of healthy subjects.
The bactericidal activity of granulocytes against
Candida albicans was assayed by the method of
Lehrer and Cline [14].
The total complement hemolytic activity was determined
according to the method of Kabat
and Mayer [33].
The C 3 component of the complement was assayed
by the single radial immunodiffusion
method of Mancini [34].
Serum lysozyme levels were determined by the
lysoplate method of Osserman and Lawlor
[35].
The serum immunoglobulins G, A and M were
determined by the method of Mancini [34].
Statistical analysis.
Computer aided calculation of the numerical
characteristics of the observed factors is
given, based on the analysis of variance.
Authors have developed FORTRAN IV software
of the problem, which can be successfully
applied by other users.
RESULTS
Infectious complications. Frequency, sites and isolated
microorganisms
Of the total of 60 hospitalized patients in
the initial stage of the disease, 35 (58.33%)
were febrile; the febrility in 19 was accompanied
by clinical signs of infection.
Significant pathogens from various infectious
sources were isolated in 24 patients (40%); in
some of them there was more than one infection,
so that the total number of infectious
episodes was 44, or 0.73 infections per patient
(Fig. 1 ). The sites of infections in the various
stages of the disease are tabulated in Table 1.
Severe infections such as sepsis and disseminated
infections (three or more per patient)

are recorded in Table 2.
During induction chemotherapy clinically
manifested and bacteriologically confirmed infections
were noted in 17 of the patients not
infected at admission to hospital; 8 of
initially infected patients developed new sites
of infection. The overall number of infected
patients was 41 (68.33%); the number of
infectious episodes was 95 or 1.52 infections
per patient. The sites of infections and isolated
pathogens remained approximately the same
as in the initial stage of acute leukemia.
Frequency of sepsis and disseminated infection
displayed a marked increase.
Infections were documented in 17 (77.3%)
of the 32 patients hospitalized in relapse, with
a total of 46 infectious episodes, or 2.1 infections
per patient. A further increase in the
frequency of septicemia cases was noted. A
case of Gram negative Pseudomonas meningitis
deserves to be mentioned.

In acute leukemia patients the indices of

the phagocytic process displayed different changes.
Thus, in the initial stage, along with
neutropenia, a certain stimulation of the PhA
as well as of the PhN occurred, while during
induction chemotherapy and the further decrease
of the granulocyte count a substantial
decrease in those indices was observed. On
this ground we assumed the index PhC to be
more informative, since it simultaneously reflects
the changes occurring in the three components
of phagocytosis: the absolute granulocyte
count, the PhA and the PhN. For the
sake of convenience the resulting values are
presented by the PhCI. Thus, in the initial
stage of acute leukemia we found a lower
PhCI in infected patients. During intensive
chemotherapy its values decreased in patients
of both groups. The lowest values were observed
in patients with severe infections and in
relapse.

DISCUSSION
The results demonstrate a dependence between
host defense of acute leukemia patients
and the occurence of infectious complications,
the frequency and severity of which increases
with the aggravation of immunosuppression.
Particularly marked is the participation of
granulocytes in the anti-infectious resistance in
all stages of acute leukemia, where not only
their absolute count, but also their functional
activity is of substantial importance. At the
onset of the disease granulocytopenia does not
seem to be obligatory for all patients; their
phagocytic function is preserved or even compensatorily
increased, as has been reported by
other authors also [36]. No particular changes

Infectious Complications and Host Immune Defense in Acute Leukemia 621
in humoral factors were observed. In this period
infections are less frequent and they arise
mainly in granulocytopenic patients in whom
the cellular antibacterial defense is inhibited
by quantitative changes in granulocytes. The
increased IgM values in infected patients may
be considered as an expression of an early
humoral immune response against the pathogenic
agents.
During induction chemotherapy marked
granulocytopenia is established in all patients,
accompanied by functional disorders in the
granulocytes. These changes lead to a strongly
reduced phagocytic capacity. The bactericidal
activity of granulocytes is also suppressed,
most probably in connection with an impaired
metabolism and enzyme synthesis [13, 15, 16].
Consequently, with the suppressed cellular
antibacterial resistance, the frequency of infectious
complications is augmented, as well as
the percentage of patients with severe infections.
The increased IgG levels during that
period in some of the infected patients most
probably reflects the synthesis of antibodies
against bacterial antigens. High levels of immunoglobulins
during the active stage of
acute leukemia is reported by other authors as
well [19, 36]. However, these authors do not
follow the association of immunoglobulins
with the infections concomitant to the basic
disorder. The decreased complement activity
of the serum may be explained first of all by
the suppressed synthesis of the complement
components as a result of the administered
cytostatic agents or of a leukemic infiltration
of the reticuloendothelial organs. It is highly
probable also that its cause lies in the consumption
of complement in the course of
bacteriolysis, or in its utilization along the
alternative pathway by the lipopolysaccharides
of Gram negative micro-organisms.
Both in that period of the disease and in the
preceding one no persistent correlation between
serum lysozyme levels and the frequency
and severity of bacterial infections has
been established.
The most pronounced immunosuppression
is observed in patients in relapse, most proably
in connection with previous courses of
more or less prolonged chemotherapy. Parallel
to the quantitative and functional damage of
the cellular granulocytic antibacterial defense
there occurs a reduction of all humoral immune
factors. Infections are most frequent in
this stage, with the highest percentage of
sepsis and disseminated infection.
The relationship between factors of host immune
defense and infectious complications in
acute leukemia patients clearly reveals the
significance both of cellular and humoral immunity.
Granulocyte function undergoes the
earliest and most profound changes, while the
humoral factors become affected later, during
intensive induction chemotherapy and particularly
in relapse, when one may witness a
complete failure of host immune defense.
Those facts should be remembered in the
prophylaxis and management of infectious
complications in acute leukemia.
