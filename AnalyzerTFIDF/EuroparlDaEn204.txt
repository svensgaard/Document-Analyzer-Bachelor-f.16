Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Tuesday , 23 March 1999 .
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen , a terrible fire broke out in the Mont Blanc tunnel on 24 March killing at least 40 people , some of whom have yet to be identified .
The scale of this tragedy caused great dismay not only in France and Italy , but throughout the European Union .
Although it occurred some weeks ago , I am sure I am speaking for all of us in expressing our sorrow at these deaths and our sympathy for the victims ' families .
We hope that the investigations being carried out will prevent such tragedies from occurring in the future .
Agenda
The next item is the order of business .
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed . The following amendments have been proposed .
Monday and Tuesday : no changes
Wednesday :
At the request of Mrs Bonino , who has to return to Brussels to prepare for humanitarian measures relating to Kosovo , I am proposing that we take the report by Mr BÃ¶ge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the BSE follow-up before the report by Mr Herman on the functioning of the institutions .
If this debate is not concluded before Question Time , it will be continued immediately afterwards , before the suspension of the sitting .
If there are no objections , we shall take that to be approved .
Are there any comments ?
Parliament approved the proposal
The Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking for the report by Mrs Myller , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , on accession strategies for environment , to be brought forward from Friday to Wednesday and included in the joint debate on the seven reports by the Foreign Affairs Committee on accession applications .
Mrs Green has the floor to present this request .
Mr President , it seems entirely logical that this report , which is dealing with the enlargement of the European Union , should be taken with the pre-accession reports on Wednesday .
We would ask that it is brought forward and taken at the same time
Thank you , Mrs Green .
Does anyone wish to speak in favour of or against this request ?
That does not seem to be the case .
I put to the vote the request by the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
Parliament approved the request
Thursday :
The Group of the European People 's Party is asking for the joint debate on financial services - the reports by Mr Crowley on collective investment in transferable securities and Mr Fayot on a framework for action for financial services - to be brought forward from Friday to Thursday morning .
I would remind the House that the first item on Thursday morning is the joint debate on the two annual reports by the Committee on Petitions , in which the European Ombudsman will be taking part .
The reports by Mr Crowley and Mr Fayot can in any event only be taken after that debate .
Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has the floor to present this request on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party .
Mr President , I have just been able to have a word with the rapporteur , and as I understand it , we shall be very happy if the Crowley report and the Fayot report can be voted on in May .
So we have no changes to make to the agenda , assuming we can agree on that .
Our services tell me that there is no difficulty with that .
The agenda for Thursday therefore remains unchanged , and the request by the Group of the European People 's Party is withdrawn .
Friday : no changes
The order of business was adopted thus amended
Mr Ephremidis has the floor .
Mr President , as you have now come to the end of the amendments to the agenda , I am struck by the fact - and I think it will come as some surprise to the public that is following the debates of this Parliament - that , though the issues on the agenda are important and interesting , we are nevertheless facing a war in Yugoslavia !
This is a war which threatens to spread to the whole of the Balkans and goodness knows where else .
Perhaps therefore , on your own initiative and on that of this Parliament , we should debate this issue in the presence of the Council and the Commission , since it concerns the present and the future of the people in the Balkans and in Europe .
War !
Has the penny not dropped that people are being slaughtered , that a major disaster is unfolding ?
I am not concerned about where the responsibility lies .
We will find this out in due course and we will discuss it in good faith .
What are we going to do to stop this threat against the people of the Balkans and of Europe ?
Mr President , I feel very strongly about this issue , because people of my age have lived through such events . But I also feel strongly because of the position the country I represent finds itself in .
Mr Ephremidis , we all enjoy your speeches but what you are requesting is already included in the agenda .
On Wednesday afternoon , a debate will be held on the situation in Kosovo , following the statements by the Council and the Commission on this issue .
This will naturally incorporate the corresponding resolutions , which are to be tabled this afternoon .
Parliament has therefore already taken the situation into consideration .
Civil liberties
The next item is the joint debate on :
the report ( A4-0133 / 99 ) by Mr Bontempi , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on the draft action plan of the Council and Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom , security and justice ( 13844 / 98 - C4-0692 / 98-98 / 0923 ( CNS ) ) ; -the proposal for a recommendation ( A4-0064 / 99 ) by Mr Nassauer , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on Europol : reinforcing parliamentary controls and extending powers ; -the report ( A4-0091 / 99 ) by Mr Wiebenga , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on criminal procedures in the European Union ( Corpus Juris ) ; -the report ( A4-0141 / 99 ) by Mr Schmid , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on the draft joint action , adopted by the Council on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union , to combat child pornography on the Internet ( 10850 / 5 / 98 - C4-0674 / 98-98 / 0917 ( CNS ) ) ; -the report ( A4-0185 / 99 ) by Mrs d 'Ancona , on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs , on the report , including key elements of a post-1999 EU drugs strategy , from the Council to the European Council on activities on drugs and drugs-related issues under the UK Presidency ( 7930 / 2 / 98 - C4-0409 / 98 ) .The rapporteurs will have the floor in the order in which their reports have been announced .
Mr Bontempi is therefore the first speaker .
Mr President , today 's sitting is an important one , not only for our committee , which has been working on these matters for months , but above all - I hope - for the European people .
This thorough groundwork - resulting in the reports which I hope the House will adopt - for the extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Tampere , which is to lay down the guidelines for future EU policy on security and justice , is a most important contribution .
Everyone realises that the greatest innovation of the Amsterdam Treaty - due to enter into force a few days from now , on 1 May - is the ' area of freedom , security and justice ' , a brand new concept which constitutes a major step forward for the Union , following the establishment of a single currency and the attempts to launch a policy on employment .
Indeed , to involve the Union in fulfilling such fundamental requirements as freedom , security and justice is , firstly , to recognise the close linkage between these three requirements , none of which can be fulfilled without the other two - after all , freedom is only meaningful in a secure environment , based on a reliable legal system - and , secondly , to regard the Union as the appropriate framework for the protection and furtherance of such values , irrespective of individual legal traditions or practices .
The other merit of this new and innovative part of the Treaty is that it is fundamentally , explicitly and clearly based on protection , promotion and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
By expressly recalling these principles and , what is more , setting out a procedure for calling to order Member States which fail to respect them , the Fifteen have finally laid the foundations for a European public order , for which the European Convention on Human Rights is the handbook and the area of freedom , security and justice the most obvious expression .
Therefore , we really are facing a significant turning-point in the life of the Union . Our concern , owing to the pitfalls dotted throughout the Treaty itself in the numerous clauses and the usual complex structure , is that in order to achieve the anticipated results in this field , all the institutions will have to engage in a fully-fledged war , or perhaps battle .
I say this because our task is complicated by the surviving distinction between the first and third pillars and of unanimous voting within the Council , plus the weakness of parliamentary control both nationally and in the EU .
This report has already been discussed at a conference with the national parliaments , with representatives of governments and of European civil society , and a broad measure of consensus has , I believe , been achieved .
The report is the result of intense cooperation among the political groups ; I should especially like to draw attention to the amendments on which we shall be voting tomorrow , almost all of them making significant improvements , put forward by Mrs Palacio on behalf of the PPE Group .
I think we were right to work together in this way , since much is expected of us and we must uphold certain principles : solidarity - the Member States must cooperate in this field , since only by doing so and by overcoming national apathy and egoism will we achieve our aim ; a commitment to transparency , which must apply to the conduct of all parties , including the Council ; and , in a clear break with tradition , a commitment to full participation in the decision-making process .
Only recently , Parliament 's role - a key role in the democratic process but also a factor of efficiency - was still being ignored .
I would say in conclusion that this report represents a call for guarantees and effectiveness .
The Council has to understand that , when it comes to sensitive matters concerning citizenship and legality , unless there is ample cooperation not only with the European Parliament but also with national parliaments and civil society , it will be hard to make our existing array of virtual laws comprehensible and meaningful to the people .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europol will finally begin its work on 1 July , by which time approximately four years will have passed since the legal basis for a European Police Office was laid down in the Maastricht Treaty .
For Europol these have been four difficult years during which its establishment has been delayed and obstructed , not least because of so-called national sovereignty .
And I fear that these four years of national sovereignty have served no purpose whatsoever .
The fact that Europol could not begin its work , however , has undoubtedly given organised crime in Europe a further advantage .
For this reason we want Europol not only to be able to begin work on 1 July but also to be able to work effectively from this date .
The European Parliament supports the work that is due to begin on 1 July .
Even in its first report the European Parliament was cautiously in favour of extending Europol 's powers .
We proposed considering giving it operational powers .
This does not mean a European FBI that could take responsibility for prosecution , nor does it mean armed and uniformed Europol officers arresting criminals .
None of this is part of Europol 's tasks .
What we mean is that Europol should have the power to coordinate cross-border investigations responsibly and the accompanying right to issue instructions to national police authorities .
This is the cautious path that the European Parliament has chosen .
We are calling for this not because we are blindly demanding policing rights for Europe but because these demands are in line with policing needs .
If organised crime is planned , organised and carried out centrally , it makes sense that we should equip ourselves with a prosecution authority that also plans and acts centrally .
This is why we need Europol .
Any police authorities which have the right to encroach on citizens ' rights need parliamentary controls .
Europol is currently a purely intergovernmental organisation , and as a result the European Parliament has no powers of supervision .
Under the Treaty we are to be given only occasional and limited information , but we cannot exercise controls .
Monitoring Europol is therefore clearly the task of the national parliaments , and I can only call upon our counterparts in the national parliaments to do their duty here .
This is also appropriate as things stand at present .
In the area of data processing Europol has only very limited rights of intervention , but there are now almost universal demands that Europol 's rights be extended .
The Treaty of Amsterdam , which will enter into force in only a matter of days , points in this direction .
The President-in-Office surprised us here only a few weeks ago when he called for Europol to have operational powers to take action .
If that is the case we must certainly review the issue of parliamentary control .
The idea of Europol being controlled by 15 national parliaments in The Hague is totally unrealistic .
We also do not want some parliament to be constantly looking over Europol 's shoulder in The Hague to see what it is doing , as this would also be nonsense .
However , parliamentary control means that this police unit must be placed under the responsibility of a political body that in turn must be answerable to parliament .
This is what parliamentary control means .
So if Europol acquires new powers - as we hope - we need a Commissioner who is responsible for Europol , and the task of monitoring this body must be transferred to the European Parliament .
Only on this condition , rather than in any event , do we call for new rights for Europol . In other words , we call for these rights only if parliamentary control is possible .
That is what we are insisting on in this report .
Applause
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for many people the Internet has allowed access to a wealth of stored information .
In social terms it could almost be described as a revolution , one in which participation in knowledge is made generally accessible .
The Internet is therefore something positive and cannot be blamed simply because , like other instruments of communication , it is misused for the purpose of criminal activities .
No one would dream of saying that the telephone is something bad just because criminals also use it .
One of the criminal activities found on the Internet is the trade in and exchange of child pornography material .
The alarming thing about child pornography is not the fact that it is pornography , in other words that it involves images of naked people involved in sexual acts .
When this takes place among adults it is not a criminal offence .
I find it disgusting but there are people who do like it .
The reason child pornography has been made a criminal offence is that it involves the portrayal of real live children being sexually abused .
That is what is disturbing about it .
In the interest of children , therefore , prosecution must continue to be possible .
Of course trading and exchanging child pornography material existed in the past , before the Internet was introduced .
It is nothing new .
But it was difficult for individuals to find a supplier since things that are against the law cannot be advertised publicly .
What is new is the possibility , via the Internet , to supply and trade worldwide , and to do so under conditions that make prosecution considerably more difficult .
It is therefore right that the Member States have proposed joint action , on the basis of Article K.3 of the Maastricht Treaty , to combat child pornography on the Internet more effectively .
However , the proposal is full of phrases talking about having to look into things or referring to possible courses of action .
Hardly any concrete or binding decisions are taken .
This reminds me of the remark attributed to the Austrian Emperor Franz Josef , who is believed to have once said ' Gentlemen , something must be done , but nothing must be changed ! ' This is a good description of the present Council proposal .
The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has therefore tried , by means of amendments , to make the non-binding phrases in the text binding so that there is some point to all of this .
Secondly , there are two places where we are trying to make it possible to prosecute such acts on the Internet .
Two problems arise in dealing with the prosecution of child pornography .
The first is that there is no uniform protective age for children , which makes it incredibly difficult in the case of cross-border investigations .
The second is that such material is very often put on the Internet using anonymous electronic mail , so that the image that appears in a news group cannot be traced back to the individual responsible .
We are therefore calling for anonymous e-mail to be prohibited or at least largely restricted .
A few comments , Mr President , to add to my report on the Council report on a post-1999 European Union drugs strategy .
I will start on a positive note .
For the first time , we have seen the Committee on Civil Liberties able to approve a report on drugs virtually unanimously - it was unanimous really , but for one abstention .
That says something about the fact that , by virtue of having listened to one another over the years , we have at least made a start on taking ideology out of the debate on drugs .
I think that is a good thing .
In this instance it was rather easier , because as rapporteur I did not have to talk about a completely new drugs policy , but was able simply to give a verdict on the strategy first mooted under the UK Presidency .
My committee was unanimous in agreeing with that verdict .
To start with , we thought that under Article K.6 of the EU Treaty and given the codecision procedure , we should have been consulted beforehand .
We thought too that the Council should have drawn on Parliament 's various pronouncements on dugs .
We have already adopted so many reports on drugs over the years that the Council should have looked at them .
There is not really any sign that they did so .
We thought too that account should have been taken of the findings of an evaluation study , because we now have the excellent monitoring centre for drugs .
How can you draw up a new strategy if you have no idea what the effects were of the old strategy followed between 1995 and 1999 ?
So we were highly critical on that count .
Stranger still is the fact that the Commission will be unveiling its 2000-2005 action plan on drugs any day now , when we in Parliament do not know exactly what the relationship is between the Council 's plan and that of the Commission .
From what I have heard , the Commission plan is in any event more ambitious than that of the Council .
I hope that will prove to be the case ; it is the impression I have formed from one thing and another .
These criticisms have of course prompted us to make a number of recommendations .
We think there has to be better coordination of policy on drugs , and our committee has adopted an amendment to the effect that in the near future we want to see a Commissioner given responsibility for coordinating drugs policy within the Commission .
I think the current Commissioner will also have had a hard time of it , given that the responsibility was spread so widely .
Both for us and the Commission , it would have been better if just one Commissioner , Mrs Gradin for example , had been the Commissioner responsible for coordinating policy on drugs .
A second recommendation I would mention is that we feel strongly that better use should be made of the European monitoring centre .
I find it absurd that the Council does not draw on research findings .
And it would be a good idea , now that the Council and the Commission - perhaps both of them - are drawing up a new and coordinated strategy , if meanwhile we were to build in fixed reference points , reference points which will allow us to see later whether the strategy has worked well , in which respects it did not work well or worked poorly .
We have also advocated better and more intelligent use of the UNDCP in providing substitute crops , not by destroying drug harvests in third world countries , but by adopting an integrated approach to development which offers a real alternative to poor people in those countries .
There are some good examples of this .
Lastly , we have done our best , myself as rapporteur but above all the committee as a whole , to strike a balance between prevention and information , reducing the risks to health and the opportunities provided by a coordinated approach on justice .
In accepting amendments , I am keen to preserve that balance .
So I shall not comment on whether or not I like some of the amendments .
I think the balance we have struck needs to be preserved in the plenary too - a balance which will be established in practice if the Member States can pool their practical experience as far as possible .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur , Mr Bontempi , talked today about weak points in the implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam which affect the implementation of the Schengen Agreement .
The Committee on Institutional Affairs , on whose behalf I am speaking here today , sees these as much more than weak points . In fact , it sees them as critical developments for civil rights , the rule of law and the role of Parliament in the area of internal security .
I believe it is important to draw the attention of the House to this today .
Our criticism applies even to the way in which Parliament is being consulted , which is unfortunately nothing new .
The Commission shows little intention of involving Parliament in any serious way in this vital issue .
In a letter of 9 December 1998 we were asked to deliver an opinion , but the Council of Justice Ministers had already adopted the action plan on 3 December .
Here consultation becomes a farce , and the inclusion of Parliament nothing other than a pretence .
Our second criticism concerns the Treaty of Amsterdam itself , which says little or nothing about the institutional framework in which the freedom of movement for persons is to be realised .
On the implementation of the Schengen Agreement there is merely a protocol .
The crucial question of whether the Schengen acquis should be incorporated in the first or third pillar , in accordance with Article 4 or Article 6 , has not been settled .
This has serious implications for the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and for Parliament 's right of codecision after five years , and there are also serious implications for the budget .
The whole question of the legal status of Schengen has not even been settled yet .
As the preparations show today , the Council seems to have no desire to choose the democratic , constitutional method , with the full involvement of the Court of Justice and the European Parliament .
I believe these are not weak points but truly dangerous developments for the rule of law and for democracy .
Mr President , my colleague Luigi Florio was to speak as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights but as he is not here , I shall speak instead .
I am going to be somewhat more positive than my colleague Mr Voggenhuber and I am also going to mention a point that was raised by Mr Bontempi .
Indeed , I would like to thank Mr Bontempi , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , for his cooperation , and in a moment I will also have the opportunity of thanking him on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party .
Mr Bontempi said that what we are dealing with is a very complex structure .
What this actually means is that we have to incorporate Title IV on visas , asylum and the free movement of persons ; a substantial part of what remains under the third pillar ; the Schengen acquis through the relevant protocol ; and the special protocols .
It could not be any more complex .
This is the major challenge we must face if - as Mr Bontempi also pointed out - we want the European Union to change for the better and become a Union that represents guarantees and efficiency , citizenship and lawfulness .
We are ready to meet that challenge .
The Committee on Legal Affairs stressed the importance of the following issues , which are also covered in Mr Bontempi 's report : the right to a fair trial with all assurances , the guarantee of access to justice - which should include granting aid where those involved cannot afford to go to court - and the presumption of innocence as a fundamental principle of European law .
The Committee on Legal Affairs also highlighted an issue that has been mentioned in other reports : the need to monitor jurisdiction .
It is possible that during this very complex process , we may pay less attention to monitoring jurisdiction . We must therefore ensure that such a measure is taken and we must also demand that Parliament be given the right to exercise democratic control .
If we do not exercise democratic control and monitor jurisdiction , we will never get past the stage where Europe is simply a market and we will be unable to rise to the challenge we are now facing .
Mr President , we have a group of five reports and I should like to congratulate all the rapporteurs .
They have all done a very good job in producing reports which make an important contribution to this issue .
I should like first of all to focus on the justice and home affairs area which is covered by Mr Bontempi 's and Mr Wiebenga 's reports .
They make a valuable contribution by stressing the need for the European Union to achieve a greater degree of harmonisation and of cooperation in this area .
It is an area that has been sadly neglected compared with the great strides which the Union has made in harmonisation in the fields of economic and financial policy , agriculture , transport , the environment , etc .
This area of justice and home affairs and freedom has lagged far behind .
It is not that we want every country to adopt the same legal and judicial system - that would be absurd .
Indeed , even within certain regions of existing Member States there are long-standing differences in the way that the law is administered and operated .
We need much greater cooperation .
We are facing a situation where we have a proliferation of organised crime on an international basis .
The criminals do not worry about issues of subsidiarity and frontier controls and whether the niceties of national law versus European law are properly abided by - they operate in whatever way makes them the biggest profit and achieves their objectives .
Unless we are able to establish a proper system of international cooperation in this area then we will not be able to deal effectively with these issues .
This is also important in order to protect the rights of individuals .
There is a tremendous disparity in criminal and indeed in civil law .
There are many activities which are criminal in some countries but not in others .
Sentencing policy varies widely .
This is becoming more and more important as greater numbers of our citizens and residents of the European Union are working , living and carrying out their activities in other Member States .
It is unacceptable that somebody should have fewer legal rights if they are charged with an offence in a country other than their own than they would in their own country .
Furthermore , problems have arisen of people being held for long periods without trial because of bureaucratic delays caused by translation problems and because of the lack of proper legal aid .
These matters must be tackled and resolved , and the reports suggest some very important and useful ways in which that can be done .
Mr Nassauer 's report on Europol has the balance right .
We must have effective collaboration between national police forces , and the Europol Convention provides for the proper and effective exchange of information to enable the police forces of our Member States to cooperate and to act more effectively by proper interchange of information , ideas and practices .
Without this , police forces operating in the sphere of law and order will be working with one hand tied behind their backs compared with the criminal organisations .
One thing Parliament has always stressed from the very inception of Europol is that any international police organisation - perhaps in the course of time with operational powers , however limited they may be - can only be allowed to exist if there is a proper system of democratic control and accountability - just as we would expect proper democratic accountability by our own national police forces .
We must respect the principle that policing can take place only with the consent of the communities being served .
Police forces that see themselves as some kind of external force coming in to impose rules and operations which are not acceptable to the community at large will fail .
We need good effective policing with the consent of the communities .
Finally , Mrs d 'Ancona 's report on the complex and vexed area of drugs balances very difficult issues : the question of not condoning the use of dangerous drugs but , at the same time , recognising that a purely punitive approach to this issue will never succeed and that there must be proper emphasis on education , health matters and so on .
It is a good balanced approach to this issue .
Mr President , I should like to begin by touching briefly on Mr Wiebenga 's report on criminal procedures ( Corpus Juris ) .
It is an excellent report which deals with a particularly sensitive and neglected area .
The report should be seen as a step on the road towards increased coordination of criminal law in the EU , which is something that is desirable .
At the same time , certain differences in the Member States ' legal systems must be respected in any coordination process .
It is emphasised in the report that national legal traditions should be respected , thereby enabling the Corpus Juris project to proceed on a realistic basis .
This debate also includes Mr Bontempi 's report concerning an action plan on an area of freedom , security and justice , and I have nothing but good to say about it .
It includes all our main prerequisites from a legal point of view .
I should now like to move on to Mrs d 'Ancona 's more controversial report on the EU 's strategies in the battle against drugs .
I am pleased that we have succeeded in persuading the Social Democrats to agree that the drugs issue is sufficiently important to be discussed in plenary , so that our citizens are kept informed .
The report specifically reflects the idea that it really is a battle against drugs - and that means all drugs .
Such an approach ought to underlie the strategy which the Commission is drawing up .
The very long drawn-out and intensive discussions on drugs which have taken place during the present term have shown where the boundaries of cooperation lie in this area .
The committee has scored a notable success in that the report makes no further mention of prescribing heroin as a means of combating drug abuse .
But nor is prescribing methadone for drug addicts a satisfactory way of helping them to overcome their dependency .
We therefore regard the development of less addictive alternatives to methadone as a hopeful sign which should resolve the remaining political difficulties in terms of the way in which the majority in the House views the drugs issue .
The ultimate objective is , of course , the total eradication of all dependency on drugs and pharmaceutical preparations .
The approach of the PPE Group has been successful .
Mrs d 'Ancona , the rapporteur , has been very willing to cooperate and listen to our point of view .
I should therefore like to praise , in particular , her perceptiveness as regards the appropriate approach to take in the area of drugs .
The report before us today is significantly more balanced than previous proposals .
The debate in Parliament has played an important role .
To begin with , we adopted a very different position from everyone else , but now we have arrived at a common European approach .
Those of us who come from the Nordic countries have succeeded in gaining sympathy for some of the basic common principles we apply in combating drugs-related problems in our countries .
The report conveys a clear message about the actions required to reduce supply and demand .
My long-term goal is a drugs-free society , and I believe that the fight against drugs in Europe in the future will be underpinned by the same three basic elements that we in Sweden have for so long held to be essential in the battle against drugs , namely prevention , repression and rehabilitation .
Mr President , firstly we must thank all the rapporteurs for their work , as these reports deal with an area at the very heart of European values , namely the principle of the rule of law .
I believe it is very important that we remind ourselves that social mobility and the integration of the people of Europe must be accompanied by harmonisation of the law .
In my opinion , therefore , it is not a disadvantage but in fact important that we should bring our civil law and in particular our criminal law into line in response to the fact that we in Europe are living increasingly close together .
I also consider it important that we place great emphasis on legal culture not being lost in practice .
This applies in particular to future members in Central and Eastern Europe .
We are already seeing in the accession talks and preparations that it is very difficult there to identify , support or promote a legal culture that allows people to live together in a common economic and legal framework and in an area of freedom and democracy .
With regard to fundamental rights , I would say the following .
Mr Nassauer referred to Europol .
It is very important for us to have effective policing instruments , but they must be accompanied by judicial and parliamentary monitoring instruments .
In my view it is not enough that only the national parliaments should fulfil this role .
The European Court of Justice and in future also the European Parliament should have a very crucial monitoring function here .
My last point concerns the right of asylum .
It is very important for Europe to be open and we must ensure that asylum does not fall by the wayside .
We must also ensure that the burden is shared fairly within the European Community .
The right of asylum must be considered as a sacred European value .
We will not tolerate anything less .
Mr President , today 's debate is timely as the 50th Eurobarometer report which has just been published clearly shows that concerns about unemployment are only just higher than the citizens ' desire for action against drugs and crime .
I want to say straight away that I do not support the resolution calling for the appointment of an independent European public prosecutor .
However , it must be safe for European citizens to walk in their neighbourhoods .
It must be safe to do business in Europe without fear of financial fraud .
It must be safe for children to attend school without fear of being lured into drugs .
It must be safe for children to use the information highway and not be abused by deviants using the Internet for pornographic purposes .
Paedophilia on the Internet must be prosecuted .
The European Union , in line with the commitment entered into in the Amsterdam Treaty , must become an area of freedom , security and justice where citizens enjoy a high level of safety .
Next October governments will hold a special meeting to consider the establishment of a European area of freedom , security and justice .
They must put forward a common strategy which recognises and responds to the clearly established demands of our European citizens for action against drugs and crime .
Organised crime operates at a professional level .
It has enormous resources and access to the latest technology , which it can use to subvert democracy and for the purposes of money laundering and fraud .
It is essential that police cooperation in connection with Europol be extended to new areas such as counterfeiting Euro notes and coins .
I believe that convicted drug barons should be given a minimum forty-year jail sentence in view of the fact that the European Union does not have the death penalty .
The European Union must be equally professional and use all its combined forces to tackle these crime barons throughout the European Union .
As far as possible serious crime must carry penalties which result in long jail terms .
In my own constituency in Dublin only this weekend I have seen a family who have lost two young women during the last year as a result of drug abuse .
It must be one of the priorities of the European Union to tackle drugs .
There is no point in people coming into this House and talking about liberal proposals when you look around and see young people dying from drug abuse , while the people who import and sell these drugs are getting away scot-free .
We must give every cooperation to Europol and do everything we can to prevent this drug abuse .
Mr President , as the rapporteur , Mr Nassauer , has already said , parliamentary supervision of Europol 's police activities of is one of the most important tasks of this House , particularly for us as politicians concerned with home affairs .
For this reason we in the Green Group in the European Parliament consider it to be very important that Europol , as an intergovernmental organisation , does not acquire any additional powers that would be inconceivable for our national police authorities and that violate the rights of EU citizens .
An example is the Protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol .
Of course we are in favour of Europol as a European authority that is necessary for the internal security of the European Union and plays a crucial role in cooperation between national police authorities .
But we are in favour of a European authority that can be democratically controlled .
Police activity needs to be supervised above all in areas where it interferes with civil rights , especially fundamental rights .
For this reason we are not satisfied with the current supervision of Europol that is supposedly carried out by the national parliaments .
Mr Nassauer has made some good proposals , which we welcome .
But they are not sufficient .
In our opinion it is very important that parliamentary supervision of Europol 's police activities should be carried out by the European Parliament , but there are unfortunately still no proposals that would allow us to exercise genuine control .
Mr President , Commissioner , we naturally support the majority of the points made in each of these reports , that is , the reports by Mr Wiebenga , Mr Nassauer and Mr Schmid .


I would like to take a moment to look at the report by Mr Bontempi as , in my view , it is extremely important and it covers almost all the areas that still require work in this process of European integration .
Firstly , as regards the communitarisation of judicial and police cooperation , all the points highlighted are of fundamental importance . These include reducing the length of asylum procedures , establishing conditions and procedures for issuing visas , moving towards a uniform visa , defining a statute for legal immigrants , and effectively combating illegal immigration .
We are also very much in favour of the free movement of legal immigrants between the Member States .
We will finally be able to guarantee that all decisions are taken impartially and , above all , that those most directly affected can have complete peace of mind .
As far as police cooperation is concerned , the development of Europol and the use of databases are vital . It is also essential to eventually incorporate the Schengen information system into Europol 's activities .
However , many countries are still reluctant to allow the judicial authorities of one Member State to operate in the territory of another Member State .
We need to resolve this issue and move towards a general harmonisation of our laws on most offences and crimes .
In terms of creating an area of freedom , security and justice , we believe that freedom is the most important aspect , and we will have to integrate the Schengen acquis into our own operations .
Two key objectives must be retained .
The first will involve dealing with the crisis we are experiencing in Europe today , that is , the incidences of mass immigration , by collectively offering temporary protection on a large scale to those who are the victims of persecution .
In any event , the right of asylum must be based , now and in the future , on the fundamental legislation we already have , in other words the Geneva Convention and the other protocols .
Finally , as far as security is concerned , we need to combat organised crime and eradicate the living conditions that have given rise to violence in our cities and hooliganism .
I would like to say a brief word about the report by Mrs d 'Ancona on the use of illegal substances .
It is interesting to note that it in no way calls into question the policy pursued up to now in relation to the use of these substances , which has yet to produce any convincing results , and that is the least we might say about it .
The collective progress made have not been taken into account and no consideration given to the assessment of the experiments currently under way .
A certain degree of caution and a conservative attitude were adopted and resulted in an agreement on the lowest common denominator .
Realism has , however , now prevailed in favour of a multisectoral approach .
Mr President , the report by our colleague Mr Schmid raises some very valid points and puts forward some excellent ideas , particularly the proposal to prohibit the sending of anonymous e-mail .
However , in my opinion , this report has one fundamental flaw : it makes a distinction between pornography that is supposed to be acceptable and child pornography , which is the only type that is supposed to be reprehensible . I refuse to accept this .
First of all , it claims that the problem of identifying the age of a child is extremely delicate and that there is no solution . However , ladies and gentlemen , it is pornography itself - just like racism and other evils we quite rightly condemn - that must be looked on as an attack on human dignity and respect , which form one of the cornerstones of our democracies .
Otherwise , how are we going to arrest those involved in child pornography who are so unbalanced as to end up actually committing the act because of having constantly watched pornographic tapes involving adults ?
There is a certain lack of realism here and I have great difficulty in making any sense of it .
As regards the report by our colleague Mrs d 'Ancona , again I am not going to look at this matter in terms of its many economic problems and the distinction between the crackdown on traffickers , which must be ruthless , and the approach focusing basically on young people , since it is a very delicate issue as far as they are concerned .
Instead , I will look at an aspect that , to my mind , is vital and that does not receive enough attention .
We are told that we must look at the issue from the supply side and this is certainly true .
But why do young people use drugs ?
How have we failed ?
Adults throughout Europe must examine their consciences , be they parents , teachers , social leaders or , in fact , any adults that come into contact with young people , in other words all of us .
We must ask ourselves why we have not managed to provide our young people with reasons to live , with the desire to live , and with the moral strength to face the difficulties we all encounter throughout our lives .
Life on earth has always been very difficult .
There is a basic problem here that should lead us to work together and on that level . In conclusion , I would like to draw your attention to a particular point : we are constantly talking about language teaching , but from an increasingly utilitarian point of view .
Instead , if we made literature , the great literature of all our European countries , accessible to young people once again , it would perhaps set them on the right track and prevent them from getting involved in drugs and other such behaviour .
Mr President , the prospect of Europol as an effective instrument to combat organised crime has been held out for longer than I have been in this House .
Yet it has still not been set up .
The preparatory work has not yet progressed far enough to allow it to become fully operational in The Hague .
Of course we are all interested in a functional Europol as an appropriate weapon against organised crime .
It is generally recognised that we need an effective instrument in the fight against crime that is increasing particularly in qualitative terms .
However , instead of vehemently demanding that the preparatory work be concluded , today we are discussing a development that goes too far and , in our opinion , in the wrong direction .
The security aspect does not require Europol officers to be given the right to issue instructions to national officers , not does it require the setting-up of a central European body .
For these reasons we reject the report .
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party and I think that at this stage we need to take a clear look at the situation .
The European conscience is clearly experiencing a significant and undoubtedly serious crisis at the moment .
Public opinion has developed in our Member States to the point where people now want much more than the plan that limited European integration to the completion of the single market .
I do not think there is any doubt today that the people of Europe hope and believe that rather than being just a common market , Europe is a project for civilization .
I did not want to have to mention the recent situation in Kosovo and the need for Europe to assert itself on the international stage , but I think that it is unavoidable .
However , for Europe to assert itself in this way , we must ensure that Europe is clearly defined and consolidated internally : it cannot be just a market .
The democratic process in the Member States is extremely demanding and we , as representatives of the people , must be aware that through our work , with this Bontempi report and with the four reports that are also being debated today , we must take the Treaty of Amsterdam to its legal limit .
The Treaty of Amsterdam is clearly our legal framework , but we must take it as far as we can in terms of the legal scope it offers . And , where this is not sufficient , we must make a clear commitment to change the Treaty in order to meet what has become an obvious demand from the people .
The Tampere summit is therefore very important , since the Member States are going to tackle all these issues at the very highest level .
The report by Mr Bontempi is significant because it defines what we are actually hoping for in terms of the area of freedom , security and justice that is currently proposed by the Treaty .
The Tampere summit is going to put this all into practice , and the Bontempi report sets out certain fundamental ideas here .
I would naturally like to thank Mr Bontempi for his kind words about me .
I must say that I had the benefit of the fullest cooperation during my work on this document and I am as proud as he is of the final result , which I hope will receive the support of the majority of the House tomorrow .
We believe that we must clearly define the fundamental rights we want to have and determine at what legal level we want them to be established .
We want to put an end to discrimination and we hope that a sense of European citizenship can be developed . We also feel that issues such as the free movement of persons , visas and immigration - and I am not going to go back over the events that are taking place at the moment - all need to be resolved as soon as possible if we want to make any progress on the objective set out in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Further , we must improve the public 's access to justice .
They must feel that they are protected by all the legal systems throughout Europe , rather than believing that , as far as justice is concerned , there is no difference between being involved in a legal dispute with a French citizen than with a citizen of any other country in the world , as someone in Spain once said to me .
Finally , we must change our working methods and the way in which the institutions cooperate .
These are the main issues covered in the Bontempi report .
In conclusion , I would like to thank the rapporteurs of the other reports , which relate to the three cornerstones of freedom , security and justice , and I would stress how important they are .
Mr President , there is something unusual about this joint debate on several reports .
The very way in which the reports are divided gives the impression that the challenges we face are fragmented . Yet there is no doubt that we are dealing with the very crux of European integration and the European project to build a community of citizens .
Mr Bontempi 's report leaves me with the impression of a form of European citizenship that evolves progressively , almost in stages , through the positive step of establishing a number of freedoms , but also - and we have already seen this in the progress made on the free movement of persons - by creating a new category : the Community citizen who is no longer a complete foreigner in any of our countries .
The idea of fragmentation is heightened when we see that certain concepts are ignored , particularly the concept of secularism . This is at the heart of European citizenship as defined by the Treaty of Amsterdam through fundamental rights that transcend any division into categories , beliefs , dogmas , ethnic groups or religions .
In Europe , we are building an area of freedom and citizenship which goes further than that and which is much more important .
That is precisely what the founding fathers of republican secularism hoped to do : they wanted to tear our people away from concentrating on their separate identities and to instead focus their attention on the universal nature of rights .
In conclusion , I would just like to say that it is unfortunate that this basic dimension of secularism is not dealt with in detail in such an important debate .
Mr President , the purpose of these reports is to give an interpretation of how cooperation in the European Union between police and justice authorities ought to function .
Mr Nassauer rightly points to Europol 's lack of accountability .
I believe the answer to this lies with the national parliaments and the Council .
Broadening Europol and giving it police powers amongst other things seems to me a very bad idea , in view of the problems we have at present with scrutiny and accountability .
Turning to Mr Wiebenga 's very clear report , the creation of an open Europe without internal borders has indeed prompted the need for partial harmonisation of our criminal laws .
The report itself rightly says that we do not want a European penal code .
Less logically , however , the rapporteur advocates a European public prosecutor 's office .
A solution which goes as far as that is not at all necessary .
I can be brief as regards the Schmid report : I wholeheartedly endorse it .
I have a good deal of difficulty , however , with the report by Mr Bontempi .
In a torrent of words , he covers all manner of widely divergent issues .
He stridently asserts that public opinion is outraged by the absence of European legislation in all manner of areas and the supposed dismantling of national legal systems .
The fact that he quotes this as a cause of organised crime and social problems is truly appalling .
There is no pressing public demand for something like European citizenship .
For freedom , security and justice , yes .
The way that is achieved is of little interest to most people .
To say that it can only be achieved through European policy is simply daft .
Another example is a Union charter of human rights .
The point of this completely escapes me , unless you want a European constitution as the first step towards a European state .
There is much more I could mention , but suffice it to say that I shall not be voting for this text , which is one-sided , in some parts strident and in any case muddled .
Mr President , the Austrian Emperor 's remark quoted by Mr Schmid is a very appropriate description of the draft joint action by the Council to combat child pornography .
The amendments tabled are therefore a significant improvement .
The increasing and totally unrestricted distribution of contemptible paedophile images and activities via the Internet is turning modern information technology from a blessing for humanity into a curse .
Professional crime in the area of child abuse and misuse of the Internet can only be combated successfully if the EU takes joint action and if the Member States in particular cooperate more closely with each other and with third countries .
However , for this is it necessary to harmonise certain concepts in criminal law such as age limits , otherwise totally absurd situations can arise .
For example , a German national sentenced in Belgium to five years in prison for child abuse is currently living freely in Germany and cannot be extradited because the crime he committed in Belgium is not an offence in Germany because the age limits in the two countries are different .
Mr President , I should like to concentrate on the d 'Ancona report , and I will begin by thanking the rapporteur .
We have had many debates here on drugs , some of which have been extremely intensive and emotional .
I must say that the d 'Ancona report is a great improvement on the reports we have discussed before .
In my view , it prepares the ground for an objective discussion on a future drugs policy .
It does not mean , however , that in future there will be agreement on all the details .
I do not think that will be possible , since we all come from different countries with different traditions .
In my opinion , for example , we sometimes set too much store by ' harm reduction ' , while I would prefer the emphasis to be placed on timely intervention and preventive actions .
However , I have to acknowledge that I agree with nearly all the rapporteur 's views , for example that one of the Commissioners should be given the task of trying to find alternatives to imprisonment , which has already been shown to be an unsatisfactory solution to drugs-related problems .
I also think that we should carry out an evaluation of the methods currently used to deal with the problems - we know that some methods are better than others , but there has been no proper evaluation .
Finally , I think we should be proud of one particular matter where the joint efforts of Parliament and the Commission have met with success during this period , namely in combating synthetic drugs .
If we have achieved anything through our common efforts during this parliamentary term , then it is to have begun this very important task of combating synthetic drugs .
I should like to thank my colleagues in both Parliament and the Commission for that .
Mr President , what we are really doing today is holding a security debate in two blocks .
In the first block I would like to look at the problem of drugs .
There is a simple reason for this : currently more than 5 million young people in the European Union are taking synthetic drugs .
Overall , it is clear from all the reports that drug consumption and the trade in drugs are unfortunately increasing spectacularly .
We need effective anti-drugs strategies in the European Union , but our problem here is that because we try to do so many different things as part of our strategies people do not always really know what is going on .
The anti-drugs strategies come under three pillars ; we have several action plans and a variety of reports on the drugs problem .
We urgently need to adopt a single position and recognisable strategies .
I would like to address a number of points which I believe are essential .
Firstly , we should send out a signal by trying where possible not to talk about drugs strategies but about anti-drugs strategies .
This also applies to all reports on the subject .
Secondly , we must support what we have decided here in the long term , in other words in future there must still be no liberalisation or legalisation of the production , sale or consumption of drugs .
The future of the European Union must not be one where hashish is sold in tobacconists and heroin is given on prescription .
This must never become a reality for us .
Thirdly , we must remove ideology from our drugs debate .
We need pragmatic , effective solutions ranging from prevention through repression to support for addicts .
However , I think that we should concentrate our prevention efforts on schools , because there we can reach all the young people of the European Union .
I would propose yet again that we should promote voluntary measures , and the Commissioner has also kindly promised support here .
So schools in Europe should be declared drug-free zones on a voluntary basis .
Cooperation with the chemicals industry , for example in combating precursors , should be improved and increased .
With regard to repression , the aim must be to extend Europol , support the police , promote judicial cooperation and generally to introduce help for addicts .
Finally , Europe must be seen in all its strategies to be a Community of security .
I have no fears in this respect when I look at reports such as those by Mr Nassauer and Mr Wiebenga .
These call for strong measures and I am hoping for further strong measures at the Tampere summit .
Mr President , this can be said quite simply .
The idea of introducing a common European public prosecutor should be scrapped .
We should not have a common European criminal law or public prosecutor .
We can fight crime just as effectively with the existing instruments , including Europol and the convention on extradition and mutual judicial assistance .
We can easily strengthen cooperation between Member States on investigations and the pursuit of justice , without necessarily having completely uniform rules and a European public prosecutor .
We should not harmonise for the sake of harmonising , and in fact the differences between the criminal laws of the Member States are not so great that they cannot be overcome by using existing intergovernmental instruments .
We can easily ensure effective investigations without handing them over to supranational authorities .
Europol is a good example of the fact that this is possible , and Europol should remain intergovernmental .
It must not develop into a European police authority with operational powers .
The Nassauer report proposes that Europol should be put under the direction and control of the Commission , with strengthened supervisory powers for the European Parliament .
That is a very bad idea .
Formally speaking , parliamentary supervision of Europol is well placed in the hands of the national parliaments , although one might doubt that they themselves are aware of it , so it is perhaps a good idea to also report to the European Parliament , which takes its supervisory role seriously .
Control of personal information is well placed with the national registration authorities .
Europol is a form of intergovernmental cooperation and , fortunately , the Amsterdam Treaty excludes any proposal to make police cooperation supranational .
Mr President , we all agree that supervision by Parliament of what takes place under the third pillar is important .
I only know that this has been very difficult to achieve , especially when we only have ' soft ' rights to exercise control .
I have often been extremely irritated by the fact that we look at recommendations which have been dealt with by a Council working group , but it turns out that our first chance to discover what they really mean comes at the implementation stage .
I feel that the same issues will come up again in relation to telephone tapping .
In this respect , the Council 's attitude is very important ; our rights should be respected , and we should be given enough time to be able to have our say .
One such recommendation , which is now on the point of being implemented , concerns reversing the burden of proof in respect of the seizure of property that has been criminally appropriated .
I am concerned that the rules which apply here are rather ' soft ' and can be used in a way that infringes people 's rights .
Even in my own country , Finland , the recommendation is in the process of being implemented .
Mr Bontempi , the rapporteur , would also like us to explore the possibility of having a European ' Charter ' on human rights , to be drawn up by the Union .
The German Presidency has also mentioned such a possibility .
I would say to you : let us investigate this by all means , but we should proceed with caution .
I do not believe we need any new instruments , but instead should implement those we have more effectively .
I should like to see the European Social Charter become part of the acquis communautaire , as well as the existence of effective mechanisms for following up on this .
Finally , like everyone else here , I hope that the extraordinary summit in Tampere in Finland is a success and that we come up with concrete decisions .
We do not need lengthy action programmes , but we do need concrete and balanced measures that will be of benefit to ordinary decent people .
Mr President , when the Treaty of Amsterdam becomes effective next month the Union will have a lot more scope than at present to act to ensure the single market can work effectively .
This is a good thing , but the problem is that the Member States have not up till now had a clear enough vision of how cooperation under the third pillar might be more effectively developed .
For example , there is an inexcusably wide difference in standards among the Member States when it comes to surveillance of the Union 's external borders .
The problems that are rife in the single market , such as drug trafficking , the growing availability of illegal drugs and trafficking in human beings , and the contributory cause of all such problems , which is the less than perfect way surveillance is carried out on the Union 's external borders , all call for Europol to play an even greater role in the future than is provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Europol cannot be allowed to remain just a bureaucratic central agency .
If cooperation between the police and the customs authorities cannot be made closer , the future is hardly rosy for the single market , especially as the Union 's future enlargement to the east will in any case mean extra pressures and totally new challenges with regard to the surveillance of the Union 's external borders and our efforts to combat organised crime .
Mr President , tonight 's debate has shown how much still remains to be done in the area of justice and home affairs .
The new Treaty will soon enter into force , providing us with an ambitious goal to work towards , namely to preserve and at the same time to develop Europe as an area of freedom , security and justice .
The combined concepts of freedom , security and justice provide a clear and simple indication of the direction for our future work .
Cooperation should relate to the conditions governing people 's everyday lives .
At the same time , there is the difficulty that so many different spheres of activity are involved .
Our goals therefore have to be tailor-made to fit each individual area of cooperation .
It is a delicate task which I hope will be one of the main topics for debate at the Tampere summit in the autumn .
The Bontempi report makes an important contribution here .
It serves to confirm that we have to become accustomed to thinking of Europe as a common judicial area .
In particular , I welcome the fact that Mr Bontempi , in his report , has stressed the rights of the individual .
The new Treaty brings advantages in a number of different areas .
Schengen , for instance , becomes one of the Union 's areas of cooperation , hopefully making the free movement of persons a complete reality at last for the people of Europe .
Freedom within Europe cannot be reserved exclusively for European citizens .
It must extend to absolutely everyone who lives in or lawfully visits our countries .
This is an important message with potentially far-reaching implications for all future cooperation .
I hope that Parliament takes the same view .
Furthermore , freedom implies more than just being able to move around freely .
Freedom also means being entitled to live in a society where there is effective intervention against those who consider themselves to be above the law .
The European idea therefore continues to be that all the Member States should have confidence in each other 's ability to deal effectively with serious organised crime , for example .
That is largely what Europol is about .
Its mandate is a broad one , and we have created the long-awaited instruments for combating organised crime .
Mr Nassauer , in his report , points out that Europol 's operational powers need to be extended , and quickly .
I agree that in the long term , Europol should be given powers that would make collaboration between police and customs authorities in the Member States as effective as possible .
The Amsterdam Treaty offers precisely this possibility .
Hitherto , it has been a question of Europol exploiting its current mandate to the full .
The organisation 's credibility depends to a large extent on the added value which the police and customs authorities in the Member States see in their cooperation activities .
The benefit derived from Europol stands in direct proportion to the number of crimes solved , in which context it can be said that the support provided by Europol has taken the work forward .
Another issue concerns how the organisation is to be supervised in the future , and in this respect the different Member States have different experiences .
When a new Treaty comes to be drawn up , this aspect should without doubt be one of the main issues .
When we talk about fighting crime , we are also talking about judicial cooperation .
When the work of the police and customs has been completed , it is time for the prosecution services , the lawyers and the courts to play their part and the differences in criminal law in the various Member States then become relevant .
What is regarded as a criminal offence in one country is not necessarily regarded as such in another .
For instance , there are variations in what constitutes organised crime , or in the definition of a child in terms of sexual exploitation .
Moreover , there is not enough cooperation between the courts .
Among numerous examples , fraud is an important area in which the situation has been exploited by those engaged in organised crime .
I therefore agree with Mr Wiebenga that we must find a solution to the problem .
Quite simply , we have to plug all the loopholes that exist .
In my view , we should first of all try to agree on the types of crime that should be regarded as the most serious in all the Member States .
Corruption , trafficking in persons , drugs smuggling , rape , the sexual exploitation of children and terrorism are examples of crimes which should carry uniformly harsh penalties .
In this respect , the Amsterdam Treaty provides a chance to agree at least on a set of minimum rules .
It is also essential that these rules operate in an internationally organised judicial environment .
It is a question of ensuring that our judicial authorities work effectively together , in spite of the differences that exist .
This would make legal systems more genuinely accessible to people , irrespective of which Member State they happen to be in .
The Wiebenga report on criminal procedures ( Corpus Juris ) puts forward a model that would enable the different judicial systems within the European Union to work together more effectively .
Central to the report is the protection of the Community 's financial interests .
The report proposes , amongst other things , a far-reaching harmonisation of criminal law in this area .
It also contains a proposal for the establishment of a European public prosecutor to deal with crimes affecting Community financial interests .
The Corpus Juris model is certainly ambitious , and many would say unrealistic .
For my part , however , I think it is too early to dismiss Corpus Juris .
Instead , we should await the results of the follow-up study .
I agree with the rapporteur that in any event there is good reason to strengthen cooperation between the prosecution services and examining magistrates within the Union .
In the last few months , we have been shocked by the number of instances of child pornography on the Internet .
Boys as well as girls have been subject to exploitation of the most heinous kind .
Our concern for these children should lead us to take forceful action against such crimes .
It is also , however , a question of cleaning up the Internet .
We must as far as possible rid this unique communication and information network of all child pornography .
The Schmid report describes the difficulties involved .
It is not enough simply to increase resources and step up police cooperation .
There also has to be cooperation at a deeper level between the authorities and the information services industry .
What is required is the rapid dissemination of experiences and technical knowledge to enable the child porn homepages to be filtered out .
The joint action put forward in the autumn of 1998 deals precisely with improving this type of cooperation , and stresses in particular the importance of working with the industry and the public authorities .
Furthermore , the Member States agree to review what special requirements the Internet service providers should be obliged to meet .
We should also be seeking to ensure that Community programmes such as STOP and the action plan on Internet abuse are properly used to increase cooperation as part of our common efforts .
I agree with Mr Schmid when he says we could go further .
In the first place , I think that trading in child pornography should be made a criminal offence in all the Member States and that there should be a Union-wide age definition of a ' child ' , although I am aware that this is easier said than done .
At the same time , I also know that there is a sense of justice throughout Europe which demands vigorous action to end all aspects of child exploitation .
The present climate should be highly conducive to moving the boundaries here .
Finally , I should like to say a word about the d 'Ancona report and the battle against drugs .
The Union 's current action plan on drugs comes to an end this year .
The European Council has therefore asked the Commission to prepare a new action plan .
The work was begun during the winter and is now more or less complete .
In spite of the present circumstances , I hope to be able to bring forward the proposal .
In her report , Mrs d 'Ancona places particular emphasis on the importance of preventive measures .
The same aspect is also one of the main themes of the Commission 's proposal .
It is also wholly in keeping with the guidelines approved during the UN 's special session on drugs last summer .
We also attach considerable importance to what we call an integrated and global strategy .
Isolated efforts are not enough , no matter how well executed they are .
Everything that is done in this area must hang together and form a coherent whole .
For instance , the ground must be prepared by preliminary work so that legal action can be taken against drugs-related crime and drug abuse .
A repressive approach should always be accompanied by a strong social commitment .
It is therefore clear that measures adopted at national level should take account of the possible effects which they may have on the global community as a whole .
Drugs-related issues have become a priority .
People also expect clear signals from the Union as to how we plan to meet the challenges that lie ahead of us .
It is therefore vital that there should be a wholehearted commitment on the part of Europe and all its institutions .
I know that Mrs d 'Ancona is also satisfied with the interinstitutional cooperation which has been established during the past year between Parliament , the Commission and the Council in the battle against drugs .
In her report , she also highlights the need for effective cooperation , as well as coordinated measures .
I am wholly in agreement , and I sincerely hope that the cooperation which we have succeeded in establishing will be further developed during the coming years .
Thank you , Commissioner .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Migration , right of asylum and integration of refugees
Mr President , these past few weeks have surely opened the eyes of those who did not understand before .
The tragedy of hundreds of thousands of people being forced to flee Kosovo has clearly shown that migration policy in general - and asylum policy in particular - can no longer be tackled by countries on their own .
Europeans will only be able to confront this serious problem by working together .
However , it is not enough to make erudite and solemn declarations .
These must be backed up by actions and specific political measures .
And that is where the shoe pinches .
As far as the Maastricht Treaty is concerned , which has only been slightly modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam , political initiatives concerning migration and asylum policy are the responsibility of the various governments .
Yet this intergovernmental policy does not work .
More than twenty conventions or joint actions have been adopted but they have yet to be ratified .
They are thus ineffective and of little use .
What is even more serious is that the Council has still not reached any agreement on the text that would have greatly assisted us in the Kosovan crisis , in other words the ' joint action on the temporary protection of persons displaced by conflicts ' .
Politics will not be able to work effectively in Europe if we continue in this way .
With regard to migration and asylum policy , the main obstacle is Europe 's inability to take decisions at Community level with a qualified majority .
I therefore welcome the fact that the Austrian Presidency reopened this debate by presenting a strategic document on the Union 's migration and asylum policy .
It is in the light of this future policy - which we hope will win support at the extraordinary summit in Tampere - that Parliament is setting out its ideas on this issue .
To begin with , we do not want migration and asylum to be confused .
The right to request political asylum is a fundamental right based on the Geneva Convention ; it cannot be violated .
Instead , we must harmonise reception conditions , streamline and speed up the procedures for processing applications , and increase solidarity between the Member States in terms of sharing refugees and the burden imposed by the massive numbers arriving .
Nonetheless , irrespective of what we do , the right to request political asylum is a fundamental human right that cannot under any circumstances be violated .
As regards migration for the purposes of seeking employment , we must support all efforts aimed at ensuring that legal immigrants are fully integrated into our society , to which they make a positive contribution .
However , illegal immigration is a completely different matter and must be combated effectively , particularly where criminal activities are involved .
Illegal immigration networks and trafficking in human beings are new areas where serious organised crime is taking hold .
European countries will only be able to prevent this most inhumane form of crime by pooling the resources they have to combat this phenomenon effectively .
Ladies and gentlemen , the migration and asylum policy is an issue for the future .
If we do not tackle the problem together and propose effective solutions , we may well fail .
The European Parliament does not want to see any such failure .
It is therefore proposing an effective and workable action plan and it expects the governments to take action and put it into practice .
Mr President , Commissioner , my report deals with the ' Eurodac ' system , which is designed to enable us to take the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and to compare them .
The aims are threefold . Firstly , it should put us in a position to combat abuse effectively .
We have established that there is an increasing number of multiple applications .
What is taking place here is social abuse .
We have also established that more and more criminals are applying for asylum in order to avoid the effects of legislation relating to aliens .
What we have also discovered is that more and more illegal immigrants apply for asylum if they are apprehended after entering a country illegally .
The second aim , after combating abuse , is to achieve an indirect sharing of the burden .
It is in line with the Dublin Convention that people who are seeking refuge apply for asylum in the first country they have entered , and these countries are then required to examine the application for asylum .
The third , very important , aim is that the true refugees , the real victims of persecution , must be granted maximum assistance as quickly as possible by ensuring fewer applications for asylum , faster processing of asylum procedures and effective use of the money available for the real asylum seekers .
What led to the drafting of this report ?
The first document was the Eurodac Convention .
As we know , the document was complete and there was agreement in the Council , but it was not signed and as a result of course it has not been ratified .
Despite this we have racked our brains over how to extend the system to include taking the fingerprints of illegal immigrants who are apprehended at the border or in the country , to compare them and to establish whether an application for asylum has already been made ; this would also allow us to effectively implement the Dublin Convention .
The Protocol and the Convention have resulted in Parliament being asked to deliver an opinion in a relatively short period of time , even though they were not ratified and even though it was established in the Council that once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force the Commission and the Council are expecting to come up with a new regulation anyway .
Parliament discussed this in committee and unanimously decided that it should nevertheless deliver an opinion , quite simply so that the Commission could also include Parliament 's ideas in its proposal under the Amsterdam Treaty .
The report which I subsequently presented has been debated twice , and when it was put to the vote on 16 March , the situation changed as a result of a U-turn by the PSE , the Greens and others .
Suddenly a report was no longer needed and the draft was rejected .
As rapporteur , I note the result in committee , even if I do not share its view , since my opinion is what was previously agreed unanimously by the entire committee , namely that Eurodac is necessary to combat current problems .
I should like - not as rapporteur but as a Member of this House and of the Group of the European People 's Party - to make a brief comment about this .
What happened here at the end of the debate was a pathetic spectacle because the Socialist Group and others on the left simply caved in . They were not prepared to send out a signal that asylum abuse must be combated at all costs and that Parliament must exercise its authority to put forward proposals to the Commission that strengthen our position in the areas of asylum applications , the proper processing of applications and combating abuse .
Finally , I would appeal to the common sense of the House to support the Council proposal at tomorrow 's vote and to send out a strong signal in favour of an indirect sharing of the burden and combating abuse .
Mr President , I am speaking as rapporteur and as draftsman of an opinion , but in relation to two different reports .
I would first of all like to talk about the Council 's draft Joint Action on the creation of an early warning system for the transmission of information on illegal immigration and facilitator networks .
In our view , this basically consists of extending to the ' enlargement countries ' the decision taken in 1992 on the creation of the Centre for Information , Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration and concentrating its activities on rapidly detecting cases of supposedly massive immigration .
Parliament criticised the creation of this Centre for Information in 1992 .
It was decided at that stage that CIREFI was to be involved in the issues of illegal immigration and the smuggling of humans .
This proposal requires the ' enlargement countries ' to cooperate where possible . However , in my view , it also raises quite a few doubts , just as the creation of the Centre did at the time .
Firstly , it is difficult to understand why the Commission is not involved in this work , particularly as we approach the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
This new communication also raises doubts in that respect , yet that is not the only thing that leads me to question its effectiveness and its purpose .
First of all , what kind of information do we hope to gather and how do we hope to gather it ?
Are we not aware of what is going on around us ?
I would be surprised if that were the case .
In my view , nothing was as easy to foresee as the humanitarian crisis we are seeing on our television screens ; nothing was as easy to foresee as the crisis that Europe is now experiencing in Kosovo . Equally , few things are as easy to foresee as the fact that in the months ahead , the Straits of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean will once again claim many people who , taking advantage of the good weather , will try to get across in tiny boats and vessels that are in terrible condition .
We do not need warnings to advise us of that .
In any event , we know that illegal immigration causes great concern and Parliament hopes to act responsibly . As I said before , we are surprised at the lack of cooperation with the Commission .
The Commission has the help of Eurostat and in the near future will be able to rely on the Schengen information system or the European information system . In my opinion , these elements would be perfectly adequate and we should not duplicate remits , duties or structures .
Because of all these doubts surrounding the future of this draft action and the Centre itself , I seriously considered rejecting this proposal .
However , as was mentioned earlier , we are aware of the dramatic problems that the illegal trafficking of persons generates in Europe .
We are therefore calling on the Council to put forward a new proposal for a regulation , in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam , within the next year . We are also asking it to include the Mediterranean region and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as an area for action under the scope of this new proposed regulation .
I will now go on to look at the opinion I drew up and the report presented by Mrs Reding on the strategy paper on migration and asylum policy .
I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur very sincerely for her work and her ability to move such a controversial report forward in such a short time .
I am sure all the Members of this House would like to thank her for enabling us to give our opinion on this issue at such an appropriate time and before we complete our work here .
I welcome the Council 's document , particularly as it gives fresh impetus to a fundamental debate within the European institutions and between our institutions and the people of the Union .
On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I would like to point out that our immigration policy and the treatment of ' legal ' immigrants in the European Union are going to become increasingly vital issues in our relations with third countries .
An example of this is the talks we are currently holding with the Mediterranean countries on the conclusion of association agreements .
I therefore believe that we should manage migratory flows not only on the basis of our internal policy , but also by taking account of the Union 's actions in other areas , such as the common foreign policy or our development policies .
In my view , dialogue with third countries , combined with measures aimed at development , is the most important element here . Indeed , such measures involve immigrants as they send a large proportion of their income to their families and this constitutes a significant amount of aid for both the families and the countries themselves .
I must stress that dialogue is more important than joint action and more important than repressive measures or measures imposing our requirements on other countries . Dialogue is essential , a fact which is highlighted in the document .
There were certain elements that I was less satisfied with , and I am speaking now more on behalf of my group than on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs .
Firstly , although we are pleased with this document , we would have been much happier - as I said in relation to the previous issue - if the Council had provided a strong impetus by approving the documents already on the table , which were presented by the Commission in recent months , not to mention years .
I am referring here to the convention for the protection of displaced persons , which was mentioned earlier and which we desperately need .
I am also referring to the convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals .
We would have preferred to receive a clear signal of support and approval for these measure , rather than an analysis of the issues , despite the fact that this in itself is to be welcomed .
As we are seeing , we need an asylum policy and we need an immigration policy .
I would like to take the few moments I have left to ask the Group of the European People 's Party to act in line with the House 's vote on the convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals , and , in relation to the debate initiated here by the Council , to vote in favour of the amendment calling for the rights of third-country nationals residing legally in the Union to be regulated .
To my mind , this issue is of vital importance .
Mr President , as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights my task was to deal with the legal issues raised by the additional protocol to the Eurodac Convention .
The first difficulty here was that we do not know the Council 's reaction to the opinion delivered by the European Parliament on this Convention .
After all , the extensive data protection measures that we called for are at least as important for the additional protocol .
In my opinion the second problem continues to be whether solely illegal entry or solely illegal residence is sufficient to justify such an encroachment on a person 's individual rights .
On this point my view is quite different from that of Mr Pirker , who spoke earlier .
After all , the person 's fingerprints are not just taken and compared but also stored for years to come .
Is this really necessary ?
In any event , the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot decide this because in my view it is a moral question .
On the whole , it must be said that the Council has made significant efforts to draft a text that guarantees that stored fingerprints should be used to enforce the Dublin Convention , although in my opinion it has not gone far enough .
We must clearly vote against an extension of the Eurodac database , as called for by the rapporteur .
That is why we voted against it in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and spoke out against the adoption of this report .
We did not ' cave in ' , as the rapporteur said ; however , we did express our opinion that we are not convinced that we can just treat people in this way .
In my view a Europe in which all the data relating to a particular person can be retrieved at any time is not our Europe , nor does it correspond to my vision of Europe .
Mr President , I have three comments to make on the reports on asylum policy which feature on our agenda for the plenary this evening .
Firstly , in recent years the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has highlighted time and time again the need for a harmonised approach to matters of asylum and migration .
Resolutions were drawn up by Mr Wiebenga , by myself and by Mrs Lindeperg prior to the reports on our agenda now by Anna TerrÃ³n , Mrs Zimmermann , Mr Pirker and Mrs Reding .
Mrs Reding 's report is a really good one , if I may say so .
The European Parliament also decided last year to set up a fund for refugees .
In stark contrast to that , and this is my second point , we see the inability of the Council to be effective : inability to agree on how to admit refugees at the appropriate time and how to share the burdens ; inability to agree a definition of what constitutes a refugee ; inability to set up a common fund to pay for the reception , integration or return of those whose cases have been processed .
It beggars belief that even in the terrible circumstances we are witnessing today , there is no will to work together .
This brings me to my third point , which is really a question .
How can it be that the Council is working on a kind of negative accompanying policy which seems to suggest that harmonisation does in fact exist ?
Asylum seekers are not allowed to apply for asylum in more than one Member State , it was decided in Dublin .
Hence a system called Eurodac , which enables this to be verified using asylum seekers ' fingerprints .
Parliament produced a consultation paper on this with a great deal of difficulty , because we really thought that it went much too far .
But the Council 's intention to extend this system to illegals really is too much .
We do not want police state operations , and nor do we want attacks of this kind on people 's physical integrity .
And I agree with what Mrs Zimmermann has already said .
We want just one thing : an approach to European asylum policy which is at all times fast , efficient and humane .
It is unfortunate that there are perforce no Commission initiatives in this area at present .
I believe , and I wish to make the point , that Commissioner Gradin has done an extremely good job here .
We are feeling the lack of a president because the Council is taking its time in putting together a new Commission , and I have to say that in this regard there is just one thing we need , namely a decision by the Council so that the matter can be addressed properly at last .
Mr President , in this joint debate , the Community action programme to promote the integration of refugees - for which Mrs Zimmermann is rapporteur - has assumed particular importance in view of the current situation .
The European Parliament had the foresight in 1997 to create a number of new lines in the budget which give the European Union the scope to implement specific measures in this area .
It is important to highlight the fact that the action plan will help us to coordinate Community initiatives and those of the Member States .
In my view , this coordination is vital for the successful development of the action plan and we must therefore ensure that the various administrations involved collaborate in a clear and effective manner .
The way the Commission has organised the pilot projects carried out in the last two years has not been particularly satisfactory , since the Member States have not been properly informed about the development of the projects and nothing has been done to help them to participate .
Therefore , Commissioner , we must rectify these mistakes and try to make the most of the results of the measures taken earlier .
In this respect , it might be useful to assess the results achieved through the earlier projects with a view to preventing any similar mistakes in the future .
Moreover , given that the programme also aims to promote transnational cooperation , raise public awareness , and so on , it is important when trying to make the most of future actions to take other EU initiatives into account , such as those that come under the European Social Fund , the action plan to combat racism , or other programmes such as ' Youth for Europe ' , which could also have repercussions on issues concerning refugees .
We will thus be able to avoid a duplication and therefore dilution of any efforts made .
As regards the joint action on voluntary repatriation , it is important to ensure that the aid is not used for this purpose alone , but is also used to improve the refugee reception centres in the Member States . In addition to improving the buildings , we must also allocate funds to train those working in the centres so that they can properly receive the refugees and provide them with the help they need for their future integration .
On another matter , and without going into an in-depth analysis of the legal basis for the approval of the action plan - Article 235 - I simply want to point out that it might possibly have been better to wait until the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force and to adopt these measures under the framework of Community action to promote social integration , in accordance with the new Article 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Nevertheless , Mr President , Commissioner , we are very much in favour of the adoption of these proposals and we hope that they can be implemented as soon as possible .
Mr President , this debate is overshadowed by the war in Kosovo .
For two years , the European Parliament and the Commission had been pressing the Council of Ministers for decisions on how to cope with refugees and how the financial burden should be shared in the event of major human disasters of the kind now happening in Kosovo .
The European Union ought to have learned from its experience with the half a million refugees from Bosnia .
The relevant legislative proposal , a form of joint action , was accepted last year by the European Parliament , but the Council of Ministers has done nothing about it .
We have no system for the acceptance of refugees , although we do have a very small refugee fund of EUR 15 million or so .
But on the other hand , virtually no financial provision has been made for emergency aid .
All this is a sorry state of affairs .
Last week 's decision of the Council of Justice Ministers about what to do with displaced persons from Kosovo said essentially that they should be taken in , in other words accepted in the Balkan region .
That is in itself a good decision .
I refer you , for example , to paragraph 26 of Mrs Reding 's excellent report .
We must endeavour to make it possible for these people to go back to Kosovo as soon as possible , to their own homes , because ethnic cleansing cannot be accepted as a fait accompli .
The Austrian Presidency 's strategy paper is a good starting-point for a new European policy on migration and asylum .
But it should be the last paper .
What we need now is legislation .
Mrs d 'Ancona has said this already .
The previous paper , and it was not a Council one but a European Commission one - Commissioner Flynn issued it in 1994 - was virtually ignored .
The debates on it , if I can mention merely one example , talked of the migration monitoring centre .
This was a monitoring centre , a unit of the European Union , which was to have the remit of monitoring conditions in refugees ' countries of origin .
Nothing has come of it .
And now , and I am looking here at Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ 's report , we are talking about an early warning system for illegal immigration , controlled by the Council of Ministers .
That is not a good idea , because a monitoring centre for migration of the kind discussed earlier ought to come under the responsibility of the Commission , and should have a broader remit .
We need a European policy on asylum for the future , and we need it fast .
The Tampere summit will be too late to help the Kosovars .
But the Heads of Government should seize the chance to break the years of deadlock over the devising of a policy such as this , a uniform European policy on asylum , just as they did last year over monetary policy and as they did recently in Berlin over financial policy .
Mr President , it is difficult not to be shocked and moved by the flood of Kosovar refugees fleeing the barbaric acts of the Serbian militias .
Yet it is also difficult to ignore the hesitation and ambiguity of the Member States about accepting these refugees and their catastrophic inability to predict these obvious expulsions .
They are hesitant to commit and share out the funds needed to accept the refugees , yet the high cost of the weapons used has never been challenged . They are ambiguous about the status of these refugees since certain Member States are only proposing to grant them territorial asylum with reduced rights , rather than strictly applying the Geneva Convention .
Such ambiguity is also evident in the presidency 's strategic document on immigration and asylum .
The initial document from the Austrian Presidency created such an outcry that the German Presidency modified it .
It clearly removed or watered down the most controversial aspects , but retained its fundamental approach , emphasising repressive action as well as the methods of preventing migratory flows into the European Union .
Unfortunately , this document sticks very closely to the policy that is currently being followed in many Member States , a policy that is increasingly restrictive and repressive towards immigrants .
The immigration policy is considered first of all from a security viewpoint , with the construction of what amounts to a judicial and police barricade prohibiting access to the European area .
Immigration is all too often wrongly linked to the rise in unemployment , a notion that has unfortunately been repeated here in the House .
During a recent debate on a draft convention from the Commission , this House justified applying the Community preference - which is terrible in itself - and national preference in the field of employment .
My group strongly condemns such moves and also opposes quotas on immigration .
These quotas are based on neocolonial attitudes and their only aim is to select immigrants according to the European economy 's needs , both intellectually and in terms of manpower .
I will continue to stress , here and elsewhere , that there is no correlation between immigration and the rate of unemployment , and studies by the OECD have demonstrated this .
We must put an end to this strategy of finding scapegoats and rid ourselves of our obsession with security .
The process of regulating the status of illegal immigrants that is applied in certain Member States does exactly the opposite of this strategy , but we must not stop there .
That is why my group is proposing in an amendment that the Member States should regulate the status of illegal immigrants , while respecting human rights and the relevant international conventions .
I would call on our governments to ratify and implement all the international conventions , particularly the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families and the 1992 Council of Europe Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level .
The provisions of these conventions should be included in the future Community policy on immigration and asylum provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam , instead of this arsenal of administrative controls that simply increase in the number of files to be dealt with .
In recent times , the right of asylum has become more and more restricted .
In fact , in France , in 1997 , 83 % of applications for asylum were rejected . These included applications from Algerian victims of terrorism and from Kurds who were the victims of oppression that was as severe as that now experienced by the people of Kosovo .
The presidency 's strategic document does nothing to alter this trend .
Along with other Members of this House , I have therefore signed the appeal backed by the High Commissioner for Refugees stating that it is unacceptable to allow Europe to enjoy the benefits of its economic and financial environment yet ignore the distress beyond its borders .
In conclusion , I would like to mention the analysis by the president of the European Union Migrants Forum , as it is also an appeal to all elected representatives and governments .
In his view , those seeking asylum , refugees and migrants all form part of European society both now and in the future .
Treating them as possible aggressors to be discouraged from approaching our prosperous Europe means that only the well-off will be allowed into this very private club .
And as far as the poor are concerned , be they nationals or those from other countries who have already arrived , all they have to do is wait and their turn will come .
Indeed , in his opinion , they will soon be looked on more as intruders who should not have any rights and who deserve only hand-outs .
Our struggle is therefore a struggle on behalf of our entire democratic society .
We are not only fighting for ourselves and for all those who have had the misfortune to be born with the wrong papers ; we are also fighting to strengthen the democratic foundations of our societies .
Mr President , this report takes on an even wider significance following the tragic events in Yugoslavia and Kosovo , right in the heart of Europe .
I wish to refer in particular to the proposals on the fingerprinting of illegal immigrants .
This is the thin edge of the wedge .
It is Orwellian in its theory and probably , if it is ever put into practice , something even George Orwell would not have thought of .
Instead of tattooing them , the modern-day Europe is going to identify those who make us feel uncomfortable by fingerprinting .
After immigrants , we take on the gypsies , then citizens we do not like the look of .
Immigrants and those we feel uncomfortable with in society are branded , as criminals are today .
I strongly oppose this proposal .
I admit there is no easy solution .
If there was , it would have been found by now .
Issues of high politics are caught up in issues of human rights .
There is an overwhelming and immediate need to protect and care for the victims of war , to stop the genocide and to find a solution acceptable to all sides , including respect for and understanding of the needs of neighbouring countries .
Top priority continues to be the need to protect and to care for the refugees .
Families have been separated and sent to different countries .
Refugees have died in holding pens in modern-day Europe , without sanitation or proper services .
The UNHCR has been very slow to react , to say the very least .
We have to act , as the interior ministers did last week , when they suggested that long-term admission of Kosovars to countries outside the region would consolidate their displacement from their homes .
We have to be certain that the wrong signals are not sent to the Serbian regime , that it is possible for the Kosovars to return home eventually to safety .
We welcomed the launching of the general debate last year on a consistent approach to the questions of migration and asylum .
The strategy paper , which has been under consideration in the Council , has enabled a serious analysis of the many aspects of migration and asylum to be undertaken so that constructive solutions can be found .
In the light of the present crisis we also welcome the fact that the strategy paper developed last year examined the possibility of making a single member of the Commission responsible for all matters relating to migration policy .
This could be a significant advance given that at present several members of the outgoing Commission are responsible for different areas , which range from the legal aspects of migration , humanitarian aid and the free movement of persons to the foreign policy aspects of migration .
A number of the points set out in today 's reports overlap as , for example , the services and reception facilities to be provided for asylum seekers and refugees .
Finally , I wish to pay tribute to the Commissioner .
It may be my last opportunity to do so publicly .
She has been a great asset to the Community and a great source of support on issues that have very often been discussed in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs .
I wish to pay tribute to Mrs Gradin and wish her every success , whether she comes back or not .
Mr President , my group supports the reports by Mrs Zimmermann and Mrs Reding .
Even in the last few days it has become clear once again how urgently we need a European policy on refugees and immigration .
The atrocities , the expulsion and the genocide in Kosovo and the sometimes unpleasant way in which some Member States are dealing with the displaced persons who need our support illustrate once again that we need a harmonised policy on refugees and asylum , but one that must be humane in accordance with the Geneva Convention .
The harmonised minimum level for certain services and reception facilities must apply to all EU Member States .
We cannot have a situation in which some countries , like my country , Germany , bear a far heavier burden than others .
This also applies to the area of migrant labour .
Mrs Reding 's report contains some very welcome demands for a differentiated approach involving three groups : refugees , migrant labour and the victims of smuggling networks .
I would like to thank Mrs Reding on behalf of my group for presenting such a differentiated report .
With regard to what Mr Pirker said , it is not true that we did not or do not want a report on Eurodac .
We wanted a report but not the one that Mr Pirker has given us .
We would have liked to have discussed and adopted a critical report , which is what our voters elected us to do and expect of us .
When it comes to civil rights and avoiding the same old arguments we have a huge responsibility , even here in the House .
That is why we rejected his report : because it was not appropriate for this House .
Mr President , the report by Mrs Reding is both courageous and intelligent and I am pleased to pay tribute to her today .
I must point out that it follows on from the strategic document presented by the Austrian Presidency .
This initially led to some controversy but it also opened a debate that has proved to be quite fruitful .
The report analyses four key problems .
The first relates to the right of asylum , its unique characteristics and all the other rights that correspond to it .
The second involves immigrant labour and the mobility of the labour force .
The third point highlights the problem of the illegal immigration networks , whilst the fourth deals with the statute for legal immigrants .
Until now , a certain vagueness surrounded all these concepts , a sense of confusion , which , helped along by ideology - even passion - and demagogy , led to very serious problems .
I need look no further for proof of this than the words of our colleague Mr Pirker , who just accused the left of caving in to its own supporters .
I must point out to him that the immigrant supporters are not necessarily the best we can find .
Secondly , as far as the right of asylum is concerned , it is important to stress that everyone has the right to request asylum and that the Geneva Conventions - the conventions themselves and the additional protocols - which are the founding texts , represent a frame of reference that cannot be violated .
We need to think very carefully about the proposed replacements , which the report very clearly rejects .
The report also stresses that there should be minimum standards for the services and reception facilities to which asylum seekers are entitled . It highlights , too , that we need to respect the conventions , speed up procedures and , above all , guarantee the rights of those seeking asylum until a final decision has been taken by the judicial authorities to proceed with deportation .
Finally , we should pay tribute to the genuine efforts being made to reconcile the judicial proceedings and regulations involved with the human dimension .
After the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Commission will be able to take legislative initiatives .
If the Commission continues along the same path it has followed until now - and perhaps we should pay tribute to the Commission today , particularly as we do not do so very often at the moment - it should be aware that it will find in Parliament , be it this Parliament or its successor , a reliable and faithful ally .
Mr President , Parliament previously expressed its support for the Eurodac Convention .
We were told at the time that it was designed to make it easier to apply the Dublin Convention by offering security both to those seeking asylum , who would be assured that they could apply for asylum in a Member State , and also to the countries themselves , since the system enabled us to prevent multiple applications .
However , the reasons given by the Council today , to which the rapporteur has just given his support , for extending Eurodac to include certain categories of illegal immigrants through a protocol are far from convincing . We feel that the risk of abuse here is quite considerable .
Our group therefore hopes that the protocol will be rejected , just as the entire committee hoped that it would be rejected .
Unfortunately , I do not have time to talk about the excellent reports by Mrs TerrÃ³n and Mrs Zimmermann , but I would like to take a moment to look at the report by Mrs Reding .
I must congratulate her because , although dealing with a very sensitive and controversial subject , she has succeeded in finding compromises on most issues and they are likely to be supported by the vast majority here . At the same time , she has also managed to maintain the fundamental points and principles that I and my group fully supported and that she herself has just explained very clearly .
We were somewhat concerned about certain aspects of the strategic document presented by the Austrian Presidency and , in our view , it was vital that the report should set out these concerns very clearly .
The first of these relates to the necessary distinction between the problem of asylum and that of immigration .
The implications of this are very important , particularly as regards access to the territory of Europe and , thus , access to the procedure put in place for the many people applying for asylum who , for reasons that are very easy to understand , do not have the relevant documents .
We must not liken these people to illegal immigrants ; that would be like riding roughshod over the principle that asylum seekers should not be expelled or returned .
I am also pleased that the report is very clear on the fact that we must ensure the full and complete application of the Geneva Convention and refuse to accept any attempt to renegotiate it .
The gaps in the Convention need to be filled , particularly through the creation of a statute on complementary protection , but under no circumstances must we replace the Convention itself . Furthermore , we strongly oppose a policy based on an ' institutional offer ' at the discretion of each Member State .
Another important point is our request for a broad interpretation of the Geneva Convention , particularly as regards taking account of persecution by third parties .
Parliament has often expressed its view on this issue , yet there has not been the slightest shift in the Council 's position or in the measures taken by the Member States .
Finally , the tragic events we are currently witnessing prove that it was vital to express our disapproval of the fact that the joint actions proposed by the Commission on the temporary protection of displaced persons have been blocked in the Council , and many of the speakers here have mentioned this .
Commissioner Gradin had hoped to learn from the experience of the Bosnian tragedy , and quite rightly so .
Unfortunately , the Council 's procrastination has meant that the system she is proposing cannot be implemented to help tackle the tragedy in Kosovo , and this does Europe no credit .
Although the refugees from Kosovo are apparently covered by the Geneva Convention , such massive immigration flows clearly prevent us from considering each case individually in a short period of time and using the normal processes . Temporary protection would undoubtedly be the appropriate instrument in such cases , but without permanently ruling out the possibility of invoking the Geneva Convention .
I therefore welcome the report by Mrs Reding . However , I would point out that , despite its merits , we are unfortunately left to wonder how effective it will be , as until now the Council has not paid a great deal of attention to the very many consistent recommendations Parliament has made .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is increasingly apparent that the Austrian strategy paper on asylum and immigration in Europe has become the basis for an extremely productive and , above all , necessary discussion .
It is necessary because asylum and immigration will be communitised with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Even if they are dependent on unanimous Council decisions for the next five years , they will still be removed from the jurisdiction of the Member States and transferred to the Community .
This means that in the areas of asylum and immigration we must force ourselves to think in Community terms , and that is the task of this Parliament .
I would like to focus on one point here .
I believe that we in Europe and here in the European Parliament must answer one question very clearly , a question that is fundamental to this whole discussion : generally speaking , do we in Europe want to take in immigrants or not ?
And here I am not talking about political refugees .
There is absolutely no question that these are to be taken in , a point which cannot seriously be disputed by anyone .
I am not talking either about civil war refugees , other quota refugees or family reunification .
I am discussing only the basic issue of whether we in Europe wish to take in immigrants , as we are occasionally asked to do .
Here I would say , ladies and gentlemen , that Europe is not an immigration area like the United States was in the last century and possibly still is today , or like Australia , New Zealand , Canada or any other countries which desperately sought people to fill up their space .
We are not in that situation : on the contrary , we have 20 million unemployed .
As a result of this we have no choice but to restrict immigration .
I would like to emphasise once again that I am not talking about asylum and related issues but only about immigration , and particularly illegal immigration .
In my view it is irresponsible to reject the Eurodac Convention when we consider that 80 % of illegal immigrants are victims of trafficking networks that cynically exploit the misery and suffering of these people .
One of the things that is needed in order to put a stop to their activities is the signing of the Eurodac Convention .
Those who reject is are playing straight into the hands of the smuggling networks by voting against it .
Please consider this .
On the subject of asylum we are essentially in agreement .
Everyone here is in favour of granting asylum to the victims of political persecution .
We now need to settle the matter of the procedure .
Should all asylum seekers in Europe have an individual procedure or must we resign ourselves to considering institutional guarantees ?
I believe that speedy processing is particularly in the interest of applicants for asylum .
For this reason we must open up this second possibility .
Mr President , Commissioner , I took great pleasure in listening to Mrs Reding presenting her report .
I must say that there is nothing I would have put differently , especially when I have in my hand two pages of conclusions reached during the meeting of justice and foreign affairs ministers in Luxembourg last week .
One might ask oneself whether this is really the outcome of a conference attended by 15 ministers : an expression of thanks to Albania and a statement to the effect that we are prepared to provide protection for refugees from the Kosovo region .
Is this the level of solidarity we are able to display in Europe ?
We are capable of action when 2 000 Kurds are knocking at our doors , but not when hundreds of thousands of people are suffering .
We have a collective responsibility for the tens of thousands of people who have vanished and for those who will probably die of starvation .
It is now up to all those countries that have talked about a European identity and the importance of solidarity to do something in the present situation .
I also have to say that today I am ashamed of being Finnish .
We have a prime minister who might very well not have seen on television over Easter or even be aware of the anxiety and suffering in Kosovo .
I apologise for being Finnish , but I am nevertheless pleased that our government has at last done something , since that is what people want .
Our solidarity is being put to the test .
We must hold our ground in the European Parliament .
In particular , we must stand firm over the proposal relating to a European fund for refugees and for increased Community resources directed at those in need .
Mr President , so far the EU 's policy on refugees has consisted solely of restrictive measures .
The Dublin Convention and Eurodac should also be viewed in the same light .
In practical terms , moreover , the Schengen Agreement has played a major role in generally making it more difficult for asylum seekers to persuade the EU authorities to look into their reasons for requesting asylum .
EU policy bears the stamp of repression and police involvement , which in turn explains - or very largely explains - the growing influx of illegal immigrants and refugees .
What is required instead is , above all , a shared responsibility throughout the whole of Europe , and not just in the EU , for those who need protection .
We also need rules based on the UN Convention on the status of refugees to ensure that they are well treated .
In addition , there should be a means of guaranteeing the rights of those who are legally resident within the EU , for example their right to be able to move around freely within the Union .
Eurodac is central to the system devised under the Dublin Convention for applying the principle of the first country of asylum .
This principle has numerous shortcomings , as does Eurodac itself .
The principle of the first country of asylum is currently being applied , in spite of the fact that the Member States acknowledge that differences exist between asylum seekers .
The principle is irrational and may well lead to arbitrary decisions being made .
Secondly , there is also an obvious danger of the Eurodac register expanding and being abused .
And thirdly , fingerprinting infringes the integrity of the person and should only be done where it is genuinely necessary .
Today 's proposal on Eurodac should therefore be rejected in its present form .
I should also like to say a few words about the Reding report concerning the strategy paper on migration and asylum policy .
Last year , the Austrian Presidency put forward an exceptionally cynical proposal regarding the EU 's future asylum policy .
It constituted what amounts to a frontal attack on the foundations of a humane asylum policy .
Consequently , I welcome the fact that , on a number of important points , Mrs Reding disagrees with the proposal , particularly in her defence of the Geneva Convention and the role of the UNHCR .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the increasingly restrictive measures that we have been discussing and unfortunately adopting for years are always claimed by the Right in this House not to be restricting refugee policy but merely combating abuse .
It was against this background that we created a regulation concerning third countries which is clearly contrary to the Geneva Convention but also does not do anything to combat abuse .
It was against this background that we removed persecution by non-state violence from the grounds for recognising refugee status .
It was against this background that the Austrian Presidency 's strategy paper on refugees ultimately came into being , which represents a clear attack on the Geneva Convention .
But even if these Members really were only concerned with abuse and not , as Mr Nassauer said , with the actual refugees , then today we have come to the moment of truth , Mr Pirker , Mr Nassauer : today 200 000 people are fleeing Kosovo , and they are being denied refugee status in violation of the Geneva Convention .


Why do you not stand up and demand that the Geneva Convention , which clearly provides protection for people who are persecuted for ethnic reasons , be observed ?
Then stand up and demand that the Geneva Convention be observed and that these people be granted refugee status !
Mr President , I too must compliment Viviane Reding on a particularly humane and balanced report , but I am sure she will not take it amiss if I say here that it is particularly cynical for the European Parliament to be discussing today a strategy paper from the presidency on asylum and migration policy , at a time when hundreds of thousands of people are being driven out of Kosovo , deported , are stuck in the mud in refugee camps , locked up even , or being driven back into Kosovo .
It is cynical to be talking of a strategy which should result in a common approach of the Union at the autumn summit in Tampere , when the Council meeting in Luxembourg could not even agree a joint strategy for the admission of refugees in one of the biggest humanitarian disasters which Europe has even seen .
I find it shameful that the European Union , which is wealthy and prosperous , merely salves its conscience by giving a few tens of millions of euros in aid to the region .
In all honesty , Commissioner , I cannot understand either the stance expressed by Mrs Bonino on behalf of the Commission that she was against settling refugees in the European Union .
Of course it is good to keep people in their own area , always provided it can be done in decent conditions .
But the television pictures and the reports from humanitarian organisations have shown us clearly that this is not possible , that the countries bordering on Kosovo are , moreover , too poor and too unstable to be able to cope with this influx appropriately .
The political reluctance shown by some Member States of the Union is disgraceful too .
Nevertheless , this strategy document says quite clearly that the European Commission 's proposals for acceptance of refugees , which have been on the table for two years already , as Mr Wiebenga rightly pointed out , must be approved as speedily as possible .
So I think this debate should prompt us to urge the Council once again - and forcefully - to conclude an agreement without delay on collective action on refugees and on a statute giving them guaranteed rights and protection .
If the 15 cannot manage this , Commissioner , I am convinced that those Member States which do wish to cooperate will have to conclude an agreement on how to deal with refugees - a kind of humanitarian Schengen , if I can call it that .
I am not at all pro-Schengen , but in this case it seems to me to be absolutely the right course .
Finally , I should like to raise another point which is terribly important both in Mrs Reding 's report and in the crisis in Kosovo .
I refer to the reuniting of families .
Every day on television we see the tragedy of families which have become separated , of children , men and women who cannot find each other .
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives everyone the right to live in a family .
That right must be upheld for refugees and displaced persons too .
That right must be guaranteed by the Union for refugees from Kosovo and for any other asylum seeker or refugee .
I think we urgently need to revise and add to the Dublin agreement on this point .
The yawning gap which divides the few good proposals contained in the strategy paper and European dithering in this area - I have no other word for it - shows that it will really take a miracle if we are to achieve anything specific at Tampere .
I hope the Commission will show perseverance and I hope Parliament will continue to be involved in preparing policy , because the Council gives the impression of having to protect Europe against the refugees , rather than wanting to protect the refugees themselves .
Mr President , Viviane Reding has drawn up an excellent report and we must point out that she was particularly sensitive with those of us who participated in the debate and very receptive to all our contributions .
When talking about immigration , in my view , there are two key elements : solidarity and the human dimension of the problem .
Solidarity is important because every human being , irrespective of nationality , sex or religion , has the right to a decent life and to sufficient resources to enable him to survive .
We cannot understand immigration if we are only concerned about our own borders , our own welfare or our own geostrategic interests .
The human dimension also requires considerable efforts on the part of the Member States if it is to be reconciled with the legislation needed to regulate the entry and exit of third-country nationals or a period of residence in our countries by those who are seeking work , refuge or asylum from persecution in their own countries . We must finally introduce a common policy to regulate the administrative and judicial procedures involved .
This policy must allow us to pursue and sentence those who exploit human beings . It must also help us to ensure that the most fundamental rights of any immigrants in our countries , be they legal or illegal , will be respected , even in instances where they have to be expelled or returned to their country of origin .
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not only the responsibility of the European Union .
It is also up to the countries from which the immigrants come to strive to make the most of the human and material resources they have available , that is , both their own resources and those provided by the European Union in the form of assistance . They must also become more democratic and guarantee respect for their citizens ' rights .
Mr President , first let me congratulate the four rapporteurs involved in this joint debate on migration , asylum and refugees : Mrs Zimmermann , Mrs TerrÃ³n i Cusi , Mrs Reding and Mr Pirker .
It is impossible for me in three minutes to discuss adequately the details of these four complex reports , ranging from early warning systems for illegal immigration to integration of refugees , from migration policy to fingerprinting applicants for asylum .
Instead I will try to touch on a number of principles which I believe should be the basis for the policy that we pursue in all of these areas .
First let me say that the European Union must have the ability to make choices as to the immigration policy it wishes to pursue .
With a borderless Europe these choices can only be made together , rather than separately .
Our current policy limits immigration to a few cases of family reunion , plus some German and Greeks from the former Soviet Union who are entering their own countries .
Provided that , in the future , such policies are arrived at in a non-racist way , by open and democratic debate , then I can support them .
Secondly , we need to make it clear that asylum seekers and refugees are not immigrants .
Sometimes this is an issue that is confused .
Our responsibility with regard to their applications for asylum or for refugee status go further than with respect to immigration .
It is inhuman for us to send people back to face torture , physical abuse and death .
Of course some individuals will try to abuse the system - just like Members of the European Parliament ! - I do not see that refugees and asylum seekers are any different .
I have no problem , therefore , in supporting measures to prevent multiple applications .
My problem is a different one : I will not repeat my colleagues ' comments , particularly those from the Socialist Group , on what is happening in Kosovo but I will reiterate a point I made in an earlier debate .
Some years ago Member States of the European Union were refusing applications for asylum from those courageous individuals in Serbia who had refused to be conscripted to join in ethnic cleansing .
That crime may well have contributed to the larger crimes being carried out against the Kosovo Albanians while we speak .
The refusal rate is not a measure of need , but a measure of failure of will and courage by Member States who are refusing to recognise that the level of valid applications may well be substantially above the level of those currently granted either permanent or temporary leave to remain .
Thirdly and finally , within the Union we have four million black Europeans and 12 to 14 million third country nationals .
We have a responsibility to ensure not only that all citizens have the same rights and same duties within the European Union but so do all residents .
It is only then that we can build the kind of Europe that I would like to see .
Mr President , it is not easy to round off this debate as the most important issues have already been discussed repeatedly .
In the previous debate , I said that we are at a stage where European public opinion is very much aware that it wants Europe to be more than just a market ; it wants Europe to be a project for civilization .
And the best way of seeing exactly what we want Europe to be is by looking at how we present ourselves , how we present our internal environment to those who knock on our door , be they immigrants , those seeking asylum or refuge , or displaced persons .
That is why today 's reports are so important .
I would like to stress one aspect that has already been mentioned , but that , in my view , has perhaps not received the attention it deserves , namely , the legal framework .
Parliament often tends to be proactive here .
I believe that the legal framework is our safeguard and our responsibility .
It represents the defence of the weakest , in other words those who , in this case , are seeking asylum .
It is Parliament 's responsibility to defend it as far as possible .
As I said before , we must interpret the Treaty of Amsterdam as broadly and as boldly as we can , yet we must not go beyond its framework . If that is not sufficient , then we must hold an intergovernmental conference to revise the Treaty .
What we do not want to see in this process of European integration that we all desire is a violation of the Treaty , through the back door and by means of concrete measures .
Two specific questions remain in relation to the reports .
As far as the Eurodac report is concerned , we are now waiting to see what approach the Commission regulation takes under the new legal bases . We must also recognise that at this stage the political focus of the document is incomplete .
It does not contain all of Parliament 's beliefs and wishes , nor , I am sure , does it include all that the Commission hopes for .
This must be resolved so that it does not appear as if this is our position on Eurodac .
As regards Mrs Reding 's report , which is very important , extremely interesting and comprehensive , I would merely like to take these last 30 seconds to highlight the issue of respect for the legal framework , which I have already mentioned .
Mrs Reding has reached an interesting compromise between our desire to stretch the Treaty to its limits and ensuring that we do not go too far and allow it to snap .
Mr President , I find the debate unrealistic and rather hypocritical .
What is real is the challenge presented by hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo .
What is real , Madam Commissioner , is the scandalous meeting held by the Council of Ministers , at which it recently decided not to bear the costs of relieving the refugees ' suffering , and to place the burden on neighbouring countries . However , these countries are unable to assume this burden , either economically , politically or socially .
The destabilisation of these countries is beginning to unfold , and when this happens the Council and , I imagine , the Commission too , will not have the legal basis to help there either .
They told us hypocritically that they want the refugees to stay in the area , so as not to send the wrong political message to Mr Milosevic .
Just hark at that !
In other words , the messages sent by the missiles and the bombs are not enough ?
Will the refugees become messages too ?
Shame !
Or are our leaders anticipating a swift solution to the crisis ? Judging by the credibility of their forecasts thus far ...
What can I say ! Dark vistas are opening up for the refugees and for the neighbouring countries !
This debate , Madam Commissioner , could become less unrealistic if both Parliament and the Commission found a way to call on the Council urgently on whatever legal basis to immediately re-examine its position , which is unacceptable and befitting of Pontius Pilate .
As for the rest , dealing with this at intergovernmental level and within the Community , and all the things that have been quite correctly said here , we can examine them in the future .
The present is here and it is posing a multitude of threats .
Mr President , one of last year 's most important initiatives was the Austrian proposal concerning immigration and asylum policy , which triggered a much-needed debate both in the Council of Ministers and in this House .
Mrs Reding also attaches great importance to the initiative in her report .
I share her view that immigration and asylum should be treated as separate issues and , furthermore , this was one of the aspects I raised when the Austrian Presidency submitted its first draft .
I also agree with the rapporteur that immigration should not be regarded as a problem ; it can be an asset , and is a natural part of the life of the international community .
It is something we must learn to understand , accept and deal with .
At the present time , the rules on immigration vary from one country to another .
The Commission has therefore submitted a proposal for closer approximation of the rules .
Amongst other things , we have raised the issue of the fundamental rights of immigrants , particularly as regards their access to the European labour market .
Naturally , I am hoping for strong support from the Council of Ministers , as well as from Parliament .
For my own part , the situation of immigrants in the community is the most crucial element .
As Mr Ford has said , this concerns the living conditions of some ten million people who have been residing legally in our Member States for many years .
Some clear political signals are therefore required .
In addition , the battle against illegal immigration must be stepped up .
So long as immigration is subject to regulation , people will try to circumvent the mechanisms of control .
This has led to the existence of a large-scale market in the smuggling of human beings .
It also lies behind the proposal for a system for rapidly exchanging information on illegal immigration , which Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ deals with in her report .
I regard this proposal as an important part of our efforts to effectively tackle the cynical practice of trafficking in women for sexual purposes which is taking place throughout Europe .
It is especially important that such a system should also include all the Central and Eastern European countries .
During the past year , we have seen far too many women from those countries , who are being exploited in this way , on the streets and in the brothels of our capital cities .
Ever since I first arrived in Brussels , I have been striving to get this issue onto the EU 's agenda .
The problem is that we have only a limited knowledge of the details of people smuggling , and in particular of what is actually taking place in the countries of origin .
A system for exchanging information such as that described in the resolution would represent a considerable step forward .
We need to be able to find out more quickly , for example , when new illegal smuggling organisations are discovered in the countries of origin .
Our knowledge of smuggling tactics and methods , as well as the routes used , also needs to be improved .
From the report , it is clear that Mrs TerrÃ³n i CusÃ­ would prefer the Commission to be responsible for managing an information system of this kind .
I appreciate her confidence .
The Commission 's role in the area of migration policy will be increased in the next few years with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty .
In the short term , however , it is essential to ensure that the work continues as quickly as possible .
The 1951 Geneva Convention provides a sound basis for a common refugee policy .
At the same time , the convention will soon be celebrating its half century .
The world has changed in the intervening years , and the refugee situation with it .
Many of those who need protection today do not fulfil the criteria established during the cold war era .
Moreover , we are increasingly being confronted by refugee crises on a massive scale which flare up quickly .
Other , supplementary instruments are therefore now required .
The need for protection should always take precedence over formal rules .
The refugee crisis which we are now witnessing in Kosovo is merely the latest tragic example .
On countless occasions during the past four and a half years , I have called in vain for Europe to equip itself with new asylum instruments to supplement the Geneva Convention in precisely this kind of situation .
Moreover , I have launched several initiatives to bring such instruments into existence : one on temporary protection , another on burden sharing , and a third that would increase the effectiveness of the asylum process .
I appreciate the support which I have had from this House for the last initiative .
On the other hand , the Council of Ministers withdrew its support when the members saw its actual implications .
Nor have we made much progress on temporary shelter or burden sharing .
I am convinced that Europe will continue to shoulder its responsibilities as regards the crisis in Kosovo .
Last week 's special ministerial meeting also gave a clear indication in this respect .
Already , a massive effort is under way to help the whole region to cope with the hundreds of thousands of refugees who now find themselves in Albania , FYROM and Montenegro .
Moreover , further help is on the way , both from the Member States and the Commission .
The Member States have also , in different ways , expressed their willingness to receive refugees in their own countries if no other alternative is available .
At the same time , it is worrying that we have not learned anything from our costly experiences in the war in Bosnia .
The war in Kosovo has shown yet again that Europe must equip itself with a coordinated refugee policy .
Another important aspect concerns the integration of refugees into the community .
Mrs Zimmermann , in her report , lays great stress on an integrated approach .
I totally agree with that .
The Commission has submitted two separate proposals : one to encourage the reception and repatriation of asylum seekers and refugees and another on integration .
The rapporteur questions this approach .
I share her basic viewpoint , but since the Amsterdam Treaty has not yet entered into force , there was no practicable alternative .
I might also mention that the German Presidency , in its conclusions resulting from last week 's ministerial meeting , decided that the Commission should revise the section relating to the reception and repatriation of asylum seekers and refugees in order to make use of the EU 's release of EUR 15 million for the refugee crisis in Kosovo .
I have already approved the original proposal , and I have the support of my colleagues for tomorrow 's meeting of the Commission .
I also assume that I have the support of the Council of Ministers , as well as of this House .
We should also hold a joint discussion , at the earliest opportunity , on whether this amount is in fact proportionate to the level of need .
For the rest , I note that as regards the proceedings of the committee , Mrs Zimmermann takes the view that they should be as simple as possible .
I wholeheartedly agree with that .
Finally , let me say a few words about the Pirker report and Eurodac , the European system for the comparison of fingerprints .
It is very important to have such a system in place .
It is a precondition for the application , as envisaged , of the principle of the first country of asylum and the provisions of the Dublin Convention .
As you know , the Council of Ministers has now finalised the wording of Eurodac and asked the Commission to revise the proposal so that it is in accordance with the terms of the new Treaty .
The intention is therefore to wait until the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force , and in this way to strengthen both the democratic and legislative control .
All the issues we deal with in the area of justice and home affairs affect European citizens in their daily lives .
In a sense , it is paradoxical that internal European cooperation , which has the greatest impact on people 's lives , is something they know least about .
The introduction of more openness and transparency in our working methods would be a way of changing this .
Another way would be to ensure that we can arrive at some concrete decisions on certain key migration issues .
People should be able to see that what we are doing is having some effect .
A good deal of political will is also needed if we are to make the right decisions during the coming year .
I therefore regret that the requirement for unanimity will continue for the next five years .
It is certainly true that cooperation in this area is still a sensitive issue , particularly with regard to immigration policy .
Therefore , a very important task for the coming years is to ensure that there is sufficient confidence in the EU 's efforts in that area to allow the introduction of qualified majority voting to become a possibility .
Furthermore , we must give the concepts of freedom , security and justice enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty a clear and precise meaning .
The Tampere summit in the autumn will therefore be a milestone .
Parliament also has a very important mission to perform .
Clear signals must be given on the direction which European immigration and asylum policy needs to take .
I also think that the two debates we have had tonight have been valuable in illustrating how important that is .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
Electronic interchange of data between administrations ( IDA )
Mr President , this piece of work has a very long title for a project which is about the benefits of electronic transmission of data between administrations within the European Union .
It really is a success story , showing the citizens of the European Union how decisions taken on their behalf and the implementation of those decisions can be made much more transparent and readily identifiable .
Two or three projects are always quoted and are worth repeating : one is the work of the Medicines Evaluation Agency in London ; another is the project about helping people in the European Union find information about job vacancies right the way across the European Union ; and the third is a scheme concerning early contra-indications of toxic substances and drugs that can be dangerous to young people in particular .
The projects had their early teething troubles .
At this stage I wish to pay tribute to the work of the Commission officials with whom I have had many discussions ; between us we have put a great deal of effort into addressing many of these problems .
However , the work I am presenting to you here this evening is about ensuring that some of the early difficulties and the unnecessary duplication of efforts and compatibility problems are well on the way to solution .
There are also some issues concerning implementation .
I wish to stress that it is very important not only that each particular scheme has the benefit of electronic means of exchange of data but also that the methodology involved in each project can be transferred in its turn to other projects and is not just a one-off .
I hope that the comparatively small number of amendments from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy will meet with your approval .
I have no hesitation in commending both reports to you .
I should also like to draw attention to the updates in the reports produced by the IDA team , which provide a very valuable reference base of examples of how the work of the European Union institutions is bringing real benefits to the citizens of the European Union .
We have an unusual problem this evening in that we are running very much ahead of ourselves .
Mrs Peijs is not here yet .
The Commissioner due to respond was Mr Monti who , I understand , is still somewhere above the earth in an aeroplane .
However , Mrs Gradin is going to manfully stand in .
Mr President , I shall try to be Commissioner Monti for a few minutes .
In December 1997 the Commission presented its proposals for a second phase of the IDA programme .
Those two proposals have the objective to establish interoperable telematic networks in support of interinstitutional communication and the implementation of Community policies and activities .
In this second phase of the IDA programme , the Commission proposes to shift the focus from building infrastructure to coordination and support , with special regard to improving cost efficiency .
Thus , for instance , IDA projects will now benefit from generic telematic services acquired from the market .
These ideas have been fully endorsed by both the European Parliament and the Council in the first reading .
The Commission has already expressed its satisfaction that the Council has incorporated a majority of Parliament 's amendments in the first reading .
Moreover , the Commission accepted both common positions and recommended their rapid adoption .
In this second reading the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy proposes two amendments to the decision on guidelines and one amendment to the decision on interoperability measures .
These are based on amendments that the Council declined in the first reading .
However , the Commission believes that the formulation now proposed by the European Parliament not only would refine the political priorities of the IDA programme and increase its transparency but also could be expected to remove the objections raised by the Council in the first reading .
I am therefore pleased to announce that the Commission accepts all three amendments proposed by the European Parliament in the second reading .
Let me thank you once again and in particular the rapporteur , Mrs Read , for the constructive attitude with which Parliament has received these proposals of the Commission .
I am confident that , with your support , political agreement with the Council will soon be achieved and we will be able to resume this important task without delay .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon .
The sitting was suspended from 8.30 p.m. until 9.15 p.m.

Liability for payment of VAT
I should first like to inform the House that Mr Monti has probably already landed and is likely to arrive at any moment .
We have resumed an extra 15 minutes later to enable him to take part in the debate .
The next item is the report ( A4-0174 / 99 ) by Mr Harrison , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77 / 388 / EEC as regards the determination of the person liable for payment of value added tax ( COM ( 98 ) 0660 - C4-0705 / 98-98 / 0312 ( CNS ) ) .
Madam President , the purpose of the Commission proposal to amend the 1997 Directive determining the person liable for payment of VAT is to simplify the current very complicated system .
It is raised under the SLIM proposals , whose object is to make access to the single European market easier , especially for SMEs .
The underlying principle guiding the Commission proposal is to identify the person responsible for VAT , where companies are operating in more than one EU state , as the person who performs the taxable transaction , irrespective of whether he or she is established within the country where the transaction takes place .
It should further be noted that the proposal is interim in nature .
The Commission still fully intends to move to a definitive system of VAT collection and liability based on the principle of a single place of taxation .
Also , attached to this proposal , is the separate , but very welcome , idea of tackling the problem of VAT tax avoidance related to the supply of continuous products like gas or electricity .
Here it is proposed that tax should be charged on an annual basis where there are no pre-established successive statements of account .
So far , so good , but this is where the problems begin .
This delay of the definitive VAT regime is regrettable in itself but even more frustrating for the SMEs , which we want to be active participants in the single market , is the introduction of an interim system which seems as confusing as its predecessor .
That is why I have asked the Commission , to no avail , to quantify the problem and , in addition , to set out a strategy and timetable for this interim regime before the definitive system is introduced .
Why is the Commission so reluctant to do this ?
Secondly , as rapporteur , I am alarmed to learn from the Commission details of their consultation with the small business community on the proposal .
Why , for instance , did the Commission consult SMEs from only seven Member States ?
Furthermore , was the Commission not concerned to learn that one in three SMEs thought the present proposal might lengthen , not slash , VAT red tape .
Perhaps the Commission might reply to these points this evening , if it arrives on time .
Thirdly , the reverse charges system which keeps intact the principle of fraction payments should not in itself be over-used or abused .
Nevertheless , the abundance of exceptions allowed seems to deny the principle of simplifying , not complicating , the interim system .
Incidentally , I have still not received an explanation from the Commission why lawyers , consultancy bureaus and agents concerned with the transport of goods qualify as exceptions able to use the reverse charges system .
Why these and not others ?
I think we should be told .
Fourthly , the mutual assistance facility provided to SMEs to help them pole-vault over some of the recognised barriers to the market has itself been found to be unused and hence ineffective .
What has the Commission to say about this ?
Fifthly , I should like the Commission to clarify its position vis-Ã -vis NGOs which persistently lose valuable income because they are penalised by a system that frequently leaves them high and dry with irrecoverable VAT .
Finally , is the Commission prepared to deal with the outrageous practice whereby SMEs operating in Belgium and in other Member States are obliged in fulfilling current requirements for identifying their VAT tax responsibilities , to lodge financial guarantees with local banks , thereby absorbing valuable resources which cause mortal cash flow problems and which inhibit many such SMEs from entering the market
I would like to pause here and thank my colleague Mr RÃ¼big for his two amendments which I accept .
They are aimed at helping the SME sector although I realise that we are adding to the exceptions I have already talked about .
This Commission proposal seeks to help business succeed in the single market .
Its aspiration is fine but its application is suspect .
I hope the Commission can reassure Parliament on all the concerns I have raised tonight in my report and I hope the Commissioner who has been unable to listen to the arguments I have set out - it seems rather purposeless when he is not here - will be able to respond to those specific points .
Madam President , I should like to begin by saying that our group broadly shares the arguments put forward by the rapporteur , to whom we are grateful for his work in this important field .
We particularly welcome all the measures which facilitate the work of SMEs , in keeping with the SLIM exercise which lies behind some of the proposals now before us .
We also welcome the pressure being brought to bear for a re-examination of the question of NGOs , so as to devise rules better suited to their activities , rather than imposing on them a seemingly unjustifiable fiscal regime subjecting them to irrecoverable VAT .
Our group came out against Amendment No 7 , and I should now like to explain why .
In our opinion , the wording of this amendment is somewhat complicated : it covers various bodies , such as NGOs , which should have been handled separately . We also have our doubts about the call for a general strategy to improve the present transitional VAT regime while awaiting the definitive system .
In other words , we are afraid that - although several references are made to the definitive system , which we wish to see introduced as soon as possible - to lay down rules facilitating the transition without establishing a precise timetable is in fact a kind of pretext for postponing again and again a decision which should be taken as soon as possible .
The House , and Mr Harrison in particular , will recall that my own report on this subject called for a specific deadline : admittedly it was a little over-ambitious , but it was at least specific .
Unfortunately , the House rejected that proposal by just a few votes , most notably those of Mr Harrison and his group .
In conclusion , our group will vote in favour of all the amendments , albeit with two recommendations : firstly , that the Commission should take up our line of reasoning , Amendment No 7 in particular , so as to streamline and clarify the text ; secondly , that our request for a swift transition to the definitive VAT system should be reflected somehow , by setting a deadline or by giving strong arguments for the continued postponement .
Amendments Nos 8 and 9 , with which we agree - because there could be simpler ways of providing guarantees than those envisaged - would , for instance , become redundant if the definitive system were introduced .
Finally , we can endorse all Mr Harrison 's arguments during this interim phase ; let us vow to move ahead as rapidly as possible , and then many of these problems will cease to exist .
Madam President , I want to congratulate Mr Harrison on the presentation of his report .
The present system of VAT is so designed that the tax receipt is directly collected by the Member States on whose territory the consumption of the goods or services sold is deemed to take place .
In order to ensure this direct allocation of the tax , complex rules have been laid down .
Traders who wish to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the advent of the single market on 1 January 1993 usually perceive the need to fulfil tax obligations in several Member States as a barrier to the free movement of goods and services .
The internal market could not operate in a productive manner unless more user-friendly rules were implemented at national and European level in the area of tax collection .
In May 1997 the Commission proposed that VAT collection be included in the second phase of the SLIM programme .
Following this recommendation the Commission undertook to introduce legislation to simplify tax representation .
A panel of experts was also employed to advise the European Union on these various tax matters .
I welcome the efforts being made by the Union to simplify the tax regime in the area of VAT .
The Sixth VAT Directive allows traders who carry out taxable transactions in a given country to be the person liable to pay tax to the appropriate authorities .
However , the main features of the present legislation , as regards the determination of the persons liable for the payment of tax , are extremely complex and there is a wide difference in its actual proposed applications due to the many different tax options which are available to the Member States in addressing this issue .
In conclusion , I support the broad thrust of these measures but there is clearly more work to be done in simplifying the area of tax across the Union .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that this report by Mr Harrison is an important step that will allow us to further simplify VAT legislation by means of the rules governing the legislation on VAT representation and on mutual assistance on recovery .
I feel that these points are of particular importance for small and medium-sized enterprises .
We already know that the VAT system has many different legal bases in the European Union .
In my opinion Amendment No 6 is a typical example of how the system can be simplified , for instance in the case of goods installed , so that simplifications can also be made in this area .
Unfortunately , Mr Monti has not yet arrived .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .

The next item is the second report ( A4-0171 / 99 ) by Mr Cox , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the proposal for a Council Directive on restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products ( COM ( 97 ) 0030 - C4-0155 / 97-97 / 0111 ( CNS ) ) .
Madam President , I regret that Commissioner Monti is not here , not because I want to make a pedantic point about his absence , but rather because I would have liked to say this to him personally and have it put on the record in the House .
But even in his absence I am happy to do so .
He is one of a number of Commissioners in the present caretaker college whose resignation because of circumstances not to do with himself I deeply regret .
He has performed his European public function commendably and I would like to put that on the record .
I do not know whether in the future he is likely to be renominated or redesignated but in any event he is one of the many innocent victims of the fall-out of recent events and I would like to record that on my own behalf .
For those colleagues who are here I have little to add to what I said several weeks ago .
In substance the report before us is based on the Commission 's proposal , which is itself a useful proposal .
In terms of Parliament 's approach to it I hope we vote ' yes ' to new taxes , but ' no ' to more taxes .
In other words we want to see the tax base expand through the energy tax , but we want to state clearly and politically to the Commission and to the Council that we would like to see offsets of this new expanded energy tax base being recycled into lowering the tax wedge , the tax cost and labour .
That is the reason we support this ; it is not the only reason but a major reason .
To those who look at structural unemployment problems in the European Union and who condemn the high levels of unemployment but who refuse to contemplate , through their votes in this House , a broadening of the tax base in areas such as energy , I would say : could they please tell us on the record where will we find the alternative resources to address the tax crisis in a number of states to do with structural problems and unemployment .
My second general point : this proposal should not be exaggerated .
It is modest but useful .
However , in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs it is riddled with too many exceptions .
We support the Monti proposal but we want a greener Monti proposal .
We support some exceptions but we want the emphasis on green exceptions .
With regard to tax rates , as before we propose not a complex system of coming back on the question every so many years , but an accelerator principle to be subject to review potentially every five years .
We recognise that in some firms and sectors the energy cost may be very high as a proportion of total cost and for such firms and such sectors we need a mechanism to recognise and address the competitive handicap .
We believe that competitive handicap can be addressed by allowing Member States some degree of discretion , but in my view it should be subject to Commission review .
There is an amendment tomorrow to that effect , specifying how the Commission might review requests from sectors and Member States who plead a special case , and that amendment should be adopted , because this should not be used as a carte blanche simply to ignore the tax .
In summary , we support a new energy and eco-tax system but we do not support more taxes per se .
In other words , we demand fiscal neutrality .
We insist that the price of introducing this is that we lower labour taxes .
We want a simpler and more certain tax- based definition .
We want a more predictable base-deepening formula through an accelerator principle to determine the evolution of tax rates , given the new tax base .
We want competitive handicap to be recognised and addressed but only where that is genuine and not simply a carte blanche to ignore the tax altogether .
If that happens - and I hope it will happen in the vote - then I will recommend to colleagues that this is a report worth supporting .
Last time out , Madam President , we narrowly missed getting a majority .
That arose partly through a misunderstanding of some of the detail .
I hope there will be no misunderstandings tomorrow and indeed that some of the sceptics might re-read the report in substance and realise it is the way of the future .
I therefore commend the report to the House .
Mr Monti has just arrived .
I can only tell you , Commissioner , that Mr Cox has just had some very kind words to say about you , but perhaps you will be able to read them afterwards in our verbatim report of proceedings !
Madam President , on behalf of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , I would like to say that , in general , we agree with the three objectives put forward by the Commission in this directive : harmonising taxes , reducing emissions by increasing costs , and using this revenue to reduce social charges .
However , this is not very well planned , Mr Cox .
Do you know what kind of a reduction we would see in the emission of pollutants , particularly CO2 , if we were to increase prices , as you propose ?
We would not even see a reduction of 1 % .
We are making too great a fuss over something that will provide very few results .
Furthermore , we are currently trying to lower the price of electricity and gas through the liberalisation of the markets because energy in Europe is expensive and it is very difficult for us to compete with Japan and the United States .
We are trying to do everything at once but this is not the time for that .
We must do one thing at a time .
In any case , the amendments you are proposing will produce an increase in charges .
Nevertheless , according to the economic studies carried out by the Commission 's advisers , 150 000 jobs would be created and a 1 % reduction in CO2 emissions achieved .
It is true that the macroeconomic effects would be minor - neither inflation nor the deficit would rise a great deal - but at the moment our countries are all committed to their stability programmes .
In other words , I do not believe that your report is very timely , although this does not mean that I do not think that it is a good report .
I do not feel that this is the right time for it , nor is it the right time for the Commission 's proposal .
I am sorry to say that our group will not be supporting your amendments , Mr Cox .
Indeed , if this report is voted through , it will be quite unrealistic since it achieves very little .
In any event , you and I can be assured that progress will be made in this area in the future . But perhaps this is not the right time for it or the right time to introduce new taxes .
You say ' no new taxes ' and you are right .
But this should also apply to energy , since it is already very highly taxed in Europe .
Madam President , Mr Cox 's report was good and is now better .
It deserves our support , as does Commissioner Monti .

Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Cox , as we said before when discussing this report , our position has not altered since Mr Cox 's position has not altered in his report .
At the time , we put forward our analysis of the Commission 's proposal , which indicated that it was perhaps overly ambitious .
It hopes to achieve three objectives through a single set of rules , and we all know that the effectiveness of a set of rules is normally inversely proportional to the number of objectives it has .
As Mrs Estevan Bolea pointed out , the three objectives are quite ambitious and Mr Cox 's report tries to help us understand the exceptions and how they will be applied .
This is difficult to achieve with a set of fiscal rules that are actually designed to extend the scope of the tax .
In cases where new scope is defined for fiscal rules , such as VAT , there are many very detailed exceptions .
We are talking here about rules proposed by the Commission that increase the excise duty on oil products and increase taxation on energy products .
These are complicated rules and they also seek to meet environmental objectives that are difficult to achieve or that entail massive marginal costs , as Mrs Estevan Bolea explained . Moreover , there is no certainty as to the fiscal neutrality of the rules , or at least we have not been able to find it anywhere .
We therefore have no guarantees that the rules will be fiscally neutral .
We believe that Mr Cox has tried to simplify the exceptions , but we do not agree with this as we believe that it would be very difficult for the Commission to manage .
We are back to the famous method of giving the Commission , via the Member States , countless individual cases and authorisations to deal with according to the level of energy consumption , and so on .
Nonetheless , we do believe that there have to be some rules . And , as Mrs Estevan Bolea mentioned , we will eventually have to do something .
Perhaps we will have to divide up the objectives into various sets of rules and simplify the application of the ones we are discussing . Their objectives are commendable , but we believe that it would be extremely difficult to work towards them at this present moment in time .
As a result , Mr Cox , we will maintain the same position tomorrow as we did a few weeks ago , since , as far as we can see , the substance of your report has not changed in any way and , therefore , the Commission proposal has not been altered .
Madam President , Mr Cox has collaborated in producing a report which creates a sound basis for a review of energy taxation , for which I thank him sincerely .
Obviously , our group supports its chairman 's report .
Energy taxation is one of the best and most effective controls which society can use to reduce emissions and try to protect and improve the environment .
The main argument in the report is that Member States should be left some leeway when it comes to applying taxation , so long as the single market is not affected .
This has to be regarded as only right , as does the principle that renewable energy sources should not come within the scope of the directive .
The argument that there should be continued support for the production of combined electricity and heating is extremely important and most welcome .
The rapporteur , Patrick Cox , has already simplified and clarified the Commission 's proposal , but in my opinion it could have been simplified still further .
The minimum levels of taxation mentioned in Articles 7 and 8 could even be harmonised .
Levels of taxation for fuels used for production and those used for heating are now so close to one another that they could be harmonised .
I would like to emphasise the importance of two details here . Firstly , peat should in future become recognised incontrovertibly as a renewable biomass .
A marsh will produce roughly the same amount of peat in a year as a forest does wood pulp per unit area .
Thus , peat is unquestionably a renewable source of energy .
It is important to make this point , as peat is and will be of tremendous importance in the Nordic countries and Ireland too , for example .
The second point is this . The tax on aircraft fuel should be left for individual countries to decide themselves .
There are big differences in air traffic density among the Member States .
Internal air traffic in small countries is insignificant , but in the large Member States , such as Finland , it is extremely important .
For this reason , a harmonised taxation system would not treat different Member States fairly .
Taking these observations into account , I believe the report is excellent and I give it my wholehearted support .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we welcome this report as a small step in the right direction .
It is clear to all of us that a great deal still remains to be done before we can finally achieve a breakthrough in the area of energy taxation .
But it is essential for us that the second stage of ecological tax reform in Germany is not slowed down by Brussels and that in the medium-term we can finally reach a stage where there are pioneer states that can lead the way in the European Union .
We are particularly pleased that there are exceptions that are ' green ' and that involve not only energy-intensive operations but also - and this must be clear to everyone - environmentally friendly renewable energies that can be exempted from energy taxation .
The fact that nuclear energy is also to be taxed pleases us greatly , as otherwise we would have an imbalance in the energy taxation proposal .
We are pleased that our amendment received a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy because it is crucial for us that local public transport can be exempted .
For there is one thing that we must not forget : this energy taxation has a purpose , which is to help the environment and help to meet the commitment that we undertook to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
This is what all these various possibilities are designed to do .
What we need now is for the Council of Ministers to reach agreement as soon as possible .
In this context I am pleased to inform you that the German Minister for the Environment , Mr Trittin , is endeavouring , during his visits to the Member States , to ensure that we reach agreement on this issue as soon as possible .
Madam President , it is most regrettable that the Cox report is only now coming before the plenary again after being postponed for two months .
On the other hand , I am glad that Mr Cox 's report has not lost too much of its force in the intervening period .
It still offers a clear alternative to the hybrid Commission proposal .
A large number of counter-productive derogations have been scrapped , and I shall be glad to support the Cox report .
The Council must now make up its mind .
Either it sticks to the international agreements on limiting CO2 emissions and reducing environmental pollution or it opts for the unclear situation of the status quo , with further damage to our climate system as a result .
I am in favour of abolishing the exemption from tax for civil aviation fuel .
If the European Union unilaterally introduced a tax , however , this might lead to considerable distortion of aircraft movements .
I think an excellent alternative would be an overflying tax as advocated earlier , in conjunction with air traffic control services .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in international competition we need a sensible form of energy taxation .
In my opinion there are several reasons why the issue of energy taxation is one of the most forward-looking debates in the European Union and beyond .
Positively speaking , it mainly involves a system of incentives to encourage an economical and efficient use of our resources .
But we must proceed with restraint to ensure that the baby - and therefore the economy - is not thrown out with the bathwater .
After all , we are not against the introduction of harmonised energy taxation in principle .
However , with it we must guarantee a level playing field in terms of competition .
My country , for example , has taken a leading role in this area .
Accordingly , the general introduction of upper limits on taxation for energy-intensive firms , as provided in Article 15 of the Commission proposal , makes a great deal of sense .
We should not forget that such firms have already in the past updated their technical equipment and brought their energy consumption closer to minimum levels .
In this case higher energy tax cannot achieve any further saving .
We can prevent the increased costs that this would entail and thus support the competitiveness of our companies and of Europe as a location for business .
For this reason we should also think about discontinuing the optional exemption of energy products that are not used as fuel and of energy products that are used to produce electricity and heat , as provided in Article 13 .
In any case , those Member States whose energy taxation rates are above the minimum level should at least be given the opportunity to adjust their taxation levels accordingly .
A flexible system of upper limits could make it possible to find reasonable solutions .

I should like , first of all , to present my apologies to you , Madam President , as well as to all Members of Parliament in the Chamber at this time , in particular to Mr Harrison and Mr Cox , the two rapporteurs .

Although I had planned my flight with plenty of time to spare , that proved insufficient . I apologise for this .
I would like to thank Mr Cox for what I understand have been very generous words on his part .
I would also like to thank Mr Spencer .
Mr Cox , the report you have drafted and the conclusions you have drawn are extremely interesting and important .
I am very pleased that you support the reasoning behind this proposal and the manner in which that reasoning is translated into action .
The Commission has put a proposal to the Council , the main thrust of which is the need to modernise the Community system for the taxation of mineral oils and to extend its scope to all energy products .
This is necessary to improve the functioning of the single market by reducing the tax-induced distortions that exist at present .
The Commission has also used the proposal to meet its obligation to review minimum rates of taxation on mineral oils and , at the same time , to respond to the ECOFIN Council request to come forward with new proposals following the deadlock in the negotiations on the CO2 energy tax .
I need hardly add that in this context there is growing concern about the environmental effects of the combustion of fossil fuels .
This has been highlighted by the recent adoption by the Council of emission targets for the Union in response to the Kyoto Protocol .
The achievement of these targets will not be easy and fiscal measures are one of the concrete tools which can be utilised to assist in the task .
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 23 , 32 , 33 and parts of Amendment No 25 .
However , the suggestion that we should move straight to the second stage of minimum rates from January 2000 and increase these annually by the rate of inflation plus 2 % for five years cannot be accepted .
So far as deletion of the initial stage of the minimum levels of taxation is concerned , it is true that the operative date of 1 January 1998 belongs to the past .
However , discussions in the Council have shown that even the proposed minimum levels are causing difficulties for a number of Member States .
Any increase in these levels is therefore not acceptable .
The same applies to the suggestion that minimum tax levels should be increased annually by inflation plus 2 % for a period of five years .
The Commission proposal restricts the increase to the rate of inflation in order to assist Member States who would be required to impose substantial increases in tax simply to attain the proposed minimum levels .
To require them in addition to impose further increases in excess of inflation is unacceptable .
The removal of most of the proposed compulsory and optional exemptions and reductions relating to products which are not currently taxed cannot be accepted .
These exemptions and reductions have been formulated for a number of reasons .
Some exist in current legislation ; others are necessary to reflect Community obligations under international agreements and a further group is considered necessary to protect the competitiveness of Community enterprises .
Finally , I should just add a word or two on Mr Harrison 's report .
This exercise in simplification , which recently led the Commission to present a proposal for a directive on the right to deduct , is a top priority for us .
This proposed directive constitutes one more step in that direction ; in essence , its aim is to prevent national administrations in future from obliging non-resident traders to appoint a tax representative .
I am pleased to note that Mr Harrison 's report backs this approach and welcomes the Commission 's proposal .
However , the amendments do not strike me as acceptable ; but I assure you that the Commission shares the rapporteur 's view that the adoption of the definitive system will constitute the final and most important simplification for traders .
Thank you , Mr Monti .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Heating systems for passenger compartments
The next item is the report ( A4-0170 / 99 ) by Mrs Billingham , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 78 / 548 / EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to heating systems for the passenger compartment of motor vehicles ( COM ( 98 ) 0526 - C4-0552 / 98-98 / 0277 ( COD ) ) .
Since the rapporteur is not present , Mr RÃ¼big is the first speaker .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , you will all remember the discussion that we have had several times in this Chamber in the course of the last year .
Parliament developed a completely new approach to technical legislation in the context of the debates on the EU bus construction directive and the Murphy report .
The European legislator would draw up the political framework , then the users and experts , particularly from the field of standardisation , would sort out the details in working groups .
In this way we would achieve a greater degree of agreement and acceptance among those concerned .
We take the key concept of simplifying legislation very seriously .
The present proposal could also be implemented using this system .
The text might then read as follows : ' Interior heating systems for cars must be such that they can be operated safely ; they must be covered sufficiently to prevent passengers from being burned , and finally they should emit few harmful chemicals ' .
A technical working group could then have developed the details from these principles .
In this context I am keenly awaiting the Council 's common position on the bus directive , as I am sure that through codecision we will not only find a solution to this dossier but we will be able to set the course for the future .
With regard to Parliament 's report it remains to be said that we fully support Mrs Billingham 's amendments .
Moreover , we consider efficiency tests for heaters to be both necessary and important as the quality of fitted heaters must be quantifiable , for example whether the engine coolant can be brought to operating temperature before the engine is started .
Amendment No 10 also deals with the passenger safety aspect .
If the heater is to be installed in the passenger compartment it should be securely compartmented off .
We do not wish to restrict ourselves to a single type of design for this , however , and for this reason , in Amendment No 12 , we advocate a general heat-resistant material .
I would like to express my thanks for the cooperation that was achieved with the experts and the rapporteur , and I look forward with anticipation to tomorrow 's vote .
Madam President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Billingham , for her in-depth examination of our proposal and her excellent report .
The aim of the proposal amending Council Directive 78 / 548 / EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to heating systems for the passenger compartment of motor vehicles is to broaden the scope of the directive , extending it from cars alone to all vehicle categories .
Furthermore it contains new provisions on combustion heaters , to ensure that such systems comply with strict safety and environmental protection standards compatible with modern technology .
The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 6 and Nos 8 , 9 and 11 .
Amendments Nos 1 to 3 and Nos 5 , 6 and 8 basically clarify the original proposal , whereas Nos 4 , 9 and 11 relate to specific safety aspects of combustion heaters .
The Commission too is keen to lay down adequate safety provisions and therefore welcomes these amendments .
However , the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 , 10 and 12 .
No 7 commits the Commission to drawing up proposals for testing the efficiency of combustion heaters by 1 October 2001 .
The Commission believes that it will be market operators who guarantee a high level of efficiency in this field , and that legislative action is therefore unnecessary .
What is more , the conformity of combustion heaters with the provisions of the directive will ensure that high levels of safety and environmental protection are maintained , in line with modern technology .
If any specific problems or technological innovations change this situation in the future , the Commission will be informed by the national type-approval authorities in the appropriate working groups and will adopt the necessary measures .
Moreover , as regards the date of entry into force , 1 October 2001 seems a somewhat unrealistic deadline for new legislative initiatives .
Amendments Nos 10 and 12 offer an alternative to the positioning of combustion heaters in the passenger compartment of coaches and minibuses .
The Commission proposal permits the installation of heating systems in the passenger compartment as long as a hermetically sealed casing is used which is fireproof even if it overheats .
The wording of these amendments guarantees a level of safety which is equivalent to , if not lower than , that envisaged in the directive ; in particular , they do not explicitly guarantee the same safety level in relation to the risk of fire .
In conclusion , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 6 and Nos 8 , 9 and 11 , but is obliged to reject Amendments Nos 7 , 10 and 12 .
The Commission intends to pursue its useful dialogue with the European Parliament in the conviction that a constructive solution can be found .
Thank you , Mr Monti .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The sitting was closed at 10.04 p.m.
Approval of the Minutes
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
That will be corrected , Mr Balfe .
The Minutes were approved
Mr President , I want to draw to your attention the fact that the agriculture debates will be starting in a few minutes .
The amendments to two of the reports are still not available in English .
I asked for the amendments yesterday evening .
One set had appeared by this morning - to the Fantuzzi report - but there are still no copies in English of the amendments to the JovÃ© Peres and Happart reports .
It really is not good enough to expect us to debate when we do not have the amendments in our own language .
Mrs Hardstaff , I have been informed by my services that there was a technical problem .
The translations will be circulated as soon as possible .
Mr President , I merely wish to refer to the problems concerning the accessibility of the airports around Strasbourg .
Along with many other Members , I am often unable to arrive on time at the start of a sitting . This is because although the city of Strasbourg provides us with a free transfer service , the operators try to make up large groups of passengers , and at times we have had to wait one and a half or two hours for a sufficient number of travellers to arrive .
I am grateful to the city of Strasbourg for the service it provides for us free of charge but I do feel , however , that the previous arrangements should be reinstated to ensure a more flexible service .
We have been informed of budget cuts , and I appreciate that cost is an important consideration . Nevertheless , if we are truly serious about saving money , we should only come to Strasbourg once or twice a year and meet in Brussels the rest of the time as it is much cheaper .
We all enjoy coming to Strasbourg , but we would like to see a return to the previous standard of services .
Thank you very much .
I think we are all mindful of what you have just told us .
We will continue our representations to the French authorities and we shall see if there is some way in which we can improve things , since I am aware of the problems that you face .
Mr President , yesterday morning I left home at 8.10 .
Having arrived at the airport and boarded the plane , I was told my flight had been cancelled .
We arrived here last night at 10.40 .
That is 14 hours of travelling to get to this place .
Quite frankly , if Air France cannot provide a better service to Strasbourg airport then a lot of British Members are just not going to turn up in Strasbourg .
Mr Corrie , I would not be adding very much if I said that you have all our sympathy , but that does not change anything .
Yesterday evening , we heard a similar story in the Bureau from Mr Collins , a Vice-President .
Unfortunately , there are problems .
However , I do not want to continue this discussion now .
Mr President , I would like the European Parliament to take note of the fact that last night a missile fired by NATO hit a passenger train in Yugoslavia , claiming dozens of victims , both dead and wounded .
It is not yet certain - at least I do not know - whether there were Greek journalists on that train who were travelling within Yugoslavia .
I believe that this catastrophic act perpetrated against the people of Yugoslavia and against a civilian means of transport is a clear violation of human rights and may even be regarded as a crime against humanity .
I think that the European Parliament must denounce these actions and this disaster that is taking place in Europe .
Mr Theonas , a debate will take place tomorrow in the presence of the Council and the Commission on the situation in Kosovo and all these problems .
Mr President , I want to raise a point of order .
Although the preceding points of order may all seem rather disparate , in actual fact they are not .
With regard to the transport problems , I must remind you that we are allies and so , in this case , Air France should not be criticised because the problems are due to air traffic having been disrupted by the military flights over Serbia and Kosovo .
Those who like criticising France may gain satisfaction from doing so but they are quite simply mistaken .
Thank you very much for those explanations , Mr Duhamel .
I think we have dealt with enough problems that are outside the agenda , and we must now proceed with our agenda .
Agriculture
The next item is the joint debate on :

the report ( A4-0168 / 99 ) by Mr Happart , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposals for 16 Council Regulations on the prices for agricultural products ( 1999-2000 ) ( COM ( 99 ) 0038 - C4-0077 / 99 to C4-0091 / 99 and C4-0093 / 99-99 / 0025 ( CNS ) to 99 / 0039 ( CNS ) and 99 / 0801 ( CNS ) ) ; -the report ( A4-0164 / 99 ) by Mr JovÃ© Peres , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , onI.the proposal for a Council Regulation amending and correcting Regulation ( EC ) No 2200 / 96 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables ( COM ( 98 ) 0647 - C4-0709 / 98-98 / 0309 ( CNS ) ) II.the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 2202 / 96 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits ( COM ( 98 ) 0647 - C4-0710 / 98-98 / 0310 ( CNS ) ) ; -the report ( A4-0173 / 99 ) by Mr Fantuzzi , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council Regulation on measures to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries ( COM ( 98 ) 0683 - C4-0158 / 99-98 / 0330 ( CNS ) ) ; -the oral question ( B4-0159 / 99 ) by Mr Colino Salamanca , to the Commission , on imports of garlic from third countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am today presenting my final report to this House as I will be standing down at the elections on 13 June .
I will be returning to southern Belgium to continue my work of promoting European construction in other ways .
We need Europe and our children even more so .
Before the 1992 reform of the common agricultural policy , the report on agricultural prices was one of the most sought-after and most prestigious reports .
Although this has now lost its attraction , the prices for agricultural products still form the bulk of farmers ' income , providing between 60 % and 80 % depending on the types of product .
My intention with these proposals to adjust agricultural prices is to send a clear message to the European farming community . I want to assure them that this House intends to defend their legitimate interests at a particularly difficult time when doubt is creeping in among farmers , particularly the younger ones .
We are increasingly telling our farmers about the necessary enlargement of the European Union and they are not against this .
Some have already set up in the new areas , mainly in Poland .
However , they do not want the farming community to have to foot the bill for this enlargement .
They are prepared to make the necessary effort and sacrifices as citizens of Europe , like everyone else , but only to a fair and equal degree .
This is why I am talking about adjustment and not increase .
Is it a crime to compensate for the loss of 1.9 % due to the changeover from the green ecu to the euro ?
Is it a crime to include farmers when compensating for the inflation rate of 1.9 % given that other European workers are justifiably benefiting from this compensation ? For example , I am very happy for the German steel workers who have obtained a 4 % wage increase .
The European Parliament must ignore the Council of Ministers and the national governments which only want to recover the unspent amounts in order to help balance their domestic budgets .
In addition , the richest of these governments want this money in order to partially renationalise their agriculture , with blatant disregard for farmers in the poorest Member States .
If the Council had at least had the courage to refinance the Structural Funds by transferring the budget allocations , farmers could have been bailed out .
What hope can we give and what jobs can we offer for the future to the 200 000 farmers leaving the profession every year in Europe ?
Between 500 and 600 farmers are leaving farming every day , with this figure reaching over 3 000 per week in certain areas .
The desertification of the countryside due to the farmers ' exodus is killing the rural environment .
If we cannot save the rural society of the poorest regions today , what will we do tomorrow when the USA , having imposed on us its dollar bananas and hormonised meat , forces us to abandon these areas in the name of the World Trade Organisation ?
I do not want a society ' made in the USA ' for my children , where money is more important than people .
I want the opposite .
If we do not adjust these prices and provide the necessary refinancing of the Structural Funds , we will destroy the individuality of European agriculture where diversity goes hand in hand with quality .
Mr President , the Commission 's proposal amounts to minor modifications of the COM in fresh fruit and vegetables and the processing of citrus fruits .
Where fresh fruit and vegetables are concerned , it is proposed to meet the cost of selecting and packing products to be distributed free of charge from the Community budget .
Clearly , if what is involved is providing an alternative to the withdrawal and distribution of products , free distribution should not become burdensome to the producer organisations .
In addition , the Commission has proposed authorising members of producer organisations to sell part of their produce outside the commercial circuits of the producer organisation to which they belong .
As a result of the 1996 reform , most of the instruments designed to regulate the market were replaced by producer organisations ' operating funds .
The producer organisations play a central role in the COM and it is essential to avoid any modification of the regulations which might weaken them .
The Commission has proposed making it easier for members of recognised producer organisations to sell a limited part of their produce direct to the consumer .
We might wonder how a producer organisation can regard as a right the abandonment of its main purpose - marketing its members ' produce .
To date , direct sales have been severely restricted and can only take place on the producer 's farm .
This approach could have a negative effect on the main role of producer organisations - marketing their members ' produce .
Although current regulations ought to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to local situations , there is no justification for jeopardising the general system in order to comply with local practice which is far removed from areas where the bulk of the Community 's production of fruit and vegetables is concentrated .
In such cases , it would seem wiser to resort to subsidiarity and to allow each Member State to regulate local practice as appropriate .
However , to avoid undermining the main purpose of producer organisations , any exemption should be accompanied by a tightening of the limits on the amount of its members ' produce that can be marketed outside the producer organisation so as to offset the producer organisation 's loss of marketable production .
Concerning the production of citrus fruits for processing , the present system leads to serious delays in the receipt of aid . In the case of citrus fruits processed at the start of the season , aid sometimes arrives twelve months later .
The anticipatory scheme only partly compensates for these delays and some producer organisations are likely to be tempted to stop handing over their production for processing and to opt instead for the withdrawal arrangements .
The Commission has come up with an appropriate proposal to resolve this problem .
Aid has been granted for the processing of citrus fruits since 1976 , and in the intervening period it has proved necessary to correct and prevent interference between the withdrawal scheme and the processing scheme .
Great care should be taken when setting the conditions for aid to processing in order to prevent withdrawal from becoming a more attractive option than processing .
The Commission 's proposal does not resolve the imbalance between the thresholds set for the processing of citrus fruits and production reality .
This situation could result in the processing of citrus fruits becoming less profitable than withdrawal .
An increase in withdrawals would have a negative effect on the environment and public opinion would be much more strongly opposed to it than it would be to aid to processing .
The lack of balance between the commitment appropriations and the actual payments highlights the imbalance between the instruments for the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables .
Following reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables , a surplus in commitment appropriations of ECU 400 million over payments was recorded . Yet the thresholds set for processed citrus fruits have resulted in chronic inadequacies in budget allocations .
It is therefore proposed to increase the threshold to the average quantities processed in the last four years . An additional expenditure of ECU 64 million would be involved .
This figure falls well within the financial margin of expenditure not incurred for withdrawals .
Another cause of destabilisation of the system is the lack of a penalty limit .
A 20 % limit on penalties should be set .
In this connection , it is worth remembering that such a system existed in the past and is indeed still applied to other regulated produce subject to thresholds .
Mr President , I wholeheartedly welcome this proposal for a regulation on measures to promote agricultural products in third countries .
It is a sign that , despite all the difficulties and uncertainties over reform of the CAP following the agreements reached in Berlin , some important and innovative moves are afoot .
It is also a sign that agricultural products are in need nowadays not so much of policies to defend and protect them but of aggressive , innovative policies to promote them judiciously on third countries ' markets .
All too often - not least in this House - we have heard talk of globalisation as though it merely meant net losses for European agriculture .
This initiative puts us back on the right track : globalisation also offers unique opportunities for European agriculture .
After all , there is growing demand in the world for high-quality farm produce and food , and the EU has the highest standards of food , safety and quality in the world .
Therefore we should not stand on the sidelines hoping for the best , but should equip ourselves with the appropriate instruments and strategies to be competitive and to make the most of this growth in demand around the world for high-quality agri-food products .
Flooding world markets with low added-value commodities is the wrong approach , since it will be increasingly difficult to compete on such commodities with countries whose costs are lower than our own ; furthermore , as we are aware , the WTO has placed both volume and value-based ceilings on export refunds ; and lastly , we know that the new Millennium Round talks are to begin soon and should not have too many illusions .

What is more , Commissioner , we might get into hot water over these issues and make our presence felt rather late in the day .
I see from the budget of the US Department of Agriculture that , in the three years from 1996 to 1999 , over USD 150 million per year was spent on policies to support the internationalisation of agriculture .
Of course , some promotional work has already been done in the EU - geared likewise to non-European countries - in the general context of promotion activities , the most outstanding in recent years being support for the IOOC initiative to promote olive oil on world markets .
I should like to conclude with four points .
The first is that this should be an opportunity to bring together and integrate all the promotional measures , not just those geared to external markets , but also those relating to the European internal market .
Too many fragmentary initiatives have been devised with different motives , timing and procedures , and this opportunity should be taken to put them all into some kind of order .
The second is that a budget increase is required .
If this initiative is to be a serious one , it cannot be restricted to EUR 15 million - a derisory sum - and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has proposed that , for 2000 to 2003 , the funding should be boosted from EUR 30 m to 50 m .
By the same token , the funding for all the promotional activities scheduled under Agenda 2000 , limited to EUR 100 m from now until 2006 , may be inadequate .
My third point is that a more long-term view is needed .
It is no accident that we have proposed extending from two to three years the period for revising the list of products to fall under the promotional measures and the duration of the programmes , in order to lend greater certainty and effectiveness to the measures .
My fourth and final point is that the basic principle behind this regulation should be adhered to , namely subsidiarity and complementarity , in order that initiatives are not imposed from Brussels in a clean sweep but that they complement , blend with and in turn stimulate similar measures devised by the national authorities and by producers ' associations , so that all the players involved in European agriculture and in its future challenges are following the same approach .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the explanatory statement of the opinion I am privileged to present to you today , the REX Committee has indicated that , in its view , the Commission 's proposal is very important and represents a great opportunity .
The reform of the common agricultural policy in the framework of Agenda 2000 ought indeed to include a package of external measures providing for the development of actions to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries .
Such actions must be aimed at increasing the competitiveness of European products on the world markets , and to this end , it is essential to promote their image .
Information and publicity ought to result in good outlets for quality Community products with regulated designations of origin , particularly when countries with stringent quality requirements are targeted . These countries usually have high purchasing power .
The present initiative is particularly timely as the results of the campaign to promote olive oil and fibre flax , to which Mr Fantuzzi also referred , are already available .
Sales of these products outside the Community have increased thanks to ad hoc methods of promotion .
The proposal , which has been amended by the Committee on Agriculture , lists a whole range of possible actions . Nevertheless , the best publicity will always be the quality , safety , hygiene , labelling and respect for the environment that are characteristic of Community products .
The REX Committee is certainly in favour of this proposal and believes that it merits consideration .
Nevertheless , as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out , there are some grounds for concern as to whether such an ambitious project can be adequately financed through the annual sum of only EUR 15 million allocated to it until the year 2003 .
In view of the large sums allocated to the CAP , there could well be scope for an increase in funding . If wisely managed , this would enable our exports to grow in an increasingly globalised international trading environment .
I shall conclude , Mr President , by reiterating that the REX Committee supports this proposal . The committee is particularly in favour of the principle on which the proposal is based , namely , strengthening the Union 's commercial policy through the promotion of agricultural products in third countries .
Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , I should like to put an oral question concerning the present state of the market for garlic .
This is certainly not a new situation . It is a recurring problem , but I feel it is important to draw attention to it , particularly as unofficial imports of garlic from third countries are directly responsible for the collapse of the garlic market .
I should reiterate that this is not a new situation , and the reason for putting this question now is that in accordance with Regulation No 1137 / 98 of 29 May , the period in which import licences may be granted for a maximum of 12 000 tonnes of garlic from China is due to expire on 31 May .
According to the figures I have available , total imports for 1998 total approximately 50 000 tonnes , though average imports for the European Union in the period 1990-1997 were only of the order of 40 000 tonnes .
It is surprising to find references to countries such as Malaysia - which did not export any garlic to the European Union in 1993 - Jordan and India suddenly appearing .
The figures of 7 300 tonnes , 6 167 tonnes and almost 1 000 tonnes respectively for 1998 are quoted , over and above the nominal 12 000 tonnes from China .
This immediately gives rise to suspicions that triangular operations may be taking place involving garlic of Chinese origin which arrives here following deals with third countries .
As a result , the quota and safeguard procedures are becoming meaningless . The situation has been further aggravated by the failure to insist on certificates of origin for imported garlic and by the failure to apply the appropriate tariff codes correctly to differentiate between green garlic with undeveloped cloves and garlic to be sold dried or partly dried .
It seems that the Commission needs to be reminded that this particular crop is of great social significance in certain areas : it is produced mainly in regions with structural problems - Objective 1 regions . It should also be borne in mind that in addition to adopting the set of measures applied to date , there is a need for further measures , and the possibility of aid to rural development could be floated .
What is at issue is a fall in production in areas such as Castile-La Mancha , Castile-Leon and Andalusia , which are all Objective 1 regions . Their economic activity revolves around this product as it represents the only means of making a living in these areas .
Documents produced by the Commission reveal that it is aware of the problem .
For instance , Regulation No 1197 states that , since 1993 , the Commission has noted a significant increase in imports of garlic from China relative to previous years .
As far as I am aware , the cost of producing garlic in the European Union is of the order of 220 pesetas per kilo whereas Chinese garlic is priced at around 135 pesetas per kilo .
Clearly , the ensuing fall in the price of garlic could cause a significant upheaval in the Community market . Indeed , this is already happening .
In Regulation No 544 , the Commission states that following the introduction of a safeguard clause relating to the import of garlic from China , a significant increase in imports of garlic from certain third countries with no tradition of exporting garlic to the Community has suddenly taken place over the last few years .
The Commission itself has suggested that this raises doubts as to the true origin of the garlic imported from these third countries .
Imports of garlic of dubious origin have continued to increase .
In the light of this data provided by the Commission itself and since the market is collapsing , it is essential to put pressure on the Commission to take action to remedy the situation .
Given that the Commission is aware of the situation and that it is also aware that the measures taken so far are inadequate - as the state of the market proves - it is simply not acceptable that no further measures are being taken .
The garlic producers have raised the possibility of setting a maximum world trading quota , and of even setting a deterrent tariff barrier for quantities above this maximum world trading quota .
I realise that these issues will be dealt with during future negotiations .
We would , however , urge the Commission to remain vigilant and to introduce appropriate measures to prevent the annual drop in producers ' incomes . I should emphasise once again that their income has been falling year on year since 1993 .

Finally , I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to express my support for the reports by Mr JovÃ© and Mr Fantuzzi , particularly as regards the processing of citrus fruits and aid for the promotion of agricultural products in third countries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would ask you to bear with me if what I have to say takes some time , but I do now have to comment on four different reports .
I should like to start straight away with the price proposals for the 1999 / 2000 marketing year .
The proposals which the Commission has made are in line with the same stability policy which has already been pursued in preceding price packages .
They are primarily intended to guarantee the rollover which is necessary for legal reasons .
The reform will in any case mean that in future , far fewer market management parameters will need to be set on an annual basis .
Under these circumstances , the Commission is proposing not to increase the amounts .
I believe that we should confine ourselves strictly to measures which do not run counter to the overall strategy agreed in Berlin .
At this point , I should also like to thank Mr Happart very much for his report , along with the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the members of the other committees who were actively involved in the preparatory work for this report .
With your permission , I will now turn to the amendments .
I will begin with those which seek to increase all the prices and aids so as to take account of the inflation rate of 1.9 % and the introduction of the euro .
This concerns the following groups of amendments : firstly , Amendments Nos 13 , 16 , 23 , 33 , 38 and 42 on the rate of inflation ; then Amendments Nos 14 , 17 , 24 , 34 and 39 on the introduction of the euro ; and finally , Amendments Nos 15 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 25 , 27 to 31 , 36 and 41 on raising prices .
The Commission cannot agree to these amendments , because they would run directly counter to the need to improve the competitiveness of Community produce , both in the internal market and on the world markets .
Secondly , this would involve additional expenditure of EUR 463 million for the year 2000 .
If that is applied to the forthcoming financial framework from 2000 to 2006 , the additional costs come to over EUR 3 billion .
Finally , this would also mean that we would be unable to honour our international commitments in full , that is those on reducing internal support .
Incidentally , Council Regulation No 2799 / 98 on the new agri-monetary arrangements provides in any case that if there is proven loss of income as a result of the introduction of the euro , then compensatory payments may be granted , provided that the conditions specified are met .
On Amendment No 1 on compulsory set-aside , which amounts to keeping the set-aside rate as it currently stands for the coming years , I should like to point out that part of the Berlin compromise is that a basic set-aside rate of 10 % should apply for the whole of the period from 2000 to 2006 .
Amendment No 2 concerns flax and hemp and aims to promote the use of these agricultural products for non-food purposes .
I understand the reasons behind this amendment .
But I cannot agree to it , because this issue needs to be considered in a wider context .
It will also need to be taken into account when the future set-aside rate and the options for rural development measures are discussed .
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 seek to introduce new measures to manage pigmeat production .
I should simply like to draw your attention here to the fact that subsidising the pig sector at the present time will only compound the problem , because farmers will be less willing to reduce the size of their herds .
Implementing a proposal of this kind would also be very costly .
Incidentally , I might also point out here that in the management committee we have repeatedly invited the Member States to make structural proposals .
We have discussed all the variants which have been mentioned here .
The Member States did not find a single one of these attractive , and stated on the contrary that appropriate market management was a sufficient measure .
I now come to the amendments relating to the wine sector .
Amendments Nos 3 and 32 on the granting of permanent abandonment premiums in respect of wine-growing areas and extending the deadline for submitting applications for premiums for the 1999 / 2000 marketing year from 31 December 1999 to 31 March 2000 do not cause any difficulties .
However , the Commission is unable to accept the remaining amendments on the wine sector for the following reasons .
Firstly , this will either pre-empt the reform - which has been agreed at political level - or might even go against it .
Secondly , as regards the ban on planting new areas under vines , I might point out that this was extended in the last price package until 31 August 2000 , and that in 1998 an additional 10 000 hectares of planting rights had to be granted for both the 1998 / 99 and 1999 / 2000 marketing years .
The Commission cannot agree to the other Amendments Nos 26 and 31 on the monthly reimbursement of storage costs for sugar , simply because the proposed reduction is indisputably due to the fall in interest rates .
In the light of the new timetable for the reform of the common organisation of the markets in the milk sector , Amendment No 35 is unjustified .
Finally , as regards the three amendments on the beef and veal sector , Amendments Nos 37 , 40 and 41 , I would point out that they are unnecessary in view of the proposals to reform this sector .
In conclusion , I would ask you to bear in mind that while we are waiting for Agenda 2000 to be implemented , we should on no account lose sight of the fact that underlying these price proposals are efforts to achieve greater simplification and stability which are reinforced by the broad consensus in this debate .
Since the report Mr Happart has presented today is his last , I wish to thank him very much and , Mr Happart , you can take this assurance with you for your continued political career : for as long as I work here , I will not allow the Americans to dominate European agriculture , but like you will fight for us to retain our independence in Europe !
I now turn to the report on a number of adjustments to the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables .
As you know , this is only the second marketing year that this new market organisation has been in force , and you also know that in any case it is intended to carry out a general review of the way this market organisation is operating next year .
This being the case , I think it is too early for us to make more far-reaching changes than the ones proposed at this stage .
During the recent negotiations on the price package , however , the Commission did agree to make a few minor adjustments so as to improve the way in which the market organisation operates .
That alone is therefore the aim of these proposals .
I should like to thank Mr JovÃ© Peres for his report , in which he also registers a large degree of support for the Commission 's proposals .
Like him , I too believe that it is necessary to strengthen the producer organisations , on which the major burden of market management clearly falls .
Mr Peres also refers to a number of problems which we will have to deal with during the forthcoming review .
The Commission therefore believes that many of the proposed amendments are premature and would not appear to be feasible without a detailed analysis .
This applies to Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 4 and 6 to 9 .
I can assure Parliament , however , that the Commission will pay careful attention to these points when it reviews the market organisation next year .
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 and 5 , because the producer organisations need to have the financial and technical capability to monitor their products appropriately .
That brings me to Mr Fantuzzi 's report .
Here too , my particular thanks go to the rapporteur , but also to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the other committees which have given their opinions on this proposal .
I am glad that the proposal has met with broad support .
The aim of the proposal is to create an operational instrument which will increase the international competitiveness of European agricultural products .
We must certainly not - and here I agree with Mr Fantuzzi - stand by and watch while our most important competitors in the new markets - such as those in south-east Asia and Latin America - pursue an active policy of export promotion , when we have nothing even remotely equivalent to set against it .
We will therefore have to make considerable efforts in this field in the future and develop a wide range of information and promotional measures so as to consolidate our position in these markets , particularly because European products are as a rule highly processed and that can only mean that jobs are also at stake here .
The Commission will observe the principles of subsidiarity and complementarity and will essentially confine itself to acting as a link or as a catalyst and ensuring European added value .
Of course , we can only take action within our limited budget , and we should also make use of the best available know-how from outside .
This approach therefore requires the Member States - both the private and the public sector - to be heavily involved in terms of making cofinancing available and providing the necessary support for managing and monitoring the measures .
I should like to say the following on the proposed amendments : firstly , as far as the criteria for selecting the eligible products are concerned - this concerns Amendments Nos 1 , 5 , 6 and 9 - we believe that these amendments are superfluous because the Commission proposal already covers these points in a more general way .
According to the Commission proposal , the products which can be selected are those which are intended for direct consumption or processing .
In just the same way , organic products or products made using other specific production methods may be selected , as can processed foodstuffs , provided that the information and promotional measures are of sufficient benefit and are in the European interest .
As regards the nature and content of the measures to be supported , I can accept Amendment No 7 .
The more precise statement of the target groups at which the measures should be directed , analysed in Amendment No 8 , does not , however , seem to me to be necessary .
As far as your proposed adjustments to the procedure for drawing up the list of products and the question of how long this should remain valid are concerned - this relates to Amendments Nos 10 , 11 and 14 - this might pose problems if we still want our policy to be sufficiently flexible and if we also want to keep it up to date at all times .
I actually think it would be better to consult the Standing Group on the Promotion of Agricultural Products - as it is called - from the very outset , if time allows , and also for the lists we draw up to remain valid for no longer than two years .
Introducing such rigid rules , as proposed in the amendments , could prevent our policy from having the best possible effect .
Your proposal only to work with those organisations which represent exclusively the Member States of the European Union or to which at least two Member States belong is not one I can accept , because we also attach great importance to working with international organisations , which of course have to show an appropriate European dimension .
You only have to think of the work of the Olive Oil Council .
As regards the obligation to consult the relevant management committee rather than simply to inform it , I am willing to examine this proposal in more detail .
I have to reject the remaining points , however , because our experience has shown that programmes should not run for longer than three years , and because when we implement this scheme we want to adopt a bottom-up approach .
In addition , the professional organisations have to obtain the prior agreement of the national authorities before they submit their proposals to the Commission .
Obviously , the proposer organisations may also appoint bodies to be responsible for implementing the planned measures .
It must be clear , however , that these bodies must be selected on the basis of an invitation to tender at Community level .
I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 , 4 , 15 , 19 and 24 on the tendering procedure , because the Commission believes that external support facilities must be selected on the basis of an invitation to tender , so as to ensure maximum transparency of Community interests .
We also think that the Member States should have sole responsibility for monitoring and making payments , in so far as measures are to be prefinanced by them .
On your request to show more flexibility when determining the part of the funding to be paid by the Member States and in certain cases not to require any financial contribution at all - this is expressed in Amendments Nos 22 and 21 - I should like to say that I think that the Commission proposal is more balanced here in terms of the financial contributions of the three parties involved , namely the Community , the Member State and the proposer organisation .
On the proposal to increase the appropriations , as contained in Amendment No 22 , I should like to say that a substantial increase would not be acceptable at the present time because the sums spent on export refunds are in no way linked to the promotion policy , since the proposal we are discussing primarily concerns quality products and products displaying high added value .
But obviously here the ultimate decision rests with the budgetary authority .
I now turn to the comments made by Mr Colino Salamanca concerning imports of garlic from third countries .
The Commission is currently investigating the possibilities open to it within the WTO for resolving the problems in the garlic sector and is also preparing to introduce a new system which provides for an appropriately high rate of duty on all garlic imports , with the exception of imports falling within the proposed tariff quotas .
In accordance with GATT rules , quotas would have to be set on the basis of average imports from third countries over a previous three-year period and allow for an appropriate annual increase .
A draft recommendation for a Council decision authorising the Commission to hold negotiations with the third countries concerned about this change in the bound rate of duty is currently being prepared .
In the meantime , as an initial measure , the safeguard clause , which exists in principle and which we have applied in recent years , is being further extended .
Proposals have already been made on this .
I discussed both these possibilities in detail with representatives of the garlic industry a few weeks ago , and in principle they also gave the green light here and signalled their agreement .
Applause
Mr Fischler , I have to say that I let you speak for 22 minutes . However , I believe this is justified when Commissioners have to reply to a number of reports which deal with many aspects of a subject , and because many important events have taken place in this area in recent times , not least in view of the interim agreement reached by the ministers and the decisions taken at the summit .
I would like to ask the House to let me depart from the standard practice of the Chair , so as to add my comments to what Mr Fischler has said on the departure of Mr Happart .
For many years , Mr Happart has been one of the more lively elements in the European Parliament .
Those of us who have followed his activities will feel very sad that he will not be with us next time .
We wish him every success in his career and in his new political endeavours .
Mr President , if I may , Commissioner , I will echo your words of farewell to Mr Happart .
The fact is - and this is one of our colleague 's attributes - that those who swim against the tide sometimes introduce rather more oxygen into the water .
That is what Mr Happart has done throughout his long and successful career here .
Ladies and gentlemen , where expenditure is concerned , soundness , financial stability and continuity are of great importance , and in recent years - we can almost go back to the beginning of the European Union - they have not always been valued as much as we in the European Parliament , as representatives of the taxpayer , would have liked .
One of the major successes of the Berlin summit was , for the first time in fact , to move this self-evident truth to centre stage .
That is a success .
However , there is another side , a darker side , to almost every success , and in this case the politicians in the Member States are not yet aware of it .
To be cautious about this , I should like to express it as follows : alongside this stability , social justice and solidarity with the weaker members of society must of course also be key features of this policy , not only at European level but also right down to each individual locality .
One of the things which disappoints my group and me personally is that at the present time there is still no instrument - and this could have been decided on in Berlin - through which greater justice and a higher degree of solidarity with smaller and weaker farmers might be achieved .
It is painful to observe that there is currently no instrument to prevent the old principle from applying whereby price increases mean that more is given to the rich , while all that remains for the poor are the crumbs which fall from the table .
In fact , it is not so much pricing as extending the second pillar of the integrated policy in rural areas which can be one of the ways of really providing help , and not least an opportunity of moving into a different sector for those who are evidently exposed to risk as businessmen and farmers .
This opportunity must also be open to their successors .
That is our social democratic creed ; that is what we believe to be essential .
Although you also complimented Mr JovÃ© Peres , Commissioner , I do have to say that his proposals are somewhat premature .
Of course , Parliament often points the way ahead and some people - yourself excluded perhaps - then go down that road rather hesitantly .
I hope , however , that the ideas which Mr JovÃ© Peres has presented here today will actually also be translated into practical policy in the future .
What this is really about - and in this respect all these reports belong together - is gradually dismantling this rigid market segment , this regulation down to every last detail , and going back to a free social market economy in the European Union .
That is why it is obviously necessary to use our common sense to refocus the marketing initiatives undertaken very successfully by many producer groups in many countries of the European Union and to make it possible for them to sell anything they have that still needs to be sold .
Only here too there is another side to the coin : it will not do for farmers to sell potatoes to the producer group when times are hard , and for them to distribute the potatoes on the open market when times are good and they can obtain a good price .
That would mark the end of this help , this effective help of marketing .
Of course this is also about marketing .
Mr Fantuzzi 's report also contains proposals to give greater support to marketing in the European Union .
It is quite astonishing that when it comes to marketing , the economic giant of the European Union is still in its infancy and is faced with the task of trying , with a very small budget , to emulate the marketing pioneers and giants .
We need a robust marketing campaign here .
Unfortunately , good things cost money .
We need to build on what we have at regional level .
The economic giant , the EU , has to be a marketing giant as well !
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am not going to talk about the CAP reform negotiated in Berlin until tomorrow , in the debate on the summit 's conclusions .
I just want to say that I share the Commission 's disappointment about this reform , expressed at its first plenary meeting after the Berlin summit .
As mentioned at this meeting , the annual price packages were in the past the main instrument for defining agricultural policy .
It is since the 1992 reform that the price packages have gradually ceased to be this policy-defining instrument . This is due to Commissioner Fischler who , since the start of his term of office , has consistently advocated the desirability of the common agricultural policy being increasingly defined by medium-term horizons .
We now have this reform for 1999 before us in which , once again , agricultural policy is defined according to a medium-term horizon , in this case of seven years .
However , in the future the price packages will basically be used to adjust agricultural policy measures during the medium-term horizon .
With regard to this 1999-2000 price package , it is clear to everyone that this has no role to play in defining agricultural policy . It is only a bridge between the past and the future , a transitional measure preserving the status quo until the new CAP is applied at the beginning of next year .
If we are to have any sense of responsibility , there is therefore no point in proposing new measures , in particular price increases , when the Agriculture Council has just unanimously reduced these same prices within Agenda 2000 .
If the European Parliament were now to approve these measures , quite frankly it would lose its credibility .
The PPE Group cannot therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Happart nor those tabled by other Members in this respect .
However , I must congratulate Mr Happart on some of his analyses which are apposite , particularly with regard to the pigmeat sector .
I also want to thank him for all his work and cooperation with us during his time in this House . I wish him every personal and political success in the future .
Mr President , first of all I should like to join in thanking Mr Happart .
I think he has been a good friend to agriculture and the countryside and many others share my view , even if I do not always see eye to eye with him .
Instead , I support the Liberals on this issue , in other words the Commission 's proposal for the most part rather than the amendments .
Since the Berlin summit , the immediate future for farmers in terms of agricultural policy looks brighter than the Commission had previously envisaged .
However , there are a few points I should like to raise .
In making savings , agriculture should not be the target of any economies that are required as a condition for eastward enlargement .
The countryside , agriculture and other neglected areas should never have to pay for enlargement ; it should fall to those sectors which can best afford it .
For the same reason , there should be no renationalisation of agriculture .
Until there is a fully functioning global market , the CAP needs to be safeguarded .
And there is a strong likelihood that it will be some time before the market functions reliably .
I also agree with Mr Fischler 's comments to the effect that European agriculture should not become Americanised .
However , we should be aware that in the slightly longer term , the significance of the market and competition will increase .
As a result , European agriculture will have to become more efficient in terms of quantity and possibly even more so as regards quality .
In this context , I should like to say that what emerges from Mr Fantuzzi 's report about endeavouring to increase sales is constructive .
Agriculture should be something that Europe can rely on , and we should be able to feel confident about its capacity to provide food products that will be profitable in the long run .
Finally , we must give the right signals to farmers .
We should lose no time in initiating a discussion on a more far-reaching reform of our agriculture and rural policies , not on the grounds of enlargement , but because it is needed .
It is time to make changes which will last well beyond the year 2006 .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our debate on the agricultural reports and the question for oral answer cannot be kept separate from the conclusions of the Berlin agreement on CAP reform and from our assessment of this agreement .
In one sense this agreement is positive as , due to the mobilisation of farmers and the rural world , the Heads of State and Government refused to apply the extreme ultraliberal measures prepared by the Commission .
However , on the whole , the European leaders did not abandon the logic of allowing agricultural prices to fall , as imposed by the major European and international economic and financial operators .
This logic can be seen in the Commission 's regulation on prices for agricultural products . This regulation does not even guarantee that prices will be maintained in line with inflation or will compensate for the abandonment of the green ecu .
It also does not correct the imbalances occurring between products and between producers . This logic of allowing prices to fall can also be seen in the lack of determination and means to defend products such as garlic which is the victim of practices which contravene our regulations .
Yet this is a vital product for employment in the European production areas .
We therefore need a policy to promote our agricultural products , provided that this has adequate financial resources , unlike the current proposals .
It does not take a genius to predict that the logic of allowing agricultural prices to fall , as adopted in Berlin , will perpetuate a system of production which destroys employment , food quality and the environment .
However , the introduction of some negative measures in the CAP reform is to be staggered , which gives farmers , rural dwellers and the people of Europe time to demand that the CAP be genuinely reoriented in the direction defined by this House .
This is even more of a possibility as we move towards the European elections which will give the people the chance to take part in the debate and decisions .
I believe there is still work to be done on the CAP reform and the content of this policy can and must be reformed .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Happart 's stance is perfectly normal .
He has always defended production and naturally does not always submit to the limitations imposed by financial policy .
Obviously , this view of general stability may seem outrageous and blasphemous but I understand and support it .
There is no doubt that the 1992 reform , which was based on historical production rates , created a sharp difference in aid throughout Europe , particularly between rich Europe and poor Europe .
There is no doubt that the ' compensation aid ' , which will now be called ' direct aid ' , does not compensate for the fall in prices .
There is no doubt that farmers are earning less , except in the case of industrialised agriculture .
I do not therefore feel that Mr Happart 's proposal is so outrageous or so blasphemous .
It is a normal proposal from someone who is trying to defend producers as well as consumers .
My group therefore supports the proposal .
What Mr JovÃ© Peres says in his report is extremely important .
It is particularly essential to maintain the balance between producer organisations and producers and to guarantee that the latter can remain faithful to their organisations without this constituting a kind of controlled economy in which they are forced , like slaves , to sell to poorly managed organisations .
The main problem facing us is how to ensure the proper management of these organisations and , at the same time , meet the needs of producers .
I cannot agree more on the subject of withdrawal .
This often provides a large profit because it is frequently implemented fraudulently in that payment is made for products to be withdrawn which are then sold on external markets .
I have seen this happen !
The promotion of products as indicated in the Fantuzzi report is extremely important .
We have been asking for this for ages and it clearly seems ridiculous that Europe has not taken a more aggressive stance given the gradual loss of our international markets .
For example , Portugal has lost the olive oil market in Brazil to products of terrible quality against which we can easily compete .
Finally , garlic is a normal problem .
We believe that , in view of the organised crime and laundering which the Commission has allowed in recent years , in this case strict control would solve the problem .
There is a desire to control what we import .
Mr President , I must also congratulate Mr Happart . His work has always been efficient and consistent and he has also sometimes acted as a necessary irritant to this House .
With regard to his report , the Commission 's proposal to leave agricultural prices unchanged for the next season has come at a time when agricultural income has fallen considerably in certain Member States , which the Commission acknowledges .
We therefore clearly understand the rapporteur 's amendments which aim to adjust prices in line with the rate of inflation and in particular to compensate for the negative effects of a new agri-monetary system resulting from the changeover to the euro .
I fully understood the Commissioner 's position just now .
However , we will support the rapporteur 's proposal on two express conditions .
Firstly , the price adjustment must apply to all agricultural products and not just cereals , sugar and beet , butter and skimmed-milk powder and adult bovine animals .
Secondly , the increase resulting from this proposal must benefit the 80 % of farmers who are the most disadvantaged .
This is the aim of my amendment to the recitals which I have tabled on behalf of my group .
With regard to Mr Fantuzzi 's report , this proposal is much more important than it seems at first sight .
In view of the changes in the world agricultural trade , it is clearly imperative that the European Union implements a common action policy to promote and provide information on its products in third countries .
In order to sell our products , and to sell them well , as shown by the specific case of olive oil , Europe must be united and must develop its own model of agriculture . Its products must focus on quality , the protection of the environment and the maintenance of land and farmers .
Given that our main commercial competitor - the United States of America - spends approximately EUR 140 million per year on promotion , not to mention indirect aid , the Commission 's proposal to allocate EUR 15 million to the promotion of agricultural products is derisory .
This is why we support the rapporteur 's proposal to increase this figure to EUR 50 million between now and 2003 .
In line with the positions which I have always defended with my group and with other Members in order to make our European model of agriculture consistent and real , it is vital that the amendments are supported as they are intended , first of all , to make the professional organisations and the Commission jointly responsible for implementing this promotion policy . Secondly , they are intended to monitor the use of funds by providing for post-evaluation audits of spending in relation to objectives in order to judge their effectiveness and to reorient these funds if necessary .
Thirdly and finally , they aim to include within this approach aid for the promotion of quality products , for example those originating from organic farming .
Finally , our group supports the report by Mr JovÃ© Peres .
Mr President , Commissioner , a few days ago the Agriculture Committee decided that Mr Happart 's draft report on agricultural prices could not be adopted as it was .
A few moments ago , Commissioner Fischler rejected outright all the amendments which could potentially alter the Berlin agreements . It should be remembered that these agreements were reached without the European Parliament giving an opinion on them .
There is therefore nothing left for me to do but congratulate Mr Happart on having been willing and courageous enough to realistically attempt to defend the profitability of agricultural holdings .
This is why , on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations , I participated in the tabling of amendments on an across-the-board increase in institutional prices and aid of 1.9 % . The aim of these amendments is to compensate for the effects of inflation and of the green ecu being abolished from 1 January 1999 .

I did in fact table these amendments last year when I was rapporteur on the price package .
Like Mr Happart , I thought that the dual effect of inflation and the abolition of the green ecu would cause an unacceptable fall in prices for farmers given that we were also imposing constraints on them in terms of the environment , animal welfare , traceability and so on .
The fall in prices and in agricultural compensation will end up forcing farmers towards greater intensification when all they want to do is balance their budgets .
In addition to these two sets of amendments , I have tabled amendments with Mr Chesa on wine-growing .
In anticipation of a future reform of COM 1 , it is essential to set up the mechanisms specified in this in order to prevent any breakdown .
These amendments involve extending the duration of planting rights , allowing planting in advance and providing for new planting rights in order to respond to market changes .
I deeply regret this situation which will unfortunately prevent a balance being achieved in European agriculture and between each Member State .
Mr President , as everyone else has already congratulated Mr Happart , I will refrain from doing so as well .
Rather than concentrating on the issue of prices , on which we all agree with Mr Happart 's struggle , I wish to focus on an issue which I feel is symbolic in this joint discussion . This issue is garlic .
It is symbolic not just because it is a product like olive oil or wine which is subject to replanting rights and not just because it is representative of an era of civilisation , but also because it serves to demonstrate , like honey and other products , what European construction is really about .
This is a well-known issue .
We produce garlic in Europe , in the Cuenca region of Castile in Spain and in the DrÃ´me and Gers regions of France . This is quality garlic whose cultivation is ecological in two respects .
Firstly it requires little water and secondly it can be grown in problem areas thereby helping to ensure that people remain in these areas .
Our producers should therefore be protected by customs duties and controls .
However , in addition to traditional imports from Egypt , Argentina and the United States , we also receive imports from China which has a quota of twelve thousand tonnes .
Yet in reality thirty thousand tonnes are imported from China via countries involved in garlic fraud such as , dare I say , Malaysia - which sends us hundreds of tonnes without growing any itself - India , Jordan and a whole range of other third countries .
Both the official and illegal Chinese garlic leaves China at 10 centimes per kilo .
It arrives in Europe at 4.50 francs per kilo which is 0.70 euro , whereas our producers can only produce it for 10 francs per kilo which is approximately 1.5 euro .
This garlic is then offered to consumers at 3 euro or 20 francs per kilo .
In other words , our producers are facing unfair competition from garlic produced at half the cost , quite obviously by prisoners in labour camps .
What is the Commission doing while all this is going on ?
It is considering referring the matter to the World Trade Organisation following on from its success in the banana dispute .
No controls are being applied at the frontiers even though the Italians have shown that these can intercept the immigrant or , dare I say it , fraudulent garlic .
The Netherlands and the United Kingdom , who are involved in these illegal imports , are being allowed to continue . Customs duties are not being imposed whereas the United States applies 376 % customs duties to imported garlic .
Like the honey adulterated with sugar cane , beet or corn syrups and many other imports , we are allowing adulterated garlic to be imported which can be up to two years old , thus leading to germination problems .
We are allowing our producers to be destroyed , as with the banana producers in Guadeloupe , the Canary Islands , Martinique and Madeira and our wine producers .
Prices are falling and inflation is being ignored .
This is what European construction is really about , Mr President and Commissioner .
Once again , the circle of stars on the European Union flag is blinding us to a world trade involving leniency and fraud . This really is internationalism .
Mr President , I would like to begin by expressing my disappointment at the outcome of the Berlin summit .
It is difficult to discuss these matters without also seeing them in the light of what actually happened in Berlin .
Compared with the Commission 's proposal , which we supported , Berlin was in fact a disaster for European agriculture .
Things we have been working on for a number of years were not completed , and prices were not cut sufficiently .
I am unhappy about that .
I agree with those who have expressed regret that Mr Happart will no longer be here , but I would also like to tell Mr Happart that unfortunately I disagree with him - as he is well aware - about this price proposal .
It is clear that the idea behind the report was to ensure the best possible terms for farmers .
But I believe we have to recognise the fact that we should have brought our agricultural prices down to a level which reflects the world market price , and so we will have to find other methods to compensate for the social distortion which may result .
Next I would like to say a few words about Mr Fantuzzi 's report on measures to promote our agricultural products in third countries .
This is an important area in connection with both Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming WTO negotiations .
We are sympathetic towards the Commission 's move , but we believe that the favouritism shown to the olive oil sector is untenable in relation to all the other products which we would also like to sell on the world market .
To use 40 % of the budget on this sector is perhaps a little excessive .
However , we cannot endorse the proposal on national cofinancing .
I do not in fact consider it appropriate to have national cofinancing , because it entails a risk of differential treatment between countries and increases the trend towards a repatriation of common policies .
That is why I believe that general promotional measures should be financed in full by the Union , and far more funding should be allocated for this than has been proposed by the Commission .
We also support the rapporteur on this point .
It is important for us to have an effective instrument to promote exports and react to US measures in this area .
A fact which has also been pointed out by others in this debate is that the USA spends far more money on promoting exports than the Commission is planning to do here .
However , where more specific sales promotions are concerned , I think that the private companies and producer organisations involved should also participate in the financing .
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to congratulate Mr JovÃ© .
True to his record , he has once again presented us with a report which is not only technically accurate and thorough but also well balanced from a political point of view .
The changes to Regulation No 2200 / 96 establishing the COM of the fruit and vegetable sector may initially appear minor , yet certain aspects of them do give cause for concern .
A central feature of the COM as it was set up in 1996 was the key role of the producer organisations in terms of both marketing their members ' produce and regulating the markets financing withdrawal operations .
The Commission is now proposing to allow members of producer organisations to sell part of their produce outside the commercial circuits of the producer organisations to which they belong .
We agree with the rapporteur that such authorisation - doubtless intended to ensure the survival of traditional practices - should not have a negative effect on the operation of the producer organisations . This is particularly critical when allowing direct sales both on the farm and elsewhere .
Producers can directly access commercial circuits outside those of the producer organisation .
Parliament does not object to a certain amount of flexibility , but we must ensure that the main role of the producer organisations is not eroded .
I therefore welcome the differentiated quantitative limits set by the rapporteur depending on whether the sales take place on the farm or elsewhere .
I feel that these measures will ensure that the bulk of production continues to be marketed through the producer organisations . Exceptions will remain exceptions and will not become a general rule that weakens the system .
As regards the modifications to Regulation No 2202 / 96 providing for aid to citrus fruit producers , the measures introduced by the Commission are indeed sorely needed to compensate for the delay in the receipt of aid . The Commission is therefore to be congratulated on dealing with the situation .
Unfortunately , the Commission has failed to address the major shortcoming of the COM : the imbalance between the thresholds set for the processing of citrus fruits and production reality . This has resulted in significant increases in withdrawals given the heavy penalties incurred for exceeding the thresholds .
The rapporteur has suggested increasing the thresholds to the average amount processed during recent years . The financial implications are reasonable and could be covered under the COM 's financial statement .
He has also suggested setting a 20 % limit on penalties . This could help to stabilise the future of the processing industry by preventing the producers from breaking their contracts and directing their produce to withdrawal which would naturally have a negative effect on the environment and the common dimension of the COM .
Commissioner , if Mr JovÃ© 's proposals prove to be reasonable and well balanced , and if there are no technical objections , there is no sense in waiting for an eventual reform of the COM .
Instead , the proposals should be implemented immediately , taking advantage of the fact that these regulations are currently being reviewed .
In my view , what is important is not where ideas come from but whether they are fundamentally sound .
On this occasion , Mr JovÃ© has presented us with significant alternatives which could easily be implemented in view of their low cost and sound technical basis .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the average income of farmers in Portugal has continually and systematically shrunk in recent years , particularly between 1996 and 1998 .
The official statistics prove that farmers now earn just over half of what they earned three years ago .
This is the concrete and dramatic effect of the famous 1992 CAP reform on the weakest farming sector in the European Union .
This situation should have been corrected by the European Council in Berlin but unfortunately was not , with the incredible acquiescence and even approval of the Portuguese Government .
As a result of the Berlin agreement , prices will continue to fall , the weakest Mediterranean products and farmers will continue to be discriminated against and the smallest farmers in Portugal will continue to receive the scraps of the financial transfers allocated to Portugal . This means that less than 10 % of the cake will continue to be distributed to more than 90 % of those actually working the land .
As a result of the Berlin agreement , the big food industries , the large European farmers and the main cereal crops will continue to be favoured and to receive the lion 's share of the Community 's agriculture budget .
The Berlin agreement is simply continuing the 1992 CAP reform which was not altered at the end of March when it should have been .
In this context , the Commission is trying to bring forward the Berlin decisions and is proposing further price reductions for next season .
We therefore feel it is useful to support the attempt by the rapporteur - who we congratulate - to block these reduction proposals , although we consider that the fair and across-the-board increase which he is proposing , despite applying to all sectors , will still not solve the existing discriminations .
I must briefly mention the pigmeat sector .
It is clear that one of the reasons for the grave crisis which has affected and which is continuing to affect this sector has been the Commission 's refusal to establish market regulation and intervention mechanisms . These would over time have prevented the accumulation of such large surpluses .
The Commission should draw the respective and requisite conclusions from this and accordingly not insist on , or even abandon , its proposals to abolish market intervention mechanisms in other agricultural sectors .
Commissioner , the price package for 1999 / 2000 is being fixed at a decisive time for the future of European agriculture when farmers ' income is continuing to shrink .
In 1997 and 1998 , their income fell by 6.5 % overall .
The fall in market prices which began in 1998 is continuing in 1999 and the prospects on the world market remain uncertain in some sectors .
The abolition of the green rates and the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 have resulted in a fall of 1 % to 2 % in the agricultural conversion rates in each Member State .
It is now clear that the Commission 's proposal on the price package is still paltry and gives farmers little room for manoeuvre .
We must clearly reaffirm the benefits of agriculture in terms of the economy , self-sufficiency in food production , which is its primary function , and occupation of the land .
We must maintain a prosperous and successful agricultural sector and , in particular , we must prevent the disappearance of certain categories of farmers due to falling income .
We must not allow agriculture to be taken over by bureaucracy due to an increase in public aid as this would restrict farmers ' freedom of action .
Dare we say that European agriculture has a cost which cannot be reduced any further without calling into question our model of agriculture .
Furthermore , European consumers benefit from this model because they are assured of quality products and a regular market supply .
We have also been able to develop the products from our land and the products from organic farming .
Our agri-food industry also represents a high value added .
In twenty years , the price of a metric quintal of wheat has fallen by 40 % whereas production costs have increased by 20 % and more in certain sectors .
It is therefore not difficult to understand why European farmers are worried about their futures .
The European Union 's role is not to sacrifice its agriculture on the altar of enlargement or Americanisation but to allow our farmers to carry out their work and to have a standard of living equal to the average in Europe .
This is why I will support Mr Happart 's amendments . I also wish him every success in his new work .
Mr President , I welcome this opportunity this morning to speak on the situation regarding agriculture within the European Union and the effects of present policy and of the recent decisions at the Berlin Summit .
To some extent prices have very little effect on the farmer 's actual future , because while we sit and talk about prices and say there will be no inflationary aspects , in the final analysis it is the actual income to the farmer that is important .
If we look at statistics throughout Europe over the last two to three years , we can see that actual income to the farmer on the ground has dramatically dropped .
Every year the income drops .
The question we have to ask ourselves is how long can this continue ?
How long can agriculture sustain itself in this position ?
The other question we have to ask is : will there be any future for the industry if young people do not continue to enter agriculture ?
That is the long-term challenge .
If we do not have young people coming into agriculture - young farmers beginning at the bottom of the ladder to work their way up - then in the longer term agriculture has no future , long-term or short-term .
To some extent what we are involved in at the moment in Europe is short-term policies that have no long-term vision .
We require long-term vision for the future , for the future of agriculture .
There are also areas within European agriculture that are not covered by any regime , such as the situation in the pig industry and the situation in the poultry industry .
We are allowing imports to come from third countries outside the European Union ; we are allowing food to be imported into Europe that would not come near European standards .
At the same time we are laying down standards , we are telling our farmers how they should produce food .
We are tying farmers ' hands behind their backs .
Frozen chickens are being imported from Brazil and from the Far East .
I challenge the Commission here today to tell us whether these chickens are being examined and whether they meet the same standards as we have ?
Our processors are being put at risk .
This is why there is high unemployment .
Our processors are being put out of business .
I challenge the Commission here today .
Let us look at ourselves , let us not ask our farmers in Europe to produce food to a standard that others in the rest of the world cannot match .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the difficulties facing European agriculture are sufficiently well known .
They are of course being discussed at this very moment .
Small-scale farmers have problems competing directly with factory farms overseas .
I am favourably disposed towards the idea of selling more quality products from European agriculture on the world markets by means of the measures proposed in the Fantuzzi report .
However , as with all support policies , two points need to be taken into account here .
Firstly , we must ensure that no new bureaucratic bodies are created .
There is already a proliferation of forums and committees .
I am therefore critical of the proposal to arrange our own trade visits .
It begs the question of whether associations already in existence might not be able to perform this task .
Secondly , the financial burden and the risk must not be borne predominantly by the public sector .
Only if the operators also bear a considerable proportion of the costs will sensible projects be implemented without public money being wasted .
That is why the amendment stating that the Community should pay 60 % of the costs in each case rather than a maximum of 50 % is not acceptable .
Overall , I believe that the measures will unlock new sales potential for our farmers .
I therefore support the Commission proposal .
Mr President , I should like to start by saying that 15 minutes ago there were still no amendments in English to two of the reports despite your assurances at 9 o 'clock that there would be some within a couple of minutes .
I turn now to the price package .
I am afraid I cannot support the rapporteur 's amendments calling for price increases across the board .
Yes , many farmers are struggling at the moment , but large , richer farmers , though profits are down , are very far from the breadline .
The extra expenditure is not justified overall and these amendments go against the whole thrust of the CAP reforms agreed in Berlin .
More appropriate would be temporary special measures to assist particular sectors to survive through short-term difficulties .
Mr Fantuzzi 's report on the marketing of EU produce to third countries , mirroring similar schemes within the EU , is one such instance which could assist .
I wish to welcome the proposals on fruit and vegetables , in particular the move to allow up to 20 % of produce to be sold directly to consumers at the farm gate or through farmers ' markets .
In the UK in particular , the large supermarket chains are gaining ever greater control of producers , insisting from a semi-monopoly position that their suppliers conform exactly to their requirements .
There has been a reaction against this .
We have seen the growth of farmers ' markets and the demand from consumers for less standardised fruit and vegetables in terms of size , seeking rather flavour and freshness at prices which provide a good deal for both producer and consumer .
I therefore particularly welcome this proposal .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , ever since agricultural policy was converted into a price support system in the agricultural reform of 1992 to 1994 , agricultural debates have in fact lost much of their charm .
That is why I should like to focus on the future .
Mr JovÃ© Peres 's excellent report also talks about controlled and integrated cultivation .
I have a very clear request to make to the Commission here : this method of agricultural production is a very good one and deserves to be supported because it takes account of the environment and heeds consumers ' wishes .
However , its impact and the form it takes vary across the Member States .
Integrated cultivation is not the same thing in each Member State , and that is why we need uniform directives on the integrated and controlled cultivation of fruit and vegetables to be transposed in the Member States .
However , I should now like to turn to the rural development programme - the second pillar of the new agricultural policy - and say the following : the remarkable feature of this programme is the variety of measures for farmers and rural areas .
Nevertheless , I do have a question for the Commissioner .
The risk here is cofinancing .
How can we guarantee that it will be possible to bring these programmes - which are really good for rural areas - to the people , when governments are refusing to proceed with cofinancing ?
Early retirement for farmers , the setting-up premium for young farmers and modernising agricultural holdings to reduce production costs , for example , are extremely important measures , and I should like to welcome the fact that they are presented here in a separate rural development pillar .
But there is still the risk that if cofinancing is not guaranteed by the Member States , then how are the people who live in areas of this kind going to benefit from these programmes , which are undoubtedly valuable , but which cannot be implemented if they are not taken up by the Member States ?
I have one final question for you : in Germany , can the BundeslÃ¤nder also act as treaty partners , so that the programmes can at least be implemented in those LÃ¤nder which are prepared to provide cofinancing ?
The debate is suspended at this point ; it will be resumed this afternoon .
We shall now hear a statement by the nominee for President of the Commission , Mr Romano Prodi .
Statement by Mr Prodi , nominee for President of the Commission
The next item is the statement by Mr Prodi , nominee for President of the Commission , followed by a debate between the political groups , without a final resolution .
I therefore give the floor to the nominee for President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , whom I would also welcome to the House .
Mr Prodi , you have the floor .
Loud applause
Thank you , Mr Prodi .
I give the floor to Mrs Green .
Mr President , on behalf of my Group , I wish to welcome Mr Prodi here today .
His nomination by the European Council came swiftly and decisively in the wake of the resignation of the present Commission , and my Group welcomed the speed with which the Council responded .
We had urged the Heads of Government in Berlin to act quickly to end the uncertainty and confusion which followed the unprecedented resignation of the 20 present Commissioners .
We welcomed the Council 's clear understanding of the political nature of the moment and of the opportunity it offered to create a new relationship between the European Union institutions and its citizens .
It could not have acted more quickly and , it has to be said , that it acted with uncharacteristic speed .
Mr Prodi 's statement to us here this morning is the beginning of our ratification process of the new Commission .
My Group wants the new European Commission to come into office as soon as possible .
It must be said that the timetable which the European Council has set us is not an easy one .
Given the European elections in June , given the imminent introduction of the Amsterdam Treaty and given the convergence of general elections in two of our Member States on the same day as the European elections , the timetable presents us with a logistic headache of monumental proportions .
However , we must find a way around the problems .
All of us in this House want to see the present Commission leave office as soon as possible .
To be fair to them , they too have expressed a desire to leave as soon as possible .
They remain in office only as a caretaker Commission , as the Treaty obliges them to do . It is a situation unloved by them and grossly unsatisfactory to us .
To carry out our role now with regard to the next Commission , we may have to put our own parliamentary calendar and personal diaries under considerable strain .
So be it .
The conclusions of the Berlin Summit asked this Parliament to deal with the nomination of Mr Prodi and the new Parliament to deal with the ratification of the entire new Commission .
We insist , however , that the ratification of the next President of the Commission must be done rigorously , seriously and properly by this Parliament .
I welcome very much Mr Prodi 's consent to come here today and begin that process in that spirit .
The role of this Parliament in recent events has been fundamental .
It is important that we now demonstrate our maturity and see the process through to its conclusion .
My Group believes that now , together with the Council and a reforming Commission , we can set up a structure and decision-making process which is more appropriate , more in tune with modern governance .
First and foremost , we want a strong Commission .
The new Commission must have clear direction , a firm political leadership which is open , it must practise genuine transparency and partnership with the European Parliament and not just pay lip-service to those values .
None of us here underestimate the problems and challenges of creating such a European Commission .
However , I want to make clear to Mr Prodi today , on behalf of my Group , that if the next Commission makes a genuine attempt to reform with the courage and vigour which he has expressed this morning , then it will receive the support of my Group .
My Group will not play toy-town politics with this process .
We would not do it in January of this year and we will not do it now .
Mixed reactions

Some in this House welcomed Mr Prodi to Parliament ; some in this House seem determined to play solely national electoral politics with this issue , ignoring the importance of the moment for Europe , for its policies and for its people .
Mixed reactions
Those concerned for the evolution of this House as the real democratic voice of Europe 's people will work together to enhance its role and its rights , which is what our citizens are waiting and watching for .
My experience during the last few weeks campaigning in Britain has been that , for the first time ever , people know that the European Parliament exists as a force to be reckoned with - not just the subject of myths about curly cucumbers and curved bananas - but a body which has delivered objective evidence through the report of the Committee of Independent Experts and then acted on it .
My Group takes considerable pride in our role over recent months .
Mixed reactions
We believe that we have acted in the best traditions of parliamentarians : responsible , exercising leadership and acting with integrity .
Mixed reactions
Mr Prodi , you have come to this House today as the Council 's designated candidate .
You come with excellent credentials as a good European and a proven track record of personal integrity , the authority of having held the highest office of the land in one of the largest Member States of the European Union and one of the founding states at that .
You have demonstrated your ability to put together a reforming government and develop a consensus with all sectors of Italian society , to ensure that Italy was able and ready to enter the first wave of the single currency .
In this you have confounded the sceptics .
Hopes in this Parliament of just what you could achieve with those formidable skills as President of the European Commission are high .
I believe , therefore , that when you come to this Parliament next month , we would like to hear some clear idea of the direction you will take on two fronts .
It must be said that you began that statement in a very clear and very strong way here this morning , and we very much welcome that .
Firstly , given the trauma which led to the collapse of the present Commission , we expect to hear a clear commitment - not just to implementing the programme of reforms already agreed by this Parliament and the current Commission in January and the subsequent agreement on the independent investigatory body OLAF - but to further and deeper reforms of substance , in particular ( and I was glad to hear you mention it ) with regard to the acceptance of political and personal responsibility for work done by officials at whatever level in the European Commission .
We also expect that you will give due account to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts and work with us in Parliament to examine , assess and implement the necessary reforms .
Secondly , for my Group , the real substance of the programme of the European Commission is political .
We understand that , if your appointment is ratified , you will not be able to present a full political programme until you have negotiated with the governments on their nominations to the Commission under the new rights given to the President of the Commission by the Amsterdam Treaty .
We understand from various interviews which you have given , that you intend to use those rights to the full .
We would not only support you in doing so but would also encourage you to do so .
The new Commission must act like a college and not like 20 fiefdoms and the moulding of such a Commission will lie in the hands of the new President of the Commission .
However , for my Group the political content of the programme which will be produced by the new Commission is crucial .
Last week when you visited my Group , I presented you with our objectives for the next five years in the form of our manifesto for the European elections .
From this you will see that our agenda is for jobs , training for jobs , protection of the environment , the fight against social exclusion , the need to protect the health and safety of our citizens in a world now having to deal with issues like BSE and genetically modified foods , the struggle against cross-border crime , working together for a stronger Europe in the world and carrying out the necessary reforms to ensure that we can enlarge the Union at the earliest possible moment .
We will judge the European Commission to be established in the coming weeks on both its political programme and its programme for reform .
I for one welcome your human and intelligent development of your thinking here this morning - economic , cultural , social , based on peace .
I think all of us here very much welcome that .
Finally , I wish to touch on the issue you raised at the end of your speech .
Many in my Group feel a strong democratic affinity with the proposals of Jacques Delors that we move in the future to a position where the President of the European Commission should derive his or her credibility from the electoral process .
For this to happen there has to be agreement between the Council and Parliament on the process .
The sensitive balance between Member States and the institutions of the Union cannot be jeopardised by precipitous action which could damage the process of European integration , in which respect for differing political cultures and democratic practices are paramount .
In this respect , you , Mr Prodi , have already been unanimously nominated for the office of President of the European Commission by all the Heads of State and Government in the European Union .
You do not come to this nomination through any defining electoral process .
However , one of your great strengths is that you bring with you a great experience of success at consensus building .
It is in that context that my Group very much welcomes the statement you made today that , whilst , of course , you will engage with those with whom you are politically aligned - as we and the Commissioners have always done - we welcome your clear statement this morning that you will not stand as a candidate to this House .
We might have expected that , with just over three weeks of the life of this Parliament left to go , we might be on the gentle slope towards an election .
Usually parliaments ease their way out or drift away as legislation peters out and parliamentary life comes to an end .
In the last week of the last parliamentary term , in 1994 , we had to mobilise all outgoing Members to vote on the enlargement of the Union .
On this occasion not only do we have Agenda 2000 but also we have to face the consequences of a resigned Commission and a new President of the European Commission .
This is a serious process .
Mr Prodi , the programme you develop after this debate and your discussion tomorrow evening with the European Council represent an important step in the development of European democracy .
Applause
Mr President , as I listened to Mrs Green 's speech I felt the need to apply a brief reality check to it and to the procedures of this House .
Is this the Pauline Green who , in December , recommended that we vote confidence without even thinking ?
Applause
Is this the Pauline Green who , in January , defended collegiality ?
Is this the Pauline Green today who promotes individual accountability ? I salute her for being one of the few genuine revolutionaries in this House since , on this issue , she has never stopped spinning .
Sustained applause
I should like to say to Mr Prodi how welcome he is here today .
He is a European of the first rank .
The ELDR Group looks forward to deepening our engagement and dialogue with him , and to a very productive period for the future .
But is not for this Parliament , in this mandate , to appoint the president of the Millennium Commission .
That is the moral , political and legal responsibility of the next mandate .
Recent events have established , through the work of this House , the need to establish ethical and normative rules for the conduct of European affairs .
But this is also representative of a significant maturing in the European democratic process , with major institutional and constitutional implications .
This House will no longer be the junior partner .
We do not need to be first among equals , but we assert the right to be treated as an equal among equals .
That is why I welcome the presence of Mr Prodi at this early stage and the dialogue we start .
I should like to say to you , Mr Prodi , directly on behalf of my group , not as advice nor as an instruction but as a suggestion that you might like to think about , that you should seek in the coming days - and especially tomorrow in your dialogue with the European Council - to assert your own independence , not just of the needs of this House , but of some of the parameters of the Council itself .
I believe you are your own man .
You should assert that from the outset .
I believe you should explain to the Council that it is not appropriate that we should , in a procedure in May , elect you as the legitimate head of what would be an illegitimate Commission .
I believe you should not launch your project in such a sea of political and institutional ambiguity .
I would like to think that in May we could give you a political mandate to act as formateur , to go from this House in May to begin to explore in substance , as formateur with a political mandate , what you might do .
It would be most unfortunate if you should start in a procedure where you are legitimate in the context of a Commission as college - I speak not of individuals but of a college - which itself is discredited .
In the context of being your own man it is also correct that you should consider getting your project right rather than getting it early .
What you are dealing with is vitally important for all of us .
I note your political discretion in saying you will step down from running in the European Parliament election .
That discretion is your choice and I respect it .
But I would say to you : be engaged in that election ; maintain your political conviction ; and fight the cause with those colleagues whose list you will not now head .
In doing that you will establish that you , Romano Prodi , come to us not as a bureaucrat , not as a technician , but as someone dedicated to European politics , as a politician , and that as a politician you will lead a strong , independent political Commission .
If you decide to be your own man , to be political , then you will do us all a great favour .
Applause
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are today beginning the process , itself completely new , of appointing a new Commission . This will have the task of completing the term of office of the previous Commission which was forced to resign en masse in order to avoid a motion of censure .
There are two consequences of this unusual situation .
Firstly , a new College must be established as quickly as possible . This is because it is detrimental to leave in office for too long a weakened body which under the Treaties can only deal with current business , the limits of which are rather vague .
The various governments must appoint their Commissioners as quickly as possible so that the European Parliament can , in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty , confirm the appointment of the new College . This could take place , in the best-case scenario , during an extension of the constitutive sitting after the June elections .
Secondly , it would not be right for the process to appoint the new Commission , whose term of office will end at the end of the year , to overlap with the process initiated to establish the Commission which must be appointed to complete a normal term of five years from the year 2000 .
This overlap would have the major disadvantage of obscuring the deep-seated reasons currently prompting us to establish a new team , namely the need for large-scale and profound internal reform of the structures , procedures and working methods of the Commission .
This is perhaps not an exciting task for the nominee for President but it meets an immediate and unavoidable need .
The actions of the European Parliament which led to the resignation of the Santer team would seem senseless if this priority of sorting out the Commission institution was not fully understood by the new College .
This matter requires in-depth examination .
The Commission must refocus solely on those powers expressly conferred on it by the Treaties , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity reaffirmed by the Amsterdam Treaty .
The Commission must once again become what it was originally , namely an administration with a mission , responsible for making proposals to the political authorities of the Council and Parliament and for explaining their choices .
It must not represent the beginning of a European government invested with many poorly fulfilled management tasks .
The management of common policies must be extensively decentralised . This requires both substantial reinforcement of the control bodies and the establishment of a central anti-fraud office which is independent and has the resources needed to fulfil its mission .
In light of the conclusions to be announced by the Committee of Independent Experts , which should be available in September , the Commission must establish real internal financial control . It must also introduce professional and totally transparent procedures for awarding public contracts together with procedures for recruiting and managing staff which finally put an end to the nepotism and favouritism which recently have unfairly stained the reputation of an administration whose powers and availability are otherwise acknowledged .
Finally , a shake-up is required together with the pruning of any dead wood following the disciplinary and legal proceedings which are now in progress .
This is what we expect from you , Mr Prodi , in the coming months .
Your vision of the future of European construction is all very interesting but you must , as a priority , return to working order the institution for which you will be required to assume responsibility when your appointment has been confirmed by the European Parliament .
Applause
Mr President , our group - the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left - would like to thank Mr Romano Prodi for his presence in the House today .
In our view , the political implications are clear .
Mr Prodi does not wish to be simply the Council 's nominee for President or the governments ' President . Rather , he wishes to become the President of the people of Europe through a close relationship with the European Parliament .
The new President will be appointed at a critical stage in the construction of Europe .
Over and above the institutional crisis , we are faced with a crisis in the wider Europe .
As Mr Prodi himself pointed out , war has come to Yugoslavia 42 years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome and 10 years after the end of the cold war .
Human rights are being infringed in the Balkans , most particularly in Kosovo .
NATO has initiated military intervention .
Yet the European institutions and a sense of European identity have been absent .
Could we ever envisage managing the euro if the European Central Bank were not fully operational ?
How then can we expect European policies to operate effectively under what is merely a caretaker Commission and with Parliament almost at the end of its fourth term since 1979 ?
There is plenty of scope for debate on whether we should be aiming at more Europe or less Europe .
Personally , I am in favour of more Europe .
However , I think we all agree that we would like the existing European powers to be imbued with greater democracy , and hope that the sectoral policies will be managed more efficiently .
That is our message to the nominee and I am sure there is consensus on this .
As far as we are concerned , this new era in the history of the European Commission must be defined by four conditions or characteristics : a sound democratic basis , transparency , the Commissioners ' individual and collective political responsibility to Parliament , and effectiveness in fulfilling objectives .
In this respect , I am referring to political responsibility to a Parliament that has come of age , and this should be made abundantly clear .
Parliament is now a mature institution and will soon be embarking on its fifth term . It certainly has not transferred its powers and responsibilities to any committee of experts .
It simply asked for a report to be prepared to clarify certain situations .
I do not intend to concentrate on the responsible attitude my group has shown throughout this crisis . After all , as the old Latin saying goes , excusatio non petita , accusatio manifesta .
I would merely remind the House of the events and our response to them .
In conclusion , I should like to make it clear to Mr Prodi that we are keeping an open mind on his investiture .
We are of course already aware of his record in Italian and European politics , and we shall doubtless learn more about it . Nevertheless , our vote will be based on the programmes and objectives he presents at the investiture sitting , on the credibility of his desire for change and of the necessary proposals for reform , and on his political strategy for dealing with the difficult challenges facing European society .
We are concerned about the timetable for his appointment and the appointment of the Commission , and would like to set out our position on two issues .
Our group hopes for a swift procedure and a clear presentation of the Commissioners in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam .
We are no longer concerned about Mr Prodi 's possible candidature in the Italian elections .
He has clarified the situation very well and in a responsible manner .
Mr President , I shall finish by pointing out that in view of the serious problems concerning enlargement and our social and economic policies , our group feels that what we need is not just a President of the institutions , but a President of all the people of Europe .
Mr President , Mr Prodi , your achievements in Italy unquestionably make you a most worthy candidate , because you have done things there which no one thought possible and in the European Union you will face tasks which are every bit as difficult , if not more so .
Vaclav Havel once said ' what use are the most beautiful of buildings if they serve no purpose ? '
You have made statements in recent weeks to the effect that the European Union needs a purpose .
But what does that mean exactly ?
We think that what matters most is that you should make the Union , which is currently so remote from its people and has fallen into such disrepute as a result of mismanagement and fraud , into a democratic and transparent Union which demonstrates that it can take responsibility and is willing to answer to the people and to the elected Parliament .
Your appointment has been swift , and that is a good thing .
But the problem is that the whole of the outgoing Commission , which no longer has the confidence of Parliament and which has truly been discredited , will be staying put until September .
This , ladies and gentlemen , gives rise to a situation which is politically untenable for us and unworthy of the European Parliament .
At a time when the Union needs to be forceful , when we have a major political catastrophe in Yugoslavia and beyond , we have a lame-duck Commission .
So we are urging you , Mr Prodi , to make every effort to come before Parliament with a capable and forceful Commission as swiftly as possible .
We consider it most important that you should put forward sound proposals for reform of the European Commission which will enable it to exercise collective responsibility in a real and proper way and will also determine the individual responsibility of Commissioners and the responsibility of directors-general , because things have to change in this respect as well .
We should have liked to hear in your statement a reference to the need for radical adjustments to the European Union 's economic policy , because belief in unqualified growth ignores the absolute need to restructure our economies to take account of environmental imperatives .
We trust you will take on board Parliament 's proposal that more women should be appointed as European Commissioners , that they should be able to play their proper part in developing further something which is a part of our acquis communautaire in this context .
Lastly , we find it splendid that you have said here today that you will not be standing in the elections .
This is a political decision , worthy of a good European .
In conclusion , we would say that we are looking for a strong Commission , but a strong Commission which is happy to be accountable to a strong Parliament .
Only then can we have a new basis for trust .
Mr President , Mr President-designate , your presence here today is a very positive sign in the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty which will shortly enter into force . Our group thanks you for coming here .
During your meetings with the Members of this House , you must have realised the expectations and I would say the high hopes resting on the new Commission , in terms of both the interim Commission and , later on , the permanent Commission to be established in January 2000 .
Naturally , these hopes primarily concern the new Commission President whose role will be absolutely vital .
We are hoping for and indeed we demand a strong Commission .
This firstly requires a strong President .
The current crisis and the resignation of the outgoing Commission under pressure from Parliament have primarily been caused by the Commission 's gradual loss of authority .
Even though important work has been achieved over the last five years , for example with the single currency , this loss of authority is serious because the European Union needs a politically strong Commission .
The Commission must be strong faced with the national governments , all the more so if the number of countries increases following enlargement .
It must be strong faced with Parliament , as one of the elements of this strength is precisely its political responsibility before this House .
It must be strong faced with public opinion because the Commission , whether it likes it or not , is the very personification of the European Union .
Although this political strength is our main demand for the future Commission , we also have other demands , particularly regarding the internal working of this Commission .
Even though there are other deep-rooted causes for this situation , as I have just mentioned , the immediate cause of the crisis which prompted the outgoing Commission to resign was the problems in the organisation and working of the College of Commissioners and also in the organisation and working of the services under the authority of the Commissioners .
Questions must also be asked about the increasing number of powers entrusted to the Commission .
This increase in the number of tasks seems paradoxically to have weakened its prestige and certainly has not helped , which speaks volumes .
Mr President-designate , your work , I should say your mission , will be immense .
You have already shown in Italy that you are capable of taking it on .
I have also noted everything you have just said in your introductory speech and your concern that the democratic link between the members of the Commission and universal suffrage should be reinforced .
On behalf of my group , I hope that you will be courageous and enjoy every success !
Applause
Mr President , the Europe of Nations Group would also like to congratulate Mr Prodi on his nomination .
We regard you , Mr Prodi , as a centralist and super-federalist in favour of a United States of Europe , and we are therefore going to vote against your appointment .
We regard you as Jacques Delors the Second .
The Europe of Nations Group promises you critical and constructive opposition .
We shall be critical every time you propose a step in the direction of more Union .
We shall be constructive every time there is even the slightest chance of having greater openness in the corridors of the Commission .
What we need now is not a new Commission , but a spring clean by independent individuals who can dispense with any Commission work which is not transnational in nature and introduce complete openness for what remains .
We need a modern law on public administration , with decentralised responsibility and consequences for those who do not fulfil their responsibilities .
There should be an end to 50 years of secrecy and privilege .
Officials who came to Parliament with revelations of fraud should be reinstated on full pay , and those who obstruct investigations should be fired .
It is scandalous that the current Commission , after its resignation , has decided that Mr Van Buitenen is not allowed to help the Belgian police to investigate any of the matters which led to the Commission 's downfall .
Officials at the Commission should be servants of democracy in our countries and not new overlords .
To personal friendship and political enmity : ' Benvenuto , Signor Prodi ! '
Mr President , Mr Prodi , Alleanza Nazionale endorses the formal commitments which you are to make concerning institutional reform in the Union - which the Amsterdam Treaty unfortunately deals with in insufficient detail - and the launch of political union .
If ever proof were needed , the tragic events in Kosovo and NATO 's military intervention there demonstrate the pressing need for the European Union to adopt a common foreign and defence policy , without which it is as though Europe did not exist .
Developments over the past few days have confirmed the absence of Europe as an independent entity .
What we are experiencing now proves conclusively , as never before , the urgent need for a European political identity and a recognisable presence on the international stage , with due regard for the alliances to which we belong .
The European Council stated a long time ago that it would nominate the new Commission President before the elections .
What displeases us is that your decisions on the Italian front might have been influenced by the European left , which is seeking , somewhat surreptitiously , to prevent you from standing at the elections .
But in our opinion - turning now to Europe - a sound democratic foundation for the next Commission should enable the political groups to propose to the European Parliament their candidates for Commission President , rather than always having to react to proposals from the governments .
Therefore , Mr Prodi , we look forward to the ' age of reform and change ' which you announced in your speech , but the reforms should be real ones and not just vague proposals : a political union to reinforce the economic union , so as to have a foreign policy , to address ourselves to the Mediterranean , as you said , but also to deal with immigration and crime , as well as humanitarian aid - and here I include the agricultural products which Europe is still throwing away or not producing , to the great detriment of our economy .
GATT must be overhauled too , since despite our good relations with the United States , we cannot be held to ransom over the safeguarding of our manufactured products and our production system , while being compelled to import - duty-free - products from third countries which obviously result from dumping practices .
So , Mr Prodi , one aspect of planning the future is to demand explicit social clauses of the countries to which the EU gives aid : third countries , or indeed fourth countries , including the republics of the former Soviet Union . In this way , enlargement will not just mean a rise in poverty and unemployment , but will be based on a revival of Europe 's economy driven by quality production ; obviously , since we cannot compete on price , we must do so on quality .
The idea , then , is that the Commission and Parliament should plan the future together , reminding the Council that it cannot take all the decisions ; otherwise the European people will feel that they count for nothing .
That is how to begin planning the future !
Mr President-designate , you expressed a wish for a strong Europe .
I fear that your attitude will only contribute to the ultimate disappearance of the European Union .
You start by accepting that the provisions of the Treaty are not being correctly applied .
Article 159 requires new Commissioners to be appointed as quickly as possible .
It also requires the European Parliament to approve one Commission , which will be in place for six months , before a new Parliament approves another Commission which will remain in office for five years .
You are also preparing yourself to take on the responsibilities of the Commission President without learning the lessons from what has just happened .
The Commission - and you are surrounded by outgoing Commissioners - was challenged initially by a majority in this House which refused to grant discharge for 1996 .
The accounts for 1996 have therefore not been closed .
Whatever Mrs Green may say about ' toy-town politics ' - and actually this is just what she has been playing at throughout this year - the whole College of Commissioners , and not just one particular Commissioner , was censured by 232 votes .
The Committee of Experts was extremely severe in its report and comments , stating that none of the Commissioners should be reappointed .
If you really want a strong Europe , you must therefore be responsible for ensuring that a new Commission is established very quickly .
This Commission must implement a shake-up , it must provide a cure as far-reaching as the diagnosis and it must permanently change its working methods , without which the whole European Union will die .
Mr President , we may hear flights of rhetoric , but they can also turn into futile debates .
And now there are also flights of bombers , carrying your lethal weapons .
I must formally protest about the policy of war being conducted in Europe , supported by the European Union on the orders of the Americans !
Exclamations
This criminal policy of aggression against Serbia and its small heroic population is a violation of the UN Charter and also of the NATO Treaty . It is also a violation by France of its Constitution !
The continued bombardment of economic targets and civilian populations is one of the most cowardly and unpardonable acts in 50 years !
May God ensure that you do not turn out to be the sorcerer 's apprentices allowing a third world war to break out !
Mixed reactions
I give the floor to Mrs Green under Rule 108 .
I would remind her that she has the floor to rebut any remarks that have been made about her person in the course of the debate or opinions that have been attributed to her , or to correcting observations that she herself has made .
Mr President , I wish to make a personal statement as my name has been mentioned .
I want to say that for a British parliamentarian the cut and thrust of party politics which we heard here this morning is actually like manna from heaven and say to those who are shouting at me I actually thrive on it .
I note that the level of personal abuse towards me from the right of this House has risen as the right 's political fortunes have fallen all across the European Union .
Mixed reactions
I can accept that , and the European public are aware that it was the European People 's Party which split from top to bottom in March on the motion of censure in this House , with a majority voting the Socialist position .
Mixed reactions
Their shouting and abuse is designed to obscure that fact .
Mr Martens is fond of telling us in this House that in March his party asked for the resignation of Mrs Cresson .
He forgets to tell the House that he , and his party , also asked for the resignation of other Commissioners who were found not to be guilty by the Independent Group of Experts .
Finally , may I say to Mr Cox that his statement was in line with the cheap opportunism for which his political family is famous .
Mixed reactions
I shall give the floor to Mr Martens on the same basis , but I would ask for an end to these constant personal references , which will turn this into a never-ending issue .
You have the same right , Mr Martens , and you have the floor .
Mr President , Mrs Green has the unfortunate habit of turning a political remark into a personal one .
Applause
I would just add that in January of this year she tabled a motion of no confidence , saying that the Socialist Group would vote against .
That was the start of the crisis , and if she is criticised for that political misjudgement she should not take it as a personal comment .
Applause
As was previously agreed , Mr Prodi will reply to all these speeches during the forthcoming investiture debate .
I do not think we should interrupt the sitting . We ought really to move straight on to the votes , because as things stand at the moment , we are due to deal with 200 votes today , a further 300 tomorrow , and we are already running a quarter of an hour late .
VOTES
Parliament approved the Commission proposal
Mr President , I would like to speak to Amendment No 12 .
However , before I do that , I would like to apologise to the House .
Last night my report was called and I was not here .
I set off yesterday mid-afternoon from London City Airport .
Seventeen hours later I arrived here . To add insult to injury my suitcase was lost .
So I was deprived of my opportunity to speak to this worthwhile report which makes motoring safer for all citizens of Europe .
I am very much aware of Mr RÃ¼big 's amendment , I approve of it and I recommend to the House that we vote in favour .
It is an improvement on the amendment voted through EMAC .
Applause
I must say you are looking very glamorous this morning .
One would not have known your suitcase had not arrived .
Laughter
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
A word or two if I may , Mr President .
We noted here at yesterday 's sitting that it was the first time , in point of fact , that a report on drugs had been able to command broad support , but also that the balance should not be disturbed .
I myself have tabled an amendment , and it transpired in the debate that this might give rise to difficulties .
I would ask you to remove the word ' uncontrolled ' from the last line of Amendment No 9 , or to agree to a split vote in which people can vote for or against this word .
But I would prefer you to delete the word ' uncontrolled ' .
Parliament adopted the resolution
Mr President , we have received a document today from the services telling us what Members should do to prepare themselves for the move to the new IPE IV building .
The majority of Members have never seen the inside of the IPE IV building , though I am told that lots of people who are not Members have been taken around .
I wonder whether during the next plenary part-session arrangements could be made for those Members who would like to have a preview of the building , to be able to do so ?
I do not see any difficulty with that .
I suggest that you contact the security service if you wish to be escorted round the building .
The problem until now is that work has been continuing in the building .
I would also suggest that perhaps we could organise groups of Members to go round .
Mr President , the action plan on an area of freedom , security and justice , presented by the Austrian Presidency and adopted by the Vienna European Council in December 1998 , is quite a rigorous text . Its clear aim is to ensure that the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty are implemented in a realistic way .
The same cannot be said for the European Parliament report on this subject which has just been adopted by the House today . As usual , it seeks to put the federalist obsession before the real needs of the people .
For example , the European Council 's action plan declares from the outset that although freedom of movement is a fundamental objective of the Treaty , this must generally be assessed bearing in mind the security requirements .
According to this text , freedom involves more than the free movement of people as ' it is also freedom to live in a law-abiding environment ' .
On the subject of immigration and asylum policies , the Council text then adds that ' particular priority needs to be attached to combating illegal immigration ' .
However , the tone changes completely in the European Parliament report .
The main priority becomes , and I quote , ' a more positive definition of fundamental rights and European citizenship ' . It is as if the Member States used to be part of a semi-barbaric state where the rights of the individual were constantly being violated and where we had waited for centuries for the Eurocrats to appear and finally impose the rule of law .
Clearly , we are all being taken for half-wits .
Under these conditions , it is no surprise to see that , on matters involving the movement of people , the European Parliament regards freedom of movement as the primary Community right , whereas combating illegal immigration is buried in the middle of a list of other objectives .
Our position is obviously closer to the Council 's although we would stipulate that each Member State must retain sovereign control over its territory .
The development of the EU into an area of freedom , security and justice is extremely important for the people of Europe , and we therefore welcome the Bontempi report .
However , we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area .
Europol should merely complement and assist national police forces and not be able to take direct action against our citizens .
As regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor , we are opposed to such a move because there is no supranational cooperation on matters of criminal law .
Cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental .
The Danish Social Democrats have abstained from voting on the Bontempi report .
The report is a broad survey of the various instruments aimed at ensuring the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice .
The Danish Social Democrats are in favour of ensuring the basic rights for people living in the EU .
However , there are several demands in the report which we oppose .
These include the introduction of a ' Corpus Juris ' , harmonising the basic provisions of procedural law in the Member States and operational powers for Europol .
We have therefore abstained from voting on the report as a whole .
I welcome this report with great satisfaction .
It provides a fair analysis of the action plan of the Council and Commission on implementing an area of freedom , security and justice .
This plan responds to the demand of the Cardiff European Council and is part of a clear and ambitious approach to engage the Union in reforms which will bring it closer to the people of Europe .
An area of this kind clearly can only be constructed gradually .
The Schengen Agreement , the Maastricht Treaty and , of course , the Amsterdam Treaty have been important steps in this construction process .
I am also pleased to see that a new Title headed ' Visas , asylum , immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons ' has been inserted in the Treaty establishing the European Community . This will allow consistency to be increased in the key areas directly affecting the people of Europe .
However , I must indicate my disagreement with the retention of the exemption clause benefiting the United Kingdom , Denmark and Ireland .
Everyone is well aware of the exorbitant cost in terms of consistency of an overly flexible Europe .
The challenges of creating such an area are extremely great .
The rapporteur rightly asserts that this area must be one of the Union 's priorities .
I support this idea because we must meet the expectations of our people who aspire to live securely within the borders of the European Union .
The response to this legitimate demand requires improved border controls and the prevention of crime .
Being secure also implies knowing that you can assert your rights by having recourse to justice .
We all know , myself in particular , that cross-border disputes sometime pose inextricable problems .
We must therefore act to simplify access to the courts and to facilitate cooperation between the judicial authorities of each Member State .
Finally , one of the basic points is to draw up a Charter of fundamental rights .
Such a text will clearly identify the rights which the people may assert within the European Union .
This will ensure that the famous concept of European citizenship , which for many remains an empty shell , will finally take shape .
The level of these rights must be as high as possible .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities must act as guarantor of these rights .
It is absolutely unacceptable that the latter 's jurisdiction is limited on such matters .
I hope that the debate which will take place on this subject in October 1999 in Finland will be productive because there are still gaps despite the positive advances .
The role of the European Parliament must go beyond simple consultation and the unanimity rule must be replaced by the qualified majority rule .
We are voting against Mr Bontempi 's report on the provisions on establishing an area of freedom , security and justice , because we believe the report puts the European federal state at the top of the EU 's list of priorities .
The report emphasises its support for the so-called ' Corpus Juris ' proposal , which is aimed at introducing a European public prosecutor who would be in charge of legal proceedings . At the same time , it stresses that minimum rules should be established for what constitutes a criminal offence and what penalties should be applied .
If these efforts come to fruition , it would mean the establishment not only of a political area but also a judicial area in the EU , where Member States would be obliged to harmonise their different legal traditions and different moral views about what constitutes a criminal offence .
In doing so , we believe that EU cooperation is taking a major step towards the establishment of a federal state .
No one knows what implications the proposals in the report carry with them , but it is clear that the proposed encroachment on national sovereignty is in conflict with the derogations provided for individual Member States with regard to the police and the judiciary , for example .
The EU 's efforts to establish an area of freedom , security and justice are aimed at safeguarding the legal rights of individuals .
We do not believe that legal rights and public confidence in the judicial and political systems will be strengthened by undermining the various judicial cultures of individual Member States and by transferring competence to a system which does not have substantial support among the peoples of the Member States .
The provisions in the field of justice and home affairs should therefore be a matter for national governments .
We think this is an excellent report .
On one point , however , we see things somewhat differently .
We believe that the definition of a child as laid down in the international conventions , namely anyone under the age of 18 , should be adhered to .
The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of a joint action to combat child pornography on the Internet .
The fight against crime on the Internet is transnational by nature , and there is therefore a need for international and European cooperation in this area .
So this joint action , including practical cooperation which also involves Internet service providers , should begin as soon as possible .
However , we do not support the call for harmonisation of the age of consent in the Member States .
Setting the age of consent is the responsibility of the Member States .
No further proof is required of the urgent need to start relentlessly combating the child pornography networks which are invading the Internet .
This is why I support Mr Schmid 's report .
Although Internet users and service providers clearly have a role to play in this fight for human dignity , we cannot rely on them alone .
I therefore believe that certain individual or collective initiatives must be welcomed .
Thanks to this cooperation with the competent authorities , many examples of these abhorrent dealings have been stopped from causing harm .
However , in my opinion it is essential to pool our human and material resources through Europol in order to make the fight against these crimes more effective .
In this respect , I share the rapporteur 's opinion about the description of this child pornography as this is indeed a crime against which the Member States must act accordingly .
However , although the European Union is taking an important step in this fight , it is essential that we establish a strong initiative with regard to third countries so that these networks cannot gain a foothold in any other countries .
Finally , it is imperative to include the site ' hosts ' so that the effect of the actions undertaken in this area can be increased , while ensuring that the main feature of the world wide web , namely freedom , is maintained .
Yet this freedom cannot under any circumstances become synonymous with irresponsibility and anonymity .
I will be supporting this report .
Some argue that the Internet should be completely uncensored .
I disagree .
Although I take a permissive view of what should be allowed , certain images and demands are beyond the pale .
Paedophilia is one limit ; others , for example , are incitement to racial hatred and so-called ' snuff ' movies which show real examples of torture and killing .
It has been argued that control of Internet content is very difficult .
That may be true , but so is preventing murder and we make that illegal .
More recently Parliament 's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment ( STOA ) unit prepared a report on technical aspects of Internet control which revealed that it may be simpler than originally thought .
For example a feature of paedophilia and pornography is large areas of flesh tone .
We may therefore have the means .
All that is lacking may be to find the will .
I will vote for the Schmid report as I believe one of the most disturbing consequences of the development of the Internet is the apparent freedom it gives to distributors of child pornography .
Tackling child pornography requires the cooperation of Internet users who should be encouraged to inform law enforcement authorities if they discover or suspect that an Internet site is being used for the distribution of child pornography .
As the Internet is no respecter of national frontiers cooperation between Member States to tackle this reprehensible practice is vital .
In every Member State the production , processing , supply , distribution and possession of child pornography must be made a criminal offence and Europol should immediately be informed of cases of child pornography .
This is a welcome step in the right direction of improved European cooperation aimed at stamping out this disturbing trade .
Mr President , the CDU and the CSU were obliged to vote against the Reding report , because it was rendered unacceptable by amendments from the left .
We regret that the important issues of asylum seekers and refugees from civil war are linked time and again to various ideological demands : see Amendment No 12 on voting rights and so forth .
This makes it more difficult for us to help in real emergencies .
The hypocrisy of those who vote in favour of amendments of this kind is intolerable , since it is precisely they who are then not prepared in cases such as that of the Kosovo refugees and displaced persons to take in their share of displaced persons .
Take France , for example : Mr Jospin has not taken in anyone from Kosovo .
In Bavaria , we have already created the capacity for 7 000 people .
This is about us providing real and practical help and not continuing to overburden this important subject with our own ideological and unrealistic desires .
If this continues to happen and there is a real emergency , we will remain inflexible , we will not be able to help , and we will provoke unwelcome public opinion .
That is why I call on the left of the House finally to reach a consensus on these issues .
The strategy paper presented by the Austrian Presidency on the European Union 's migration and asylum policy provides a worrying assessment . It states that ' Neither the potential will to emigrate nor actual emigration from the main regions of origin has decreased in the past five years ( rather the opposite ) .
Furthermore , neither the control activities at the external borders of Schengen and the Union nor the Member States ' laws on aliens and asylum stop illegal migration . '
The paper also very rightly notes the changes which have occurred in the types of migratory movement .
In previous decades , these movements largely resulted from the bipolarity between the Western and Communist worlds whereas they are now mainly caused by conflicts between ethnic groups , which are followed by exoduses , or the precarious living conditions in many countries .
As a result , the Council 's strategy paper calls for a review of objectives and the ' Europeanisation ' of instruments .
In particular it makes the following proposals : reduction of migratory pressure at source by intervening in the main countries of origin of immigrants ; reduction of illegal immigration by reinforcing controls and stepping up the fight against illegal immigration networks ; definition of an overall concept of control of legal entry to the Member States , specifically in the country of departure , in the transit states and in the country of final destination , and finally , greater recourse to quantitative control methods ( quotas ) for new immigration , including the reunification of families .
In view of these objectives , we can only be concerned about the proposal for a new refugee protection system which in many cases risks forming an additional magnet .
Unfortunately , in the Reding report the European Parliament has tried to reduce or completely alter the force of these proposals . This clearly demonstrates the problems which we would face if an attempt was made to establish a somewhat restrictive immigration policy in codecision with Parliament .
It is specifically in the second chapter , involving the institutional instruments of the policies to be conducted , that the Austrian Presidency 's document seems most lacking .
It goes without saying that the migration problem is affecting all the European countries and that it would be preferable to define a European response .
However , this response would only make sense if it was more stringent than the current policy .
Specifically , the European institutional system , as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty , with the Commission 's monopoly on initiative and the codecision of the European Parliament , risks producing a laxer response .
We are therefore overwhelmed with contradictions .
In addition , the definition of a European policy should not mean abolishing all national independence in decision-making .
Otherwise , we risk removing responsibility from the Member States and once again achieving a result which is contrary to that intended .
The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations therefore believes that this policy must be maintained in a context where decisions are taken unanimously , with a safeguard clause to be used at the discretion of the Member States thus allowing rapid corrections if necessary .
Mr President , Europe cannot take all the misery of the world on its shoulders .
This is what the former French Prime Minister , Mr Rocard , once said about France .
All the world 's refugees cannot come to Europe .
If they must be accommodated somewhere , they should be placed in countries with which they have the closest ethnic , cultural or religious links .
If the Kosovar Albanians have to be accommodated , they should go to Albania or Turkey . They should not be placed in western Europe whose economic and social advantages attract anyone and everyone , thus leading to migratory influxes which are as harmful to the host country as to the country of origin .
The European nature of the Union must be preserved in terms of its people , its culture and its religion .
To achieve this , we must fix and adhere to an objective of zero immigration .
This debate today is unfortunately very topical .
Even as I am speaking , thousands of Kosovars are being brutally deported from their country , having been hounded from their homes , and are now packed into emergency refugee camps waiting to possibly return to their country .
Some of them , particularly those in Macedonia , are being forced to board planes for unknown destinations .
We , the Member States of the European Union , must welcome these refugees as required . This means that we must allow them every dignity and subsequently do everything in our power to ensure that they can quickly return to their country .
It is in this context that we are discussing the proposed Joint Action today .
I fully support its objectives which are to improve reception conditions for displaced persons and asylum seekers and to facilitate the voluntary return of refugees .
We must improve the reception conditions in material terms but also in human terms because these people are more often than not in a state of utter psychological turmoil .
I do not need to say any more for you have all seen the terrible pictures broadcast constantly on television screens around the world , except on Serbian television of course !
Reception is only the first stage .
We must also facilitate the return of these people to their country and ensure their reintegration .
However , I must point out a shortcoming , the gravity of which is underlined by the events in the Balkans .
The Commission has omitted to include an essential aspect which the European Parliament put forward , namely emergency aid in cases of sudden influxes of refugees from a region affected by a severe crisis .
Finally , I must highlight Parliament 's commitment to refugees and its ability to anticipate events .
For the 1999 financial year , this House proposed creating a European Refugee Fund .
From the year 2000 this Fund should finance the whole refugee policy .
And also from this date these matters will come under the competence of the Community , which can only be welcomed .
With the Kosovo crisis raging a new urgency is given to the two Council proposals to deal with the situation of refugees .
These two proposals are being made under the ' third pillar ' and will need to be revisited when the Treaty of Amsterdam is in force .
The first measure is intended to support and develop existing measures at local , regional , national and EU levels to make refugees independent and prevent them from becoming socially marginalised .
The second measure is a proposal for joint action supporting the reception and voluntary repatriation of refugees , displaced persons and asylum applicants .
The action aims to improve reception conditions for asylum seekers and displaced persons and to facilitate their voluntary return and reintegration in their countries of origin .
The amendments suggested by Mrs Zimmerman are welcome and on the whole strengthen the proposals .
In particular , the establishment of a European Refugee Fund and support for reception centres in Member States are important initiatives .
In general , we support the use of environmental taxes as a means of bringing about improvements in the environment .
However , we only support a common EU environmental tax as long as it focuses on the environment and as long as the proceeds are returned to the Member States .
We cannot support the EU regulating these national economic instruments solely in order to promote trade and the internal market .
We have therefore voted for individual parts of the report , but have abstained from voting on the report as a whole .
We voted against the report in the final vote for the following reasons .
The report contains a number of environmentally friendly proposals to which we have already given our support .
However , the report is based on a system of so-called tax trade-offs that are designed to reduce countries ' tax bases , drain national insurance systems and make social redistribution harder .
On the whole the report is - and here we quote the Environment Committee - more ' brown than green ' .
There is no reference in the report to nuclear power and its problems .
The implication of the report is that there would be interference in tax policy , which would impinge on the role of national parliaments to represent the people 's right to decide on their own taxes .
It goes far beyond the strict principle of minimum rates of taxation .
It would give the power of taxation to institutions which lack democratic legitimacy and over whose policies the people have no control .
We are voting in favour of the Cox report because these ecotaxes are a logical political measure which make sense under certain conditions .
However , some important steps first need to be taken :
a fundamental tax reform with a general reduction in overall tax revenue ; - targeted measures ; - a clear promotion of renewable sources of energy.The ecotaxes , conceived as a policy instrument , should under no circumstances degenerate into a means of tapping new sources of revenue .
That is also why we reject Amendment No 6 .
The proposal for a Directive on the taxation of energy products has returned before this House and I must again congratulate Mr Cox on the further simplification and rationalisation which he has tried to achieve .
However , I must reiterate the concerns expressed previously and incorporated into the amendments for which I was jointly responsible . The rejection of these amendments is the reason why I and my group voted against this report .
Regardless of the fact that a tax which alters the production functions cannot be regarded as neutral , it is important in terms of this neutrality to ask whether this is just one attainable objective or the ultimate objective to be attained .
It is actually more important to achieve a more prosperous economy offering employment opportunities . This is a priority objective and we must determine whether this will be damaged by excessive taxation of energy .
In any case , as one of the primary concerns must be not to distort competition between production sectors and means of transport , we must avoid unjustifiably penalising some and not others .
The labour costs of each one must of course be taken into account but this cannot be the only circumstance considered , in case we unfairly let off other sectors and methods of transport which are equally noisy and polluting .
Finally , you will understand if I again express unanswered concerns about social justice and economic cohesion .
It is not acceptable to aggravate the situations of families with more modest resources who must spend higher percentages of their incomes on energy . Also , the situation of peripheral countries must not be worsened by forcing these to incur higher transport costs , particularly where this involves means of transport which are necessarily large energy consumers - as in the case of road transport - for which realistic alternatives cannot immediately be found .
The proposals before us are partly a response to the requirement to review the minimum rates of excise duty on hydrocarbons laid down in Article 10 of Directive 92 / 82 / EEC . They are also a result of the Council 's request , following the deadlock in negotiations on the CO2 / energy tax , to put forward new proposals in the field of taxation of energy products .
The aim of any tax should be that it is simple to understand , easy to collect , predictable and difficult to evade .
This is why we are in favour of the polluter pays principle .
However , the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations shares with all sectors of economic activity a deep concern at the introduction of new taxes on energy products or the increase of the present taxes .
We consider that the establishment of a Community framework for the taxation of energy products , with the Member States having the opportunity to act in a flexible manner in their application of indirect taxes , may provide an appropriate escape route from the dilemma into which the failure of the CO2 / energy tax has led the Union .
This may also be a way of achieving the internal energy market and may provide a necessary response to the undertakings given in Kyoto .
Taxation actually partly determines the price of energy products . It may therefore act as an incentive to optimise energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency and by reducing the emission of pollutants into the air and the overall generation of waste .
We consider that a comprehensive ecologically-based tax reform may provide a real weapon for combating unemployment in the Member States , provided that an environmental clause is introduced into the WTO rules as we expressly requested during the last GATT negotiations .
Otherwise , we will end up creating discriminatory measures which penalise our own companies .
The increase in tax yield from energy consumption , if correctly compensated for by a reduction in labour costs on companies , may have a positive effect on employment . This of course depends on production tools in the industrial energy-consuming sectors not being relocated , as was seen for example in France during the 1970s in the horticulture sector .
This is why our group voted in favour of the amendments promoting simple taxation , including the various dispensation principles , but rejected all the amendments which would systematically increase the taxation of energy products .
Some amendments actually envisaged introducing a systematic coefficient of increase for all energy products , without taking into account the international constraints applicable within the WTO .
Mr President , the European Police Office or Europol was set up with a purely intergovernmental status and under the control of the national parliaments . Its purpose is to gather information on international crime and exchange this between the Member States of the European Union .
This is an extremely important task which deserves to be pursued very energetically , with the sole concern being its effectiveness in practice .
However , the European Parliament is clearly not satisfied with this .
As is apparent from the Nassauer report which we have just discussed , this House wants to take Europol and make it into an example of a supranational administration .
This House is essentially asking for Europol to be converted into a European police unit with operational powers in the Member States and powers of command over the national police forces .
Would this federal super-police force actually contribute anything more to the fight against crime ?
The Nassauer report does not demonstrate this and indeed does not even consider this question .
You would almost think that this was of no importance .
The report 's main objective is instead to advance the federalist cause .
We therefore gradually learn that the supranational Europol should take orders from a European public prosecutor 's office , itself under the responsibility of the European Commission , which would be accountable in this respect only to the European Parliament .
This is all very well in theory .
However , in practice it is clear that once again serious work and the progress which really could be achieved will be sacrificed to totally futile ideological quarrels . These will end up blocking all progress as the countries and parties square up to each other .
We witnessed this during the many years of preparation of the Europol Convention .
The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations prefers serious work .
We want Europol to develop within the intergovernmental framework because it will be more effective to rely on the national authorities to improve the exchange of information .
We also want to really make the system democratic by placing it under the control of an interparliamentary monitoring committee . This would consist of representatives from the national parliaments who would be responsible for reporting to their respective houses .
The development of the EU into an area of freedom , security and justice is extremely important for the people of Europe , and we therefore welcome the Nassauer report .
However , we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area .
Europol should merely complement and assist national police forces and not be able to take direct action against our citizens .
As regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor , we are opposed to such a move because there is no supranational cooperation on matters of criminal law .
Cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental .
The Danish Social Democrats have voted against an extension of Europol 's powers .
We do not support turning Europol into a supranational institution .
We are not in favour of developing Europol in the direction of a European police force with operational powers . Nor are we in favour of setting up a European judicial authority to direct Europol .
Europol should not develop into a European police authority , but should continue to be a form of intergovernmental cooperation .
The report by our colleague follows on logically from our work on the fight against crime .
As an elected representative of a cross-border region , I read Mr Nassauer 's report with great interest .
In view of the development of criminal networks , we must rapidly adapt our weapons against these . This is why Europol must be able to adapt accordingly .
However , it has a credibility problem with the people .
Like the rapporteur , I hope that Europol can become a genuine police force with cross-border operational powers .
There are many cases which should prompt us to consider and accelerate this development in order to establish a unit which is capable of actively combating this scourge .
In this respect , the European Union must have jurisdiction in order to conduct the investigations needed to combat crime .
This House has already given its opinion on these matters on many occasions .
It is now up to the Commission and our governments to take steps to ensure that crime is fought effectively .
We have no time to lose on this .
As the aim of bringing Europe closer to the people seems to be the stated desire of an increasing number of politicians , this must now be put into practice .
By this means , I wished to emphasise once again that I clearly see that the lack of parliamentary supervision of Europol is a problem , and that any steps to resolve this have my full support .
I have of course also voted in favour of these points .
However , I think that the approach adopted in the report , of putting Europol under the supervision of a Commissioner and thus under the supervision of the European Parliament , is the wrong one .
I certainly cannot agree to Europol having higher status than national officers either : this is unacceptable .
For these reasons , I voted against the report in the final vote .
Mr President , the whole idea of corpus juris is something that has not been discussed in public .
There have been no public discussions on it ; there have been no discussions in national parliaments .
This has all taken place in secret , behind closed doors .
What is most amazing is the silence of the British Members of this House .
For Britain and Ireland the whole legal system is under serious threat .
The proposal is to harmonise the EU criminal legal system on the continental inquisitorial model .
The British and Irish systems are very different .
I cannot understand why no British Member in this House has raised the question of what is going on here .
The British and Irish systems are very much based on the presumption of innocence , trial by one 's peers , as in the Magna Carta .
The issue of habeas corpus is also in danger here - the guarantee of safety while somebody is in custody .
My main point is the whole lack of debate on this issue , the fact that all this is taking place in secret .
It has been pushed through behind closed doors so that Members of this Parliament are not even aware of what are the real consequences of corpus juris .
They should look at what is going on .
The British Members should look at whether they want to get rid of their own system and bring in this EU criminal legal system which will be based on the continental inquisitorial model .
I do not think the British or Irish public want this kind of system .
If they do , at the very least people should have the right to discuss what kind of system is being brought in .
Going back to what the last speaker said , there is a major rush on here to harmonise everything within Europe , to actually set up a European police force .
The next thing will be a European army .
We are harmonising the legal systems , whether for better or worse , without proper public debate , without public accountability .
This whole institution lacks any kind of democratic control or democratic accountability .
The people of Europe have had no say whatsoever in the direction Europe is taking .
Something has to be done about it .
People in the Member States have to know the decisions that have been taken on their behalf which may not , in the long-term , be in their interests .
The development of the EU into an area of freedom , security and justice is extremely important for the people of Europe , and we therefore welcome the Wiebenga report .
However , we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area .
Europol should merely complement and assist national police forces and not be able to take direct action against our citizens .
As regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor , we are opposed to such a move because there is no supranational cooperation on matters of criminal law .
Cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental .
The Danish Social Democrats have voted against the introduction of a common European public prosecutor .
We should not have a common European criminal law or public prosecutor .
We can fight crime just as effectively with the existing instruments , including Europol and the conventions on extradition and mutual judicial assistance .
We should not harmonise for the sake of harmonising .
And in fact the differences between the criminal laws of the Member States are not so great that they cannot be overcome by using existing intergovernmental instruments .
Efforts to successfully combat international crime are right and proper .
Any obstruction of effective prosecution by an individual Member State must be prevented , so that public safety can be guaranteed .
However , this does not justify the creation of a supranational authority which would intrude heavily on the authority of the individual Member States and thus flagrantly impair their sovereignty .
Effective prosecution can only be guaranteed by the authorities on the spot .
For these reasons , although I voted in favour of the report , I voted against the proposed appointment of a European public prosecutor in the final vote .
The report from the Council to the European Council on activities on drugs and drugs-related issues under the UK Presidency is , generally speaking , a constructive one .
The contents of the report reveal that the proponents of decriminalisation are now on the defensive .
The drugs debate is now being conducted in an objective way here in Parliament , in spite of the differences that exist between the approaches taken by Members from countries which have different drugs policies . We think we have contributed towards achieving this progress .
It means that in future the EU will be able to work in a more constructive manner .
This is a vital achievement , since the problems posed by drugs are still enormous both in Europe and the world in general .
I can certainly endorse some of Mrs d 'Ancona 's criticisms of the Council document on the post-1999 EU drugs strategy .
I definitely share the rapporteur 's demand that Commission and Council forces should be joined in a single document so that there is greater clarity and , above all , better coordination leading to more effective and rational action on drugs .
I also endorse her criticism of the Council 's attitude to Parliament : consultation did indeed take place at a very late stage .
Finally , I can also go along with her comments concerning the need to promote prevention and information activities , to contribute to crop substitution and to ensure more effective coordination between the police and customs to combat drug trafficking .
However , I certainly cannot endorse Mrs d 'Ancona 's habitual pragmatic approach to the problem of drugs .
This pragmatic approach consists of resigning oneself to the fact that drug abuse is a social phenomenon which is virtually impossible to eradicate : according to the rapporteur , it can be contained and fought only by means of a damage-limitation exercise ; in plain language , through the legalisation of soft drugs and the controlled administration of hard drugs .
To the rapporteur , this is the only way of de-ideologising the drugs debate .

I cannot share her reasoning : ideology and politics have nothing to do with a drugs strategy ; all that really does count is the value of and respect for life .
For these reasons , since I am convinced that a drugs strategy cannot ultimately be based on the approach set out by Mrs d 'Ancona , I am voting against the motion .
Voting on a report by Mrs d 'Ancona on drugs and drug addiction has become something of an institution in this House .
However , all the texts which she has presented through a unanimous Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs have had an inexorable tendency to be devoid of any proposals . They are simply mediums for general requests .
However , by their very existence and the enterprise of those supporting them , these reports are still a constant means of pressure in favour of more libertarian measures .
Mrs d 'Ancona would like to ensure ' a de-ideologising of the drugs debate in Europe ' .
But what is the ideology of those who maintain that respect for human dignity requires us to ban anything which may harm us or of those who believe it is enough to control the use of drugs to limit their potential risks to health ?
It is certainly essential to allow and develop cooperation between all those who , in one way or another , through either prevention or repression , are involved in the fight against this scourge of our societies . However , cooperation must also especially be encouraged with those who are victims of drugs and with their families .
In this general context , it is not right to trivialise drug addiction as an insignificant activity of no consequence .
At a time when restrictions on smoking are rightly increasing and when authorised alcohol levels for driving are being reduced , is it appropriate to provide a contrary example of irresponsible liberalisation , particularly when drug addiction causes greater harm to people ?
We voted against this report and not just because , in the words of the supporters of decriminalisation , it contains nothing of interest . We feel it constitutes another step in this policy of gradual rather than rapid progress which has been rejected by a glimmer of common sense among a majority in this House .
That concludes Voting Time .
The sitting was suspended at 1.42 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.

Agriculture ( continuation )
The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on agriculture .
Mr JovÃ© Peres has the floor .
Mr President , I will try to be very brief and will confine myself to the oral question to the Commission on imports of garlic .
The Commission 's response on imports of garlic is quite a surprise , ladies and gentlemen .
The problem does not lie in differences of analysis .
For once , everyone seems to be in agreement .
The problem is one of pace .
The problem itself was identified as far back as 1993 , but the solution was inadequate .
Clearly , when the safeguard clause was applied to garlic from China , it was already possible to predict that a number of traders would set up triangular arrangements , nationalising the Chinese garlic in Thailand , Taiwan , Vietnam , Iran , Malaysia , Jordan , India , or any other country .
Such a system is easy to conceive and is also viable , given how slack certain Member States usually are when it comes to carrying out customs checks .
Triangular trade has therefore continued to expand , and garlic production in the Community is moving ever closer to extinction .
In Spain alone , 15 000 farms and more than three and a half million direct jobs are at risk .
Furthermore , production is highly concentrated in certain geographical areas .
The social and economic consequences of the present situation will therefore be very serious .
Can this state of affairs really be due to administrative slowness ?
Can rural development measures really compensate for such shortcomings ?
It is therefore surprising that the Commission has stated that there is no time to implement an effective system this season because the procedure to establish a global quota and change tariffs in the World Trade Organisation has not been initiated .
There has , in fact , been ample time to initiate it and if it has not yet been set up then emergency action must be taken until it is . Such action must involve applying retaliatory measures to countries taking part in the triangular trade and compensating Community producers for loss of income .
Mr President , I shall confine myself to the Fantuzzi report .
The promotion fund for agricultural products is seen by many as a substitute for export refunds .
Now these refunds have been cut , we have to look to promotional activities , so the reasoning goes .
This reasoning conceals a major risk , because it seems the Union is going to conduct its export policy along the same lines .
This was an export policy which was certainly advantageous to Europe 's farmers , but which had numerous disadvantages as well .
It was a policy whereby the European Union dumped its internal market surpluses on the world market at the expense of the developing countries .
We must abandon this export policy driven by quantity .
There must be information campaigns to promote a clear emphasis on quality .
Only products which pay proper attention to food safety , animal welfare and the environment should be considered for subsidy .
Developing countries must be given the chance to develop their own agricultural potential .
Subsidising the export of European products to these countries would seriously hamper that process , and I am against it .
Nor must we equate promotional activities with export subsidies in terms of financing .
The aim of export subsidies is to keep agricultural prices high throughout the Union .
That works to the advantage of all Europe 's farmers .
So it is obvious that Europe should finance that .
The same logic does not apply to sales promotion .
Advertising is only effective if it goes together with a speciality or trademark .
If the products concerned are made principally responsible for financing , that creates a new link between costs and benefits .
European subsidies should at most play a supplementary role .
Mr President , I should like to make a few brief , general points on the debate which began this morning and is continuing this afternoon , and which will perhaps be - if not the last - then one of the last on general agricultural matters to be held in the Commissioner 's presence .
The policy on prices has become well established over recent years .
Let us hope that future crises and our commitments to the CEECs will not oblige us to downsize even further , and that other events do not compound two negative trends which have been noticeable in the past few years : not only the falling incomes of European farmers , but above all the drop in their numbers .
Thirty years ago , farmers represented some 25 % of the workforce in Europe ; now they have shrunk to around 5 % .
What particularly concerns us , moreover , is that full-time farmers are steadily being replaced by part-timers , who cannot guarantee proper levels of professionalism .
I am referring here to Mr Fantuzzi 's report on quality : clearly , non-professional farmers cannot guarantee top quality , and this will have an effect on product promotion strategies both within the Union and in third countries .
I agree with the offensive strategy proposed by the rapporteur .
We should not wait for a disaster like BSE before promoting the consumption of European beef - safe beef , naturally - just as we should not have waited for globalisation , and hence the influx onto the EU market of wines from around the world , before deciding to promote European wine and explain to everyone that it is not harmful , especially as long as one does not over-indulge .
What is more , as with all of life 's pleasures - ' wine , tobacco and women are a man 's downfall ' , as the Italian proverb goes - everything should be done in moderation .
And so it is a matter of educating consumers : moderation , quality and teaching people how to drink - and , above all , how much to drink .
Finally , I agree that the funding is excessively limited , ludicrously so , for a promotion campaign such as this , given the present cost of advertising .
Mr President , I certainly hope that it will not be the last time that I am speaking here on agriculture to Mr Fischler as a member of the Commission , because over the years he has done an extremely good job .
I very much agree with the price package that has come out of the Commission - it is very similar to a lot of the proposals I put forward two years ago when I was the rapporteur on that particular price package .
I am concerned that we are making a singular mistake today if we think that the price package and the Berlin Summit are not intertwined .
Agriculture is not about a short-term gain and short-term positions : it means planning for five or ten years .
I work on a ten-year rotation ; plans have to be made far further ahead than for any short-term positions .
I totally disagree with Mr Rehder when he said that the Berlin Summit had been a great success .
It has been a total disaster for agriculture !
It was a total misconception , it was done in a hurry , without thinking about the future of agriculture .
That is why it is very important that we keep the discussions flowing and work for the benefit of agriculture .
I wish to come back to a point the Commissioner made in his speech .
He said very poignantly that we were not going to allow the Americans to dominate European agriculture .
I was delighted to hear it .
However , we are signatories to the WTO .
Are we going to accept WTO regulations , even though it may mean somewhat expensive payments or having to take imports which we do not want ?
Perhaps the Commissioner could clarify that .
Finally , Mr Funk mentioned co-financing .
I hope that co-financing is forgotten about forever .
Mr President , Commissioner , given the time , I should like to confine my comments to the Peres report .
Amending and correcting the regulation on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is extremely important .
In my view , serious questions need to be asked about the waiver from the obligation to supply producer organisations for products which are marketed directly by the producer .
This method of selling by means of direct marketing has traditionally had a very special status in Germany , which I myself have strongly supported for many years .
You said this morning , Commissioner , that this is the second marketing year that the new regime for fruit and vegetables has been in force .
Unfortunately , however , I have discovered that the Commission only takes the waiver in the market organisation to mean sales on the producer 's holding .
What is the position for sales in the field , at the roadside or at the weekly market ?
This extremely restrictive interpretation is the result of a letter from Mr Legrand of the Commission .
You are nodding ; it seems then that there have been more recent developments .
That would certainly be welcome .
The proportion of goods permitted to be marketed directly is supposed to remain unchanged at 20 % of the produce of each Member State .
In this context , one of the issues we discussed in the Agriculture Committee was how it is proposed to check up on this .
Is it not the case that implementing this system in agricultural holdings will actually be extremely difficult ?
If you consider agricultural practice , for example at asparagus or strawberry time , you might be forgiven for thinking that a certain amount of idealism is at work here .
I do not believe that the rule of the game should be direct sales when demand is high and the producer organisation when demand is slack .
But the monitoring of the whole scheme seems to me to have been too theoretically conceived .
Mr President , Commissioner , I will confine my comments to the Fantuzzi report . We should not forget that it was under the Luxembourg Presidency in December 1997 that the Council acknowledged the need to continue developing the current model of European agriculture while strengthening its competitiveness , particularly on the markets of third countries .
The proposal now before us is a result of that desire and also of the wishes of the Agriculture Ministers .
This proposal is laudable and should therefore be approved . However , it is unfortunately too timid and too paltry , if I may say so , in terms of the financial resources of EUR 15 million .
Moreover , the promotional instrument proposed should be simplified and rationalised . This instrument really must take advantage of the experience and know-how of the existing professional structures in order to encourage and implement promotional and publicity measures on agricultural products and processed products which can be exported or sold through new outlets in third countries .
With regard to the financing , I agree with our rapporteur who has rightly pointed out that the United States annually devotes nearly ten times more than the modest appropriations indicated by the Commission for promotion on the markets of third countries .
The Community should also be able to fully finance measures such as participation at events , fairs , exhibitions and so on .
The financial participation of the Commission should also be rather more substantial , as we have proposed .
In view of the problems which may arise when , on the basis of an open or restricted invitation to tender , the Commission chooses the body responsible for implementing the promotional measures , it would be safer and more transparent for the organisation proposing the programmes and measures to be responsible for implementing these and for choosing the necessary service providers .
I proposed amendments to this end which were approved by the Agriculture Committee and which I hope the Commission will accept .
Finally , I must insist on the strengthening of the consultation procedures of the Management Committees and the Standing Group on the Promotion of Agricultural Products .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you are all aware , garlic production in the European Union is concentrated in specific regions where this crop has great social and economic importance . It involves more than 15 000 farms and some three and a half million direct jobs .
Garlic is being imported on a massive scale from Asian and Middle Eastern countries , some of which do not even produce it .
The amounts involved exceed the maximum overall quota of 33 600 tonnes . Moreover , imported garlic appears in European Union markets after crossing borders at which officials are not always conscientious as regards properly enforcing the correct procedures relating to quotas and quality .
This amounts to a clear departure from the arrangements for commercial traffic envisaged in Article 115 of the Treaty .
We therefore call on the Member States to provide the customs entry points with the human and material resources needed to undertake correct tariff classification , carry out phytosanitary inspections and check the origin of products . Further , we urge the Commission to demand that Member States be conscientious over border formalities .
We also call on the European Commission to broaden the scope of Regulation No 544 / 97 introducing certificates of origin for garlic imported from certain third countries , and to apply retaliatory trade measures to those countries involved in fraudulent deals . According to Article 115 of the Treaty , such measures aim to prevent distortion in the movement of goods under the framework of the common commercial policy .
In addition , a dissuasive customs tariff for imports over and above the set limit should be put in place . Measures to compensate garlic producers for loss of income should also be considered in order to tide them over until the other measures previously requested come into effect .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have already had the opportunity today to explain the Commission 's position in some detail .
There is therefore no need for me to repeat myself now .
I should simply like to thank very much all those who spoke in the debate for their constructive contributions and to respond briefly to three specific questions which have been asked in the meantime .
Firstly , as far as garlic is concerned , I said that we want to work on two fronts here .
We want to make use of the existing safeguard clause again , and to activate this for a further period .
In this respect , I was asked how this will be monitored .
It is quite clear that the task of monitoring falls on the Member States .
We have already alerted the Member States several times to the fact that their customs authorities , in particular , must make it known that there is a risk of garlic being imported illegally from certain countries .
The countries are also sufficiently well known .
In addition , we have introduced our own certificates to make monitoring easier .
We are aware , however , that these measures - at least in the way they have been implemented so far - are not sufficient to achieve satisfactory results .
That is precisely why we are also prepared to go a step further .
We will be tabling a proposal for a negotiating mandate so that we can negotiate a suitable mechanism for fixing quotas in the WTO .
On the second question - raised by Mr Sturdy - about the WTO , Europe 's position and how it proposes to act , all I can say to you today is the following : although this Commission is only an acting Commission at the present time , I believe that it is necessary and important - and I have therefore issued instructions to this effect to the services responsible - for us to develop a negotiating strategy based on the agreements reached as part of Agenda 2000 as soon as possible , so that we will then be in a position in the second half of the year to liaise with other countries about this forthcoming WTO round .
You can safely assume that part of our strategy will be to take measures to strengthen Europe 's position .
I can reassure Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert : the object of our proposal for an amendment is precisely no longer to include only sales on the producer 's holding - when they take place on the holding - but to treat sales at weekly markets and all the other direct sales measures you mentioned in just the same way as direct sales on the producer 's holding , that is to say as an exception and thus as part of the 25 % rule .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I have received three motions for resolutions to wind up the debate , tabled pursuant to Rule 40 ( 5 ) .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Informing and consulting employees
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the information , consultation and participation of workers has been a key subject of debate in Europe ever since the first social action programme was adopted by the Council in 1974 .
Since then the Commission has launched several initiatives , but these have often met with resistance .
In a context of continuous change , the adaptability of employees is of crucial importance and forms an integral part of the employment strategy adopted by the Luxembourg European Council .
Almost all the EU Member States have a legal framework - be it statutory or contractual - to ensure that employees are informed and consulted .
It has to be said , however , that the current state of affairs - with its limitations and flaws - has proved not to give workers sufficient information and opportunities to be consulted on issues that really matter for the decisions of the undertaking .
Consequently , the purpose of this initiative is to complete the existing national and Community framework , thereby helping - by improving the legislation - to prepare for change , ensure that restructuring takes place under reasonable circumstances and give employment the priority it now deserves .
The proposed framework is therefore aimed at remedying the gaps and countering the shortcomings of the existing national and Community legislation currently in force .
The objectives are : to ensure the existence of the right to regular information and consultation of employees on economic and strategic developments in the undertaking and on the decisions which affect them ; to consolidate the social dialogue and relations of trust within the undertaking in order to assist risk anticipation , develop the flexibility of work organisation within a framework of security , enhance employees ' awareness of the need to adapt and encourage them to participate in measures and operations designed to boost their employability ; to include the situation and anticipated development of employment within the undertaking among the subjects of information and consultation ; to ensure that workers are informed and consulted prior to decisions which are likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations ; and to ensure the effectiveness of these procedures by introducing specific penalties for those who seriously violate their obligations in this field .
I should like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative .
There is no doubt that , with a single currency and a large single market , with increasingly interdependent economies and fiscal policies which , albeit belatedly , are starting to be coordinated , social policies are bound to become increasingly supranational in scale , so as to preserve and further promote our social model , which is recognised by a large number of authoritative sources as one of the decisive factors in our competitiveness .
In particular , this proposal will ensure minimum standards for information and consultation to be applied throughout the Community , by harmonising the fundamental rights of employees and helping to strengthen the European social dimension .
It is therefore deplorable that the negotiations between the social partners at European level for an agreement in accordance with Article 4 ( 2 ) of the Social Protocol have failed , in particular because of one side 's total unwillingness to negotiate .
The Commission was quite right to fully exercise its right of initiative as sanctioned by the Treaty .
The European Parliament , through my report , is proposing certain amendments .
Here I wish to thank all those colleagues who have tabled amendments , thereby contributing significantly to the committee 's work .
Our amendments - on which we must hear the views of the Commission and which I hope the Council , in adopting its position , will regard as the European Parliament 's firm wishes - are designed in particular to specify the means of implementing and defining information and consultation , especially as regards the point in time when information must be communicated , in other words planning , so as to enable employees to anticipate change , extending the content of information and consultation to other subjects which directly involve the rights of employees and their future ; to extend the scope of this directive , proposing that it should include the public sector , and that the Member States should consider the possibility of including SMEs ; and to ensure that minimum requirements are laid down at Community level from which it is not possible to derogate except to the benefit of employees .
In conclusion , I am absolutely convinced that if the period of profound change which we are currently experiencing is to have a positive outcome , both in terms of increased competitiveness on the part of undertakings and of greater civil and social harmony , a major readiness for dialogue is required .
This proposal , improved and strengthened by the report now under discussion , is an innovative means of promoting social dialogue , by informing and consulting employees , so as to guarantee stability and respect for the laws of the Europe we are striving to build .
Mr President , Mrs Ghilardotti has done some excellent work on an important subject .
This is a plank in the Commission 's overall plan , to have information and consultation of workers and should be considered along with the directives on consultation in collective redundancies , consultation in transfer of undertakings , the European Company Statute and the European Works Council directives .
The Committee on Legal Affairs has supported me and we have put forward a number of amendments .
There are concerns in some quarters that there is a problem with subsidiarity in this draft proposal but I believe that the reports I have already mentioned show that it is entirely appropriate for the Commission to act in this area .
More particularly it fills a gap in employment legislation which was vividly exposed by the closure of the Renault plant at Vilvoorde and I congratulate the Commission - I should say acting Commission - for plugging this serious gap .
My own country has some misgivings about the need for this legislation , but I would suggest that Her Majesty 's Government visit some of the factories in my own constituency .
All the factories that I have visited in the last few years in the West Midlands have information boards where they show productivity levels , productivity targets , health and safety information , etc .
All sensible employers I know see informing and consulting workers as a top priority for increasing productivity .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I should first like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for her report , which we support in every respect .
I should , however , also like to thank the Commission for presenting a report here which has made it very easy for us to endorse its conclusions on this issue .
This directive constitutes a further building block in a social Europe , coming after our adoption of the European works councils and - I hope - shortly before the European Company and worker participation legislation is adopted .
However , it also constitutes a counterweight to capital in Europe .
I believe that this is very important and sensible , particularly at the present time , so that the public realise that Europe does not adopt laws in a vacuum .
I agree with Ms Oddy 's assertion that of course this will not lead to national rules being abandoned .
Those Member States which believe that employee involvement gives them increased and more extensive consultation rights will obviously keep their own rules .
If you take a closer look , however , you will see that in many countries - including Germany - there are sectors in which employees are still unable to participate in decision making .
The specific issue which I should like to address here is the size of the company .
There is inadequate provision for small and medium-sized enterprises , including in Germany .
That is why we would have preferred the company size threshold to have been set at 20 employees .
I am mentioning this here quite specifically and hope that the PPE Group can , after all , decide to go along with our proposals .
Similarly , I also hope that you , Mr Menrad , and the other members of the PPE Group will vote against excluding certain media companies and charitable organisations from the information and consultation obligations in connection with the provision on the protection of certain interests , and will endorse our proposal .
The view expressed by one media company in a letter to us - that the human rights and fundamental rights associated with the freedom of the press will be violated if we do not vote for it - is one which I find absolutely absurd .
In my opinion , there is a pressing need for there also to be worker involvement in media companies .
I do not share Mrs Ghilardotti 's misgivings about UNICE .
I think that perhaps it is even a good thing that UNICE declined to negotiate .
As a result , we have a reasonable proposal from the Commission which , particularly in terms of sanctions , contains much more far-reaching measures which we all support and which would certainly not have emerged from a social dialogue .
Finally , I should like to express my hope and voice my request that the German Presidency and the Council as a whole should support this important building block in a social Europe as soon as possible .
Commissioner , a central tenet of Christian social doctrine and of the PPE Group 's statement of principles is partnership ; that includes participation and joint decision making , as well as informing and consulting employees .
It was on this basis that our group made an important contribution here in Parliament in 1994 to the directive on European works councils , which was adopted almost unanimously .
Since then , it is true to say that European works councils have been a real success story and that with the agreement of employers , employees and unions they are increasingly widespread .
One of the aims of the EWC is to pass on information received from central management to the local employees ' representatives in good time - across borders - so that they can do their job .
The system only works if national laws give the local employees ' representatives adequate rights .
Amongst other things , this directive seeks to ensure that this is the case by setting minimum standards - minimum standards for information and consultation , not for participation in decision making .
Mrs Ghilardotti has produced a good and very thorough report , on which I would congratulate her .
In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , she accepted a compromise solution on thresholds of 50 employees . That is acceptable , Mrs Weiler , and it is what the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee had in mind .
We are against total deletion of the provision on the protection of certain interest groups , as the report demands .
However , in our amendments we propose a solution along the same lines as the works councils directive , which provides for this protection but severely restricts it .
Quite simply , this is also about gaining broader support .
It is particularly important - especially for small and medium-sized companies - for the Member States to provide for waivers if passing on information does considerable damage to the company .
A release from these responsibilities must not be arbitrary , however , and that is why objective criteria need to be laid down and provision made if necessary for the granting of official or judicial authorisation .
A framework for national rules on information and consultation which is structured in this way and which respects subsidiarity , Mrs Ghilardotti , is something we want to vote for .
It is an important step towards building the social dimension and towards creating a proper partnership in the European Union and - you are right - it also has economic advantages .
It is precisely at a time of rapid change and in a global economy that a lack of information engenders mistrust and ultimately fear , leading to a breakdown in relations .
Information means transparency , which creates trust and avoids losses in European companies due to friction .
Employers and employees are equal winners here .
Mr President , on behalf of a considerable majority of my group , I welcome the Commission 's proposals .
I would remind you of the debates we had here on Vilvoorde and the Renault affair , for example , when we found that our rules on information and codetermination were not strong enough , and certainly not as far as penalties were concerned .
This proposal is a major step forward in terms of informing and consulting employees at European level .
The majority of my group will be voting for the compromise reached , namely that the legislation should apply to firms employing more than 50 people .
I must reiterate how important it is to have information and consultation .
Many firms which do this well take great care over how they treat their workers .
And it makes for a level playing field that consultation and codetermination requirements of this kind should apply Europe-wide .
It is , furthermore , a sign of the times .
The rapporteur speaks tellingly in her report of the need to strengthen the social dialogue and promote mutual trust . And I think it can be seen as an example to the rest of the world , because we know that Japan and the USA lag behind us on this .
From my own experience in the Netherlands , I know that works councils have often acquitted themselves better , when firms close down , than the management which was accountable to investors .
I think we need to realise - certainly those who are still reluctant , and I am looking at my colleagues in my own group here - that this is an area which offers great opportunities for modern-day entrepreneurship .
So I think we should wholeheartedly endorse this proposal , together with some of the amendments .
Mr President , this issue of the framework for informing and consulting employees is controversial .
It would be even more controversial if participation in the decision-making process , which this House has already asserted in various resolutions as being the right of employees , were added to information and consultation .
In accordance with its well-established practice , the Commission was in favour of the social partners establishing these rules themselves .
However , UNICE , the employers ' organisation at Community level , believes this issue falls within the principle of subsidiarity .
There were therefore no negotiations because the Commission was forced to present its proposal for a directive outside the social dialogue .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was charged with drawing up an opinion on this report .
This task fell to me and my intention was to help make real progress in the direction previously taken by the European Parliament .
Most members of this committee did not believe this to be the way forward and actually adopted UNICE 's position .
No opinion was approved and the procedural page of the report states that the committee ' decided not to deliver an opinion ' .
This is to be regretted because this opinion would have contributed to the resolution which Parliament is going to adopt , whether my formulation was used or another one subject to more general agreement .
This is why I congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti on her work and her report .
If you will allow me , Mr President , I must say something briefly on another report on this area which came before this House today and which , due to Rule 52 , was not debated or voted on .
I am referring to the report on the organisation of work which must be regarded as a minor issue as it was rushed through Parliament .
How our priorities are distorted !
We voted on the monitoring of marine biotoxins and roll-over stability , which are technical reports whose importance I do not deny , but we passed over the report on ' modernising the organisation of work - a positive approach to change ' . Yet there are those who want the information , consultation and participation of employees to come under the principle of subsidiarity .
And then we complain about the public 's lack of interest in the European Parliament !
Mr President , there is a gap in the EWC directive ; that became only too clear during the strike at Vilvoorde , as previous speakers have already pointed out .
Clarification is needed on what information requirements actually exist .
This is provided in the important and very fine piece of work produced by Mrs Ghilardotti .
Of course compromises have had to be made .
We particularly regret one of them : it is absurd enough as it is to bring company size into play where obligations to provide information are concerned , and then on top of that , 50 is far too high a figure .
We have therefore given Parliament another opportunity to go further and have tabled an amendment proposing 20 as the threshold , well aware that actually this figure is absurd as well .
As far as the protection of certain interest groups is concerned , we really have to say once again that this is a problem in any case because , for example , the freedom of the press is not the freedom of the newspaper owner , but the freedom of journalists .
In churches too , church members have freedoms and these also need to be protected .
But when it comes to information rights , this cannot have anything to do with the protection of certain interest groups .
In German law , protection is provided for certain interest groups in joint decision making .
There is some confusion here .
If UNICE is now complaining that it is being ignored , then it ought to have cooperated constructively !
Mr President , I agree with Mrs Ghilardotti that there is a need for increased information and greater involvement of employees within companies , especially medium and large-sized ones , not least so as to avoid outright social injustices such as in the case of Renault .
Allow me nevertheless to make one or two points .
I believe in particular that it is only right to try to reconcile this legitimate expectation of information and consultation with the actual requirements of companies , above all small ones .
In an economic climate as difficult and unstable as that of Europe at the moment , it would be inadvisable to burden companies with further legal and administrative obligations .
I would point out that , at least in Italy 's case , it is only large companies which , when experiencing a crisis , quite rightly and properly receive support from the State , whereas small firms , although they too are a precious resource for the Union , do not enjoy any such privilege .
All too often , the heads of small firms have to face the uncertainties of the market all alone , shouldering all the risks without any protection or public assistance .
I would therefore point out that prior consultation of employees would be meaningful only if it were one aspect of a genuine system of participation .
What I mean is that , in a company which practises forms of participation - profit sharing or share ownership - prior consultation on company decisions is conceivable .
In this case , there is a give-and-take relationship between employer and employees : joint decision making but also joint risk taking ; the profits are shared but so are the responsibilities .
To conclude , this proposal for a Council directive , and Mrs Ghilardotti 's position in particular , introduces further elements of rigidity which the labour market - above all with regard to small businesses and micro-firms - can well do without , in my opinion .
Such elements of rigidity would certainly not encourage job creation .
Mr President , this report and the directive itself represent a very significant point in the progress of industrial relations .
However , they are still less than the participation measures recommended some time ago , in particular by the studies of the European Foundation . This body carried out a major survey in 1991 and defined the following three models of participation : participation as a productive force , participation as a democratic force and participation as a set of positive forces .
Participation is actually the main objective which we must pursue but it is just one point which Mrs Ghilardotti has made more effective , broader and more efficient .
I must draw the Commission 's attention to the fact that , in countries such as Italy , Portugal , Spain and Greece , only 5 % of managers allow consultation and information on subjects which are not exclusively related to health and safety in the workplace .
We are therefore a long way from the European citizenship and democracy which we want for everyone . Political democracy is currently kept outside the company walls .
We must hope that we can successfully implement this Commission initiative and the report which are intended to give people more freedom and make companies more productive while ensuring a greater human quality .
Mr President , I am not against minimum requirements and a common framework for informing and consulting workers .
I think that Mrs Ghilardotti has made a good effort in this direction , but I feel that , carried away by her - albeit very good - intentions , she has gone somewhat over the top .
I think that if we adopt the report as it is at the moment we may end up achieving the opposite to what we all want , which is the protection of workers .
Discouraging enterprises from making investments will , in the end , be detrimental to workers .
I hold this view because we have different legislative approaches in the various Member States . Whilst in some Member States , such as Germany and Austria , what is being stipulated here is more or less already incorporated into their law , in other Member States a sudden change in legislation and a change of standards may have an adverse effect on the economy and on the labour market .
Indeed , a positive step was taken when the original idea to implement the directive in enterprises with 20 workers was abandoned and 50 was introduced as the threshold .
Nevertheless , there are still some things in the report I regard as negative and I would like to highlight a few as illustrative examples .
Firstly , the Commission proposal provides for derogations , for example for certain specific organisations with religious and charitable aims .
Amendment No 15 rescinds Article 2 ( 2 ) , which permits such derogations .
I feel this is a mistake .
These are specific cases and therefore special provisions are required to guarantee information and consultation and the proper functioning of these organisations .
Secondly , Amendment No 24 ( new ) provides for final decisions to be postponed to allow consultations to continue so as to avoid adverse consequences for workers .
In this way , companies will be unable to take decisions , possibly for long periods of time , and thus their survival may be compromised .
Thirdly , Amendment No 26 offers workers the possibility of requesting the assistance of experts .
Experts should not take part in information and consultation meetings , since they may disclose important information to third parties , and the protection provided in Article 5 is inadequate .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I personally am going to vote against this report .
The proposal is a blatant example of a lack of respect for the principle of subsidiarity .
Firstly , there are no cross-border aspects to the proposal and , secondly , the matter is already regulated in most Member States , including my own country , Denmark , through cooperation agreements .
This question should be regulated nationally and between the social partners .
This would take account of both the principle of subsidiarity and the national differences and traditions in Europe .
There is therefore no need for more EU rules in this area .
It should be up to individual countries to establish national rules or set up agreements , as we have done in my own country .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for what is an excellent report .
I should also like to thank the Commission for its proposal .
There can be no doubt that this directive is needed , as developments during recent years have shown .
I think it is obvious that employees should be regarded as a resource .
It is therefore essential that they should have a right to consultation and information .
However , I do not think the proposal goes far enough .
In my view , 50 employees is far too high a figure - even 20 is too high .
I believe that every single employee should have the right to consultation and information .
However , I shall vote in favour of the proposal , since it establishes minimum rules .
Countries which already have better systems - like my own country , Sweden - should be able to retain them .
Therefore , all things considered , I regard this proposal as a successful step in a process whereby all employees will have the right to consultation and information in the future .
Mr President , unfortunately , the principle that if you wait for long enough the outcome will be good does not always apply in European social policy .
Many important decisions certainly take a long time , but then are not as good as we social affairs politicians would like them to be .
The question of informing , consulting and participating has been under discussion at European level since 1974 .
All the Commission initiatives were defeated in the Council , because until the Maastricht Treaty came into force , unanimity was necessary for them to be adopted .
The framework directive on the working environment was the first to include the field of information and consultation .
Then in 1994 , it became possible to adopt the EWC .
Nevertheless , constant change and increased cross-border activities mean that there is an urgent need for action to be taken on this issue .
As a result of limitations and shortcomings , workers have not been given sufficient information and opportunities to be consulted on issues that really matter for undertakings .
Admittedly - and this is true - legislation does exist at national level .
Unfortunately , this is increasingly ineffective in cases involving cross-border activities .
That is why a minimum social standard is absolutely essential in this case too .
This is nothing more than that .
In this way , subsidiarity is fully guaranteed .
After lengthy discussions in the committee , we agreed on the threshold of 50 employees .
In smaller companies , business developments are clearer and information harder to conceal .
The protection of certain interest groups has remained an open question .
The PPE Group supports it here as it did in the case of the EWC , and we are still hoping for the PSE Group 's agreement .
However , we all agree that the minimum requirements must be adhered to , as must be the case for all minimum social standards .
The right to have expert support must definitely be guaranteed , in the context of subsidiarity , because without it workers could be taken for a ride .
After 25 years , I am looking forward to this directive for the benefit of workers finally being adopted .
The idea behind this directive is also that European companies are different from American and Japanese ones , and work best if a consensus is achieved between the companies and their employees by means of information and consultation .
Mr President , I could have done without this proposal for a directive .
Unfortunately , this point of view has not gained much support in Parliament .
In Denmark , both employers and workers believe the proposal could be a time bomb under the special Danish negotiating model whereby information and consultation are regulated in agreements on works councils between the social partners .
During the committee procedure , I proposed an amendment which would have allowed Member States to refrain from implementing the directive if the social partners agreed that adequate schemes already existed .
Unfortunately , it was not adopted .
I would not like Member States which do not have adequate schemes for informing and consulting workers to be able to evade the directive .
That is why it is needed .
On the contrary , I am in favour of solidarity among workers in the EU , but at the same time I want a Member State such as Denmark - where over a period of more than 100 years the social partners have developed a successful model for information and consultation through collective agreements , in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue - to be allowed to retain such a system . Conversely , we should not prevent others from being raised to the level that we enjoy .
Mr President , I should like to see the European Parliament reject this report .
We should demonstrate that we respect the subsidiarity principle .
To incorporate the contents into European legislation might run directly counter to our desired objectives .
The proposal for a directive is at odds with the different traditions that exist in the Member States .
It is an old-fashioned idea that the unions should acquire more influence through the EU .
This should be replaced by a modern approach - which obviously means influence and participation on the part of workers - in every organisation that wishes to be competitive and dynamic .
The necessary frameworks are best devised within individual workplaces and would only be hindered by the bureaucratic superstructure of a labour market policy , for which some people would now like to use European cooperation .
Our role in a Europe in which human resources are being misused through high unemployment should be to create the right conditions for new jobs .
The introduction of more rules and restrictions would mean fewer new jobs and less growth , development and prosperity .
In other words , there would be many fewer workplaces in which there was consultation and information .
I should not like to be a party to that , and I am glad that many of those present in the House today have said the same thing .
Mr President , ever since the Community institutions first became involved in building Europe , especially social Europe , the information and consultation of employees has been a topic of substance , dating right back to the first Council documents in 1974 .
Today we are dealing once again , perhaps in an almost final version , with this fundamental matter of how to involve the basic elements of companies - in other words those who work in them , those who invest their labour to help them grow and remain competitive on the market .
Many important considerations are set out in the rapporteur 's text , for which we thank her .
In particular , it is vital to include the public sector , provided of course that the Member States create mechanisms to encourage social dialogue .
Clearly , social dialogue is especially desirable for SMEs , which appear to be excluded from this document , although - as we all know - they account for 90 % of companies in the Community .
Therefore , in agreement with the Member States - and this is crucial - we must ensure the maximum involvement of employees in small firms , or rather micro-firms , those with up to ten employees , which currently form a majority in certain economic sectors and offer the greatest potential .
The report has of course amended the initial proposal by ruling out a number of derogations on non-profit-making companies .
We agree on this aspect , as long as it is properly applied within the Member States .
In conclusion , in this age of globalisation , it would be unthinkable not to step up - and indeed to maximise - the involvement of employees in Community undertakings , because obviously business success or failure ultimately depends on them .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Ghilardotti and all the other rapporteurs for their work on this particular Commission proposal .
I also wish to thank those Members who have taken the time to make valuable contributions to this debate .
I should like to express my personal satisfaction and gratitude for your support for this very important initiative of the Commission .
It is , in our view , an important proposal , which , once adopted , could add an indispensable missing element to Community European labour law .
Having listened to what has been said here - and I have read the draft opinion - I believe you are willing and ready to play a decisive role in the negotiations leading up to the adoption of this proposed directive .
Once adopted , it will complete and make more coherent the acquis communautaire in the field of employee involvement and make a decisive contribution to building the social dimension of the internal market .
In a way Ms Oddy is right : it will fill a gap that needs to be filled in European labour law .
Nevertheless , it is a controversial proposal , which is illustrated by the reservations which employers and some Member States have expressed .
We are aware of the difficulty of the debate and that is another reason why I am particularly pleased with your position of clear support for the initiative , while having to be prudent about the caretaker Commission at the moment and what it can do with this proposal just at this time .
So while the Council has not even started discussions on the text , and taking into account the absolute need to preserve the political viability of the proposal - notably within the Council - it is wiser at this time , and particularly at this stage , to act with some caution .
I fully understand all of your requests at this time .
Most , if not all , of the issues they raise were the subject of intense debate within the Commission in the period leading up to the adoption of the proposal .
In the end the Commission reached a delicate balance between the different points of view and divergent interests on what is regarded as a very sensitive issue .
It would be inappropriate to depart from this balance at this stage , at least as regards the proposed amendments relating to the four main sensitive issues of the proposal : the thresholds , the definitions of information and consultation , the extent to which the social partners may derogate from the directive 's provisions and the question of sanctions .
I am sure that all your proposals on these central issues are going to be very much at stake in the discussions between the European Parliament and the Council leading up to the adoption of the proposal .
The Commission will play the role attributed to it by the Treaty in the course of the codecision procedure while facilitating the approximation of the positions of both parties and , in the end , ensuring consensus .
So you will understand my caution when reacting today to some of your amendments , even if some of them could certainly be envisaged by the Commission in the future , in the light of the developments that will take place in the Council .
In spite of my caution , I should like to be as positive as possible today .
Some proposed amendments can clearly be accepted by the Commission immediately , and they certainly improve the text .
This is the case for Amendments Nos 1 , 17 , 8 , 10 , the first and the third elements of Amendment No 13 , and Nos 19 and 35 .
A second category of amendments concern more substantial issues .
Nevertheless , I believe I can express my support for them as they are reasonable and do not seem to affect the delicate balance of the text .
This is the case of Amendments Nos 4 and 15 , Nos 6 and 32 - they are related to the non-aggression clause - No 16 on the level of information and consultation , No 22 - the illustrative list of issues subject to information and consultation - and the first part of No 33 , concerning the application of the principle of the directive to the public sector , which is referred to , although the proposed formula needs to be reworked somewhat .
While Amendment No 34 is wholly consistent with our approach of involving the social partners , we could not envisage that change to the basic formula used for the implementation of Community legislation .
I could , however , accept a recital based on this amendment .
As for the other amendments , in the light of the circumstances I have mentioned , the Commission feels it will be difficult to accept them .
In any case , as I have mentioned before , they will be very much present in the future institutional debates on this important proposal and so the debate on these central issues is far from being closed .
I must say to Mrs Weiler that it really is about minimum standards .
It is very important for the European social model .
As Mrs Ghilardotti said , in a way , it is all about mutual confidence between employers and employees .
I regard this particular proposal as a key piece of European labour law .
Even though I shall be watching it from afar , I will be extremely interested in the adoption of this particular piece of European legislation .
It will do an amazing amount of good for employers and employees in the development of the European social model .
I thank you for your support .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Working time
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
A4-0184 / 99 by Mr Chanterie , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 93 / 104 / EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time to cover sectors and activities excluded from that Directive ( COM ( 98 ) 0662 - C4-0715 / 98-98 / 0318 ( SYN ) ) ; -A4-0187 / 99 by Mr McMahon , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , onI.the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the organisation of working time for mobile workers performing road transport activities and for self-employed drivers ( COM ( 98 ) 0662 - C4-0716 / 98-98 / 0319 ( SYN ) ) II.the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the enforcement of seafarers ' hours of work on board ships using Community ports ( COM ( 98 ) 0662 - C4-0717 / 98-98 / 0321 ( SYN ) ) III.the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the Agreement on the organisation of working time of seafarers concluded by the European Community Shipowners ' Association ( ECSA ) and the Federation of Transport Workers ' Unions in the European Union ( FST ) ( COM ( 98 ) 0662 - C4-0718 / 98 ) .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is perhaps useful to start by saying that European legislation on working time is a matter of safety and health at work , and as such it is a right to which workers are entitled .
It was enshrined in a directive in 1993 and upheld in 1996 by the European Court of Justice .
But a number of sectors and activities have so far not been covered by this directive , namely a number of transport sectors , sea fishing and other activities at sea , and doctors in training .
We are required today to look at the legislative proposals to bring these excluded sectors within the scope of the directive .
The Commission has opted for a twin-track approach , on the one hand amending the existing horizontal directive and on the other hand putting forward three specific vertical directives for the transport sector , EU seafarers and seafarers aboard vessels entering EU ports .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has followed this dual approach , with Mr McMahon 's report on sectoral legislation and my own report on adaptation of the existing directive .
Broadly speaking , the committee favours bringing all the excluded sectors and activities within the scope of the directive .
That will require , amongst other things , a revision of Article 17 on derogations so that better account can be taken of the specific features of each of these sectors and activities .
For these reasons , I stand by my original proposal that the exclusion of seafarers should be reversed .
Like transport workers , seafarers can make use of the derogations provided for in the directive .
And maritime transport , like road transport , can have recourse to a separate directive .
There is in any case a European agreement between shipowners and unions .
So why exclude them further ?
That is not defensible in either legal or political terms .
One may even wonder if it is still defensible to single out another occupational group , the armed forces in peacetime .
I think , Commissioner , that we need answers to these questions when the directive is revised in the near future .
The second point of debate was Sunday as a day of rest .
The 1993 directive provided for this , but the 1996 judgment of the Court of Justice declared it invalid .
It is not Sunday as a day of rest as such which is being abandoned , but Sunday rest as an element of worker health and safety protection .
So Sunday as a day of rest ought not really to be abandoned .
What we need is a different legal basis to justify Sunday as a day of rest .
The European Parliament adopted a position on this in its resolution of 12 December 1996 .
That resolution calls on the Member States and the social partners too to acknowledge the special character of Sunday as a day of rest .
You backed that resolution , Commissioner , and you also confirmed it in a letter to me dated 8 January 1999 .
In seeking a solution , I would point to the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and in particular Article 151 ( 4 ) , which together with Article 128 ( 1 ) of the Maastricht Treaty provides a suitable legal basis .

A few words now on doctors in training .
I think one of the most important merits of this legislation we are now enacting is that it brings to an end the inhuman working conditions , and various abuses , which a junior doctor has to endure .
It is most important to patients too , since it has often become apparent that junior doctors who have been on duty or gone without sleep for 60 , 70 or 80 hours on the trot are often not best placed to make the right judgements when emergency intervention is required .
The European Commission 's suggestion is to allow a temporary exemption , making the limit not 48 but 54 hours , for a period of seven years .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs arrived at a compromise , to accept the extension from 48 to 54 hours but for just four years , not seven .
As we know , the United Kingdom would like to go further than that , with a derogation for 15 years , but that takes us well into the 21st century , and I think we might ask whether members of the British Government would be happy to be treated in those conditions or not .
They might prefer to go to a different hospital .
In other words , we have to discuss and vote on all these things today and tomorrow .
I believe that this , together with the Ghilardotti report , is one of the most significant pieces of social legislation we shall have produced by the end of this parliamentary term .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on bringing forward legislation for the excluded sector .
We have in front of us today a comprehensive package of proposals to protect about five million workers in road , rail and sea transport , as well as junior hospital doctors in training and offshore oil workers who are not covered under the original working time directive .
The debate today is the first step in this Parliament , following the new Amsterdam Treaty , to ensure that minimum standards of working time are established for all workers throughout Europe .
This is not an easy task .
To match minimum health and safety standards and at the same time to have some operational flexibility , which may be necessary in certain circumstances given the nature of these sectors , is not going to be easy .
We can be encouraged by the fact that the social partners reached an agreement in the rail industry and in maritime transport .
I particularly welcome the seafarers agreement , given that it was a European social model , which formed the basis of our own wider agreement in the ILO Convention 180 .
Unfortunately , when we come to the road sector , the social partners were unable to reach an agreement .
But they held important negotiations and they have learned valuable lessons .
In drafting my report , which deals with the various transport sectors , my paramount concern has been the need to protect workers against the adverse effects on their health and safety of working excessively long hours .
The report is also about ensuring safe and competitive transport systems in the interests of the general public .
If we fail to deal with the regulation of working time in the transport sector , we run the risk not only of endangering the health and safety of the workers but at the same time of distorting competition within the internal market .
This is particularly true in the road transport sector , where 78 % of transport companies are small businesses operating with less than five vehicles .
It therefore makes sense to adopt European-wide rules on working time , which will operate alongside a tachograph and will ensure a level playing-field in road transport .
I fully support , therefore , the Commission 's proposal to extend the working time rules to all mobile workers in road transport , including self-employed drivers .
These rules would protect road haulage workers , who are subcontracted out and end up becoming self-employed without any choice and without any health and safety protection .
Not only will the Commission 's legislation protect workers
