Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 20 March 2003 .
We are greatly saddened today to learn of the death after a long illness of our former colleague Mr Jos√© Aurelio de Barros Moura on 25 March 2003 .
Mr Barros Moura was a Member of this Parliament from 1986 to 1989 and then again from 1994 to 1999 in the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
He was a Vice-President of the ACP-EEC Joint Assembly .
All those colleagues who knew him and worked with him appreciated greatly his personal qualities , his good nature and his openness .
Above all , we recall him as a man of deep conviction and a strong and committed advocate of European integration .
I would ask you to rise and observe a minute 's silence .
( The House rose and observed one minute 's silence )
Mr President , you have always shown a great deal of sensitivity when people , or even one person is killed in political violence anywhere in the world .
I should like to propose , following the death today of 15 innocent people in Baghdad market and the death of soldiers on both sides , that we observe one minute 's silence for the victims of the war in Iraq .
Mr Alavanos , I think the House shares your feelings for all of the casualties and victims of this war and I hope , in the course of our debate this afternoon , that colleagues will be able to take the opportunity to express for themselves the kind of solidarity which you have shown here today .
Mr President , during the Strasbourg part-session I called on you to take up the case of a number of Cuban dissidents arrested in that country .
They are members of the Christian Liberation Movement .
A wave of new arrests took place during subsequent weeks .
Journalists , dissidents and human rights defenders were targeted .
It should be noted that all this coincides with the opening of the Commission 's permanent representation in Cuba .
It also comes at a time when many Members of the House were giving favourable consideration to extending the Cotonou Convention to include Cuba .
It may be desirable to continue dialogue with the Cuban people and their government , and to keep channels of communication open .
Nonetheless , Mr President , I appeal to you once again to take up this cause and press for the release of these Cuban journalists , dissidents and human rights defenders .
This week I communicated precisely the concerns you mentioned on the last occasion to the Ambassador of the Mission of the Republic of Cuba .
I outlined in detail our concerns and I shall forward you a copy of the correspondence .
Mr President , a large number of Members of this Parliament and of its staff are deeply affected by the war and want to express their deep sympathy with the victims .
That is why many Members of Parliament and members of staff have decided to wear black armbands during this week 's part-session .
We would ask for your understanding for this mark of solidarity with all the victims and with public opinion , which has come out against this war .
I shall speak later on the subject of Iraq but , while our attention is focused on that country , there are atrocious activities going on in other parts of the world .
I refer in particular to Zimbabwe , where in the last few days police have arrested over 500 people - including Members of Parliament - and hospitals have treated more than 250 people with serious injuries .
This is another instance in which the failure of European Union governments to speak with one voice and to implement policies with resolution has given licence to another tyrant - in this case , Mugabe .
I ask Council to redouble its efforts to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe .
Colleagues , as you know , our Rules of Procedure allow for a number of short speeches at the beginning of a sitting .
I have taken a number , but many more colleagues wish to speak .
I propose , with regard to those still wishing to speak , to invite you to make your points of order after our debate .
The presidency of the Council is present and in terms of the dignity of the House , it should be appropriate now to proceed with our business .
By letter of 7 March 2003 , Mr Olivier Dupuis requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity in a case pending before a court in Rome .
Pursuant to Rule 6 ( 3 ) of the Rules of Procedure , I have referred this request to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Mr President , one of the Members of this House , Mr Cappato , has been detained in prison for three days by the British authorities .
I would like to know whether parliamentary immunity still exists in Europe and whether being awarded the title ' European of the Year ' , as Mr Cappato has , automatically means one has to go to prison , in which case that is a competition which we would all do well not to enter .
Mr President , I want to talk about what Mr Bigliardo said and the letter you have received regarding the immunity of Mr Dupuis .

Mr Pannella too has been given a four-month jail sentence , commuted to eight months of conditional release , for civil disobedience with regard to drugs .
He has to inform the Italian authorities of all his movements and he can only come to the European Parliament in Brussels and Strasbourg for a total of seven days per month .

Mr Pannella , Mr Cappato and Mr Dupuis all subjected themselves to these sentences voluntarily without raising the question of their parliamentary immunity .
Our concern is not for them : it is for Parliament and the safeguarding of its work and its plenary sessions .
I should like to point out at this juncture that if colleagues wish to raise other cases involving the defence of parliamentary immunity , I invite them to take these cases up with the relevant committee , namely the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the outcome of the European Council of 21-22 March and on Iraq .
( Several Members on the left held up placards denouncing the war in Iraq )
We know that people are filled with intense emotion about this issue , but everyone has the right to be listened to in serenity and with respect .
I appeal to colleagues to please show that respect to the Prime Minister .
You shall have your opportunity to speak .

The European Council concluded that the slowdown in the economy had lasted longer than anticipated and that the current prospects of a recovery were overshadowed by the war , global political risks and economic uncertainties .
The European Council also concluded that considerable progress had been made with the Lisbon agenda , now entering its fourth year .
For example , five million new jobs have been created since the start of the Lisbon strategy - 500 000 of them in 2002 despite the less favourable economic climate , with unemployment declining by 2 million .
Nonetheless , there is still a lot to do in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives .
A great deal of effort is needed if we are to push ahead with our economic and social reforms .
The European Council set four priorities : to raise employment and social cohesion is the first priority .
By reforming tax and benefit systems and increasing incentives for labour market participation and incentives to encourage the labour markets to be more adaptable to changing economic conditions and , of course , by paying attention to social cohesion .
The second priority is to promote innovation and entrepreneurship .
This means increasing company expenditure on research , facilitating the creation of companies that focus on innovation , improving their access to finance , reducing administrative burdens and encouraging the spirit of enterprise among young people .
The third priority is to strengthen the single market and connect Europe .
We need to open up the European energy , transport and financial services markets and improve the regulatory framework and consumer protection .
The final priority is environmental protection for growth and jobs .
This means taking action in the environmental field and promoting new investments in clean and more resource-efficient technologies .
At this point , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to say that , as the conclusions show , considerable progress has been made with the Lisbon strategy during the Greek Presidency .
For example , significant results have been obtained as regards agreeing on better coordination of budgetary policies , agreeing on a transparent and cheap Community patent , fourteen years in the making , putting into place an integrated Europe-wide financial market , setting the direction for the revised European Employment Strategy , introducing a Tripartite Social Summit , establishing a Tripartite Social Summit , agreeing on energy taxation and setting targets in sectors such as renewable energy , increased energy efficiency and bio-fuels .
The European Council issued guidelines .
The conclusions contain guidelines on how to achieve the objectives I have mentioned .
In 2003 , the European Union will have streamlined key policy coordination instruments .
What are they ?
The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines , the Employment Guidelines and the Internal Market Strategy .
The Council ordered these tools to be streamlined and coordinated and to be given a three-year perspective , in order to make them more efficient .
The Council took a series of decisions in specific sectors , such as employment and modernising the European social model .
The Council urged the Member States to maintain the momentum of reform of national labour markets .
As I said , it stressed the need to reform tax systems in order to promote employment and increase labour demand in Europe , improve the wage and salary formation system , so that they take into account the relationship between wages , price stability , productivity , training levels and labour market conditions , modernise employment legislation , taking account of the need for both greater flexibility and greater security and improve labour mobility over occupations , sectors , regions and across borders , for example by improving transparency and recognition between systems of vocational education .
Finally , in this sector , the European Council invited the Commission to establish a special European Employment Taskforce , headed by Mr Wim Kok , to propose specific measures to increase employment .
The Council also touched on all the other sectors which constitute the Lisbon strategy : knowledge , innovation , entrepreneurship , competitiveness , and set certain deadlines for completing various reforms .
Finally , I should like to mention that it laid down substantive regulations on safety at sea in the wake of the Prestige accident .
Ladies and gentlemen , this - very briefly - was the outcome of discussions on the Lisbon strategy .
Now I should like to say something on the subject of Iraq .
It is a known fact that all the Member States of the European Union demanded the disarmament of Iraq and the destruction of any weapons of mass destruction it may have had .
It is also a known fact that there is acute disagreement as to how and when disarmament will take place .
This issue was discussed repeatedly in the Security Council without any agreement being reached .
On the contrary , the divisions widened .
It would therefore have been pointless for the Presidency to hope that the differences which have emerged over all the past few months would be overcome at the Council .
On the contrary , it felt that , with the beginning of the military conflict , principles needed to be laid down for dealing with the situation caused by the start of war and that we should be thinking about the future and the aftermath of the crisis in order to preclude new divisions , in order to set clear , common objectives , in order to limit the repercussions of the war and avoid a chain reaction of crises and in order to be able to work once the war ends .
That is our objective .
Peace and progress in the region .
At the beginning , this effort was met with doubt .
Could we discuss this sort of agenda ?
However , the Council achieved a common position , pointing out , among other things , the need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Iraq , the need to address the major humanitarian needs in the aftermath of the conflict , the need for our solidarity with the countries affected by it and the central role of the United Nations , both in dealing with the Iraqi crisis and in the international system in general .
The Security Council , the conclusions state , will need to give the United Nations a mandate to deal with the post-war period .
Another point was the need to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process , our determination to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy and the importance of the transatlantic partnership .
Is the fact that we steered clear of the main problem a sign of hypocrisy , as some have suggested ?
No , it is not .
The differences of opinion on the main problem were clear .
The impasse was also clear .
There was no point in discussing it .
We needed to focus our attention elsewhere : to what is important for the future .
And that is what we did .
Perhaps some people would have preferred to widen the gap , to add more fuel to the fire ?
We believe that , now that the war has raised even more questions , the European Union has a duty to send out a message about restoring peace in the region and dealing with the aftermath of the war .
The future is every bit as important as the present .
If we fail to address it , we shall find ourselves on a very slippery slope .
Is the Union of Europe split at the moment ?
Yes , it is .
However , the answer is not to exacerbate the divide , the answer is to try and highlight where we can work together and pull in the same direction .
The decision on Iraq was a decision based on the premise that the European Union has a voice and must have a voice in international affairs .
It is therefore a symbol of the efforts being made to create a balanced Euro-Atlantic relationship in which Europe maintains its independence , takes special initiatives and has its own role .
That we want an independent Europe is clear from another point in the conclusions referring to greater research capabilities in the defence sector and the creation of a European defence capabilities development and acquisition agency .
Ladies and gentlemen , what is our objective ?
To get international relations working in a more widely acceptable manner at international level as quickly as possible .
This presupposes that the United Nations , through its institutions , will issue the main guidelines on what is to happen after the war in Iraq .
Its reinstatement from a challenged to an unchallenged international legal system will be achieved if it is clear that the United Nations are against taking on a central role .
The decision emphasises the central role of the United Nations .
With the differences of opinion over Iraq , numerous people concluded , sadly , that we have no common foreign policy .
But that is not strictly true .
There are common positions on numerous foreign policy issues .
On other issues , and on aspects of certain more general issues , the Union 's foreign policy is taking shape .
Policies in other sectors are also taking shape .
And there are also divisions in other sectors .
From the common agricultural policy through to immigration policy .
And yet no one ever said that the European Union was superfluous because it failed to agree on the directive on working conditions for temporary agency workers or on how to deal with economic migrants seeking asylum or , finally , on changes to the Stability Pact .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is constantly taking shape .
That is why its development is a challenge , a challenge to think , to apply our knowledge and experience and work for a prosperous , secure future .
The war in Iraq , which we have to deal with , is part of that challenge , which is why we cannot merely welcome or condemn it .
We also need to look at the future prospects of Europe and the world .
Our ambition in today 's world is to put an end to war , to the reign of terror , to threats to man and his environment , by creating rules of global intergovernmentalism .
The United Nations have not yet managed to become a convincing , efficient institution , even though they are charged with addressing issues which are vital to the global community .
And it will be some time before they do .
National chauvinism is extremely powerful , which is why we have a political duty to continue to strengthen the role of the European Union , thereby helping at European and global level to consolidate the process of peace , cooperation and progress .
The Brussels Summit showed that , despite our differences , we still feel Europe is the best way of preventing one new superpower from monopolising our cosmos .
Europe 's ability to participate and influence a multipolar world must be kept alive with initiatives , cooperation and a belief in our common future .
The spring Council in Brussels may not have answered questions , but it issued guidelines which will allow us to put Europe 's role into practice , if we cooperate , if we live in harmony together , if we fight together for a multipolar world .
Mr President , as a supporter of the coalition war effort , when I displayed my poster which read ' Saddam Out ! ' , I was told by Vice-Presidents Dimitrakopoulos and Provan to remove it , as it was apparently against the Rules of the House .
Can we please have a consistent ruling on this matter ?
( Mixed reactions )
You are perfectly correct .
The ruling is that these kinds of displays should not take place inside the Chamber .
I would invite colleagues who have now made their point , which has indeed been tolerated , please to consider the decorum of the House and to remove the material on display .
Mr President , Mr President of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start with a word of thanks and appreciation to the Greek Presidency of the Council , and also , Mr Simitis , to you personally .
This time of grave crisis is one in which , rather than dividing Europe , it needs to be brought together , and it is evident that that is what is in your mind .
As this Europe of ours does not belong to any one party family alone , but is our common possession , what I desire for you and for us all , gathered here , is that , in the remaining weeks of your Presidency , you will be successful in guiding this European Union in the right direction for the future !
( Applause from the right )
At this time , we think of the coalition troops in Iraq , some 30 000 of them from a Member State of the European Union .
Human dignity being indivisible , though , we think also of the Iraqi soldiers who are being misused by a criminal regime .
I hope that what was so well expressed in the Conclusions of the summit here in Brussels will indeed come to pass , and that all Iraqis will very soon be allowed to live in freedom , dignity and prosperity under a representative government that will be at peace with its neighbours and an active member of the international community .
That must be our objective , and we Europeans must not opt out at this stage but , together , united and with determination , must make our own effective contribution to giving peace in the Middle East a chance .
Although there are differences of opinion in our group , as there were before the war , the great majority of us take the view that there is one thing we should be saying to our American friends .
It is that , whilst international institutions such as the United Nations , NATO , and , of course , this integrated European structure , the European Union , may have their faults , because they are manned by human beings , we do agree that they have a vision for the future , and , no matter what the imperfections of these structures of peace , we will not allow anyone to jeopardise these institutions , the basis of whose existence is beyond question !
Richard Perle has said that both the UN and NATO had lost their contemporary relevance and were meaningless in the twenty-first century .
I would like to respond to that by saying that , if we ourselves put a question mark against the North Atlantic Alliance , what are we actually saying to the peoples of central Europe , to the Poles , and to the Slovenes , who have just held their referendum ?
That is where they are seeking security in the face of threats !
That is why we have to give some thought to how to improve these institutions , but we must not question their existence .
( Applause from the right )
We do , of course , need proper trans-Atlantic relations and a trans-Atlantic partnership .
Nobody is in any doubt about my position on the Iraq issue , and that is why I tell our American friends that the European Union is also in the American interest .
Americans should not see relations with Europe solely in terms of relations between the USA and France , the USA and Great Britain , the USA and Germany , the USA and Greece , the USA and all the others .
We will soon be meeting them again in the forum of the World Trade Organisation , where the European Union must - and will - present a united front .
Hence my plea to our American friends that they take the European Union seriously .
It is our way of strengthening our influence in the world ; it is our way of living at peace with one another and maintaining good , well-ordered , relations with the United States of America on the basis of partnership !
( Applause from the right )
The President of the Commission has praised the Belgian initiative on defence policy .
I spent ten years as chairman of this Parliament 's security and disarmament sub-committee , so I know what I am talking about when I say that I very much support what they are trying to do , but am not sure that having a meeting of the few here in Belgium is the right way to go about it .
We were highly critical when the British Prime Minister sent out invitations to dinner at No 10 Downing Street , with some being invited and others not .
If that sort of thing catches on even in the Benelux states , then my great fear is that we will end up with new communities forming in the south , in the east , in the west , communities of Social Democrats , communities of Christian Democrats , some of them overlapping .
We must make use of the Community institutions and work together in them !
( Applause from the right )
Let me make a few comments on the Lisbon process ; while I am grateful to the President of the European Council for mentioning this topic , we have for some time regarded as excessively bombastic the statement that we are to become a best economic area in the world .
It always reminds us a bit of Nikita Khrushchev , who , in the 1960s , always wanted to overtake the USA , and we know what the result was !
The goal is the right one , but what now matters is that the instruments be brought into play , and this is where a number of Member States are not doing what has to be done .
I would have liked more to have been said about monetary stability .
A lot is being said about the Stability Pact 's flexibility .
Let us just consider what the Euro is worth to us today .
Let us imagine what things would be like if it did not exist - how then would our currencies be valued in relation to each other today ?
It is for that reason that we must defend the common European currency , and we need it to be a stable one .
What is of pre-eminent importance is globalisation , which is often decried - sometimes rightly , sometimes wrongly .
Big businesses are able to seek out for themselves a business location where taxes are at their lowest , which small and medium-sized enterprises cannot do .
It follows that structural reforms must be of such a nature as to enable small and medium-sized firms to invest , taxes to be cut and jobs to be thereby created .
This is where governments must take some action at last !
Please allow me to make two comments by way of conclusion .
I hope that a statute for European political parties will come about before the end of the Greek Presidency , and , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I urge you to ensure that we achieve a result on the issue of the financial package with the prospect of enlargement .
We will not accept any curtailment of Parliament 's rights as regards the Budget , but nor do we want to delay enlargement ; we want to keep to the timetable .
We wish you success in your efforts to do this .
To the President of the Commission , too , I make the plea that we should now do everything possible to maintain Parliament 's rights and prevent discrimination against the candidate countries .
For these things we will continue to campaign , and we ask that you put them into practice .
Then , success will be ours under the Greek Presidency of the Council , a success that I wish , not only for you , but also for us all , and from the bottom of my heart .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the courage and resolution it displayed during its second summit .
In the light of recent events I fear it may yet be called upon to convene further summits .
On behalf of my group , I should like to express our heartfelt condolences to the families of all the victims of this war .
There must be no more victims .
My group therefore believes the war must cease immediately .
The United Nations must assume management of the conflict .
The latter should never have been taken out of the United Nations framework .
I also deeply regret the unilateral decision taken by the President of the United States to leave this framework and start a war .
I support Mr Annan .
Once again , I must emphasise that the present unilateral action is in breach of the United Nations Charter and of international law .
On behalf of my group I should like to further reiterate our complete opposition to the doctrine of pre-emptive attack as an instrument of foreign policy .
( Applause )
I would like to repeat what Mr Cook said in the House of Commons .
Multilateral agreements and a world order governed by rules afford better protection to our British and European interests than unilateral instruments .
From President Carter to the Pope , countless individuals around the world endorse this view .
Mr Poettering quoted Mr Perle , a spokesperson for the armaments industry .
Mr Perle is a shameless lobbyist .
He wrote an article thanking God for the failure of the UN .
Given that so many are swearing by some God 's name or taking it in vain , I should like to seize this opportunity of sending out a timely reminder .
There is a fallen angel in both the Bible and the Koran .
The fallen angels , who were angels of light , are named Lucifer and Iblis respectively .
Their fall was caused by pride and unbridled blind arrogance .
That is the very situation we are currently faced with .
( Applause )
Ladies and gentlemen , no war is a clean war .
The doctored images presented to us conceal horror .
We are today receiving pictures of that market in Baghdad .
You will recall that the European Union evolved from a common market .
No doubt you also recall another market , in Sarajevo , and how that was bombed .
I hope your consciences are stirred .
We are all involved in a conflict which is becoming increasingly horrific .
Clearly , large numbers of Iraqis long for a future without Saddam Hussein 's oppressive regime .
They wish to enjoy freedom and dignity .
Clearly too , they do not wish to have further death and destruction inflicted on them .
This action was taken unilaterally , outside the framework of the Security Council .
It has resulted in disaster , because very often the local population does not perceive the troops as a liberating force .
The people are determined to protect what is theirs , to defend their land .
Furthermore , this region is beset by many complex problems .
It is most unwise to destabilise it further , and this could impact the Middle East process .
Both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have insisted that this crisis and future action must be dealt with within the UN framework .
I could not agree more .
Indeed , I have said so twice already in this House .
I have , however , read today 's newspaper and apparently the management of the port of Umm Qasar has been awarded to a United States company .
The latter is offering to subcontract some of the work to European companies .
This flies in the face of respect for the UN .
Is the European Union to be invited to do subcontract work for the UN ?
That is not the way forward .
I believe we should make our voice heard .
We must insist on humanitarian aid being administered in a civilian framework , and furthermore , within the UN framework .
Aid must not be administered by any of the powers currently involved .
( Applause )
I should like to make a final point before I finish and leave the floor to my colleague Mr Goebbels .
He will speak on the Spring Council .
My point is as follows . We know the President of the United States has already estimated the cost of the war at USD 75 000 million per month .
Oil prices and exchange rates are on a roller coaster .
President-in-Office of the Council , I very much fear that if this state of affairs continues you will be forced to convene a further summit to assess the European and world economies .
In conclusion , Mr President , we have to recognise that public opinion is riven by emotion .
It is disconcerted and overwhelmingly opposed to this war .
I refer to wider public opinion , not just to European public opinion .
The public does not understand the urgency of this war or the reasons for it .
There is a world-wide movement for peace .
I have in mind Saturday 's demonstration .
It falls to us to relaunch the multilateral approach to international relations .
The dignity and legitimacy of the United Nations must be restored .
It will then be in a position to fulfil its role as a government for the world .
The European Union failed to act as one and therefore bears a share of the responsibility for this crisis .
We must be able to envisage a future in which the Union can construct a foreign and security policy worthy of the name .
This is essential if we are to act honourably in the interest of the future of all humankind .
( Applause )
Mr President , the war with Iraq inevitably overshadowed the Council 's important economic reform agenda .
It is only natural that , at such a time , economic issues should take second place to matters of life and death .
However , given the negative economic impact that the conflict could have on the Union 's economy , we must not take our eyes off the ball and let the economic reforms that are needed to revitalise our economy fall further behind .
So before turning to the conflict with Iraq , I will say a few words about economic reform .
The truth is that the process of economic reform is running into the sand ; with the European Union set to enlarge to 25 countries , we will have to run just to stand still .
I should like to cite just three examples .
First , at 1.9 % of GDP , our investment in research and development is well below levels in the USA and Japan , and with only two of the accession countries spending more than 1 % of GDP on research and development , we will be hard pressed to reach the 3 % Lisbon target by 2010 .
My second example is taken from the Barcelona Council , where Europe 's leaders committed themselves to cutting the percentage of single market laws not yet implemented to less than 1.5 % - instead , the proportion rose last year to over 2 % .
As the incoming Member States will naturally face some teething problems in implementing law in the early years , this implementation deficit is in danger of growing further if we do not redouble our efforts .
Progress will certainly not be achieved if others emulate the tactics used by Mr Berlusconi in his shameful attempt to defend illegal milk subsidies at the expense of a deal on the taxation of savings .
That hardly augurs well for the Italian presidency .
And third : raising levels of employment .
It is impressive that we managed to create half a million jobs last year despite the economic slowdown .
But the scale of the task ahead becomes clear when we note that unemployment in the EU as a whole rose last year to nearly 8 % .
On the issue of jobs , the Council appears to have followed the age-old practice : ' If in doubt , create a task force ' .
I wish Wim Kok well in his work , but it is hard to see what answers he can come up with which are better than the tried and trusted recipe of reducing the burden of taxes on labour and increasing market flexibility .
On Iraq , I welcome the forward-looking nature of the European Council conclusions , brokered by the President-in-Office , and their focus on humanitarian assistance , on rebuilding Iraq and the central role to be played in this by the United Nations .
Humanitarian aid must get through .
We see from the situation in Basra just how important that is .
The horror transmitted through our television screens shows us just how necessary it is to get our relief agencies in and working .
I welcome Mr Prodi 's proposal for EUR 3 million of immediate humanitarian aid through the Red Cross .
Liberal Democrats will support the rapid approval by our House of your request for the release of a further EUR 70 million from the emergency budget reserve .
The EU has been damaged by the divisions of recent weeks .
This could presage a new effort to heal the political wounds , but it is hard not to agree with the Luxembourg Prime Minister when he says that problems cannot be resolved unless they are discussed .
I agree with the Council that we need to strengthen transatlantic relations .
Our dialogue must be extended to cover reform of the United Nations and the role of international law , but the United States must accept that nothing durable can be established without institutions and rules .
My group also welcomes Belgium 's proposal for a ministerial meeting on North Korea .
If the situation in Iraq had been discussed at the Seville Summit - as Mr Verhofstadt proposed - we might not be at sixes and sevens today .
We must wait and see whether 2003 is an annus mirabilis or an annus horribilis for the European Union , but since we are now in the Year of the Goat , I would congratulate the Greek Presidency on its tenacity , persistence and determination in pushing through its agenda .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Simitis , the President-in-Office of the Council , quoted the statement from the summit to the effect that Iraq 's territorial integrity must be maintained .
I do believe though - and hence my dissatisfaction - that you ought also to have mentioned that this territorial integrity is at this very moment under the most massive attack and that our most important task is to end this war .
It is my belief that we can see , from day to day , how it is becoming more evident that this war is becoming ever more inhuman and more contrary to international law .
For Mr Rumsfeld , the American Secretary for Defence , to describe it - as he did yesterday - as a humanitarian act , is something I can regard only as cynicism of a fairly barbarous kind .
I believe that when the USA started the war a week ago , it mounted an assault on the most important principle of law for civilised nations , that being the obligation to resolve conflicts by peaceful means .
This is a tragedy , particularly because this was not merely an instance of obligations and international law being violated , but also because it wrecked a great and outstanding opportunity for effective peacemaking .
I believe that any common foreign policy on the part of the European Union - something that has again been referred to today - must be not merely common , but also an alternative , countering the USA 's unilateralism , military power politics , and disregard for law and treaties with a strengthened United Nations , with the defence of the UN Charter , of international law and of the international ban on the use of force .
Any such policy must deal with conflicts - not only the specific conflicts themselves , but also their causes - and promote cooperation across the board .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like right now - and without repeating too much - to draw your attention to three primary problems .
For a start , my group continues to insist that this war be brought to an immediate end .
Even though the numbers of the civilians and soldiers wounded or killed by bombs and other military measures are bad enough , neither the statements by the Council , nor the statements to the press , nor the statistics make any reference to the thousands of Iraqi children who are dying even now as a consequence of this war .
Secondly , there is no doubt that this war puts the USA in breach of international law .
It is even now openly threatening to break international law again .
Last week , and quite openly , Mr Rumsfeld , the Secretary for Defence , ordered that the armed forces in the Gulf region be equipped with CS gas .
You are well aware , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that there is no exception to the ban on the use in armed conflict even of non-lethal gases such as CS gas , contained both in the Geneva Protocol and in Article 1 of the Chemical Weapons Convention .
I call upon you to object to the US administration 's disregard and violation of such crucial international treaties , and to do so in unmistakeable terms .
Thirdly , in Iraq there are tens of thousands of Iranians opposed to the regime in their own country , as well as Kurdish refugees from Turkey .
Lingering in refugee camps , their fate attracts no international attention .
They are very much at risk from this war and the threat of massacre hangs over them .
I beg you to ensure that their plight becomes public knowledge , and to tell your Iranian , Turkish , American and British partners that the European Union will keep a close eye on what becomes of these people .
Above all , Mr Simitis , have the courage to demand that the USA put an end to this war !
Mr President , I recently attended a debate at a school in Germany . To my surprise , I was faced with a banner reminiscent of demonstrations my contemporaries and I were involved in , back in the mists of time .
Emblazoned on this banner was a text to the effect that making war to preserve peace is like making love to preserve your virginity .
I have not quoted the exact English version so as to preserve some elegance .
I am sure none of you will have difficulty understanding it .
Mr President , you are quite right when you say this war is an intellectual challenge . I would add that it is also a physical one .
Plainly , we are allowing our divisions to stunt our intellectual faculties . It is also plain that a number of Council declarations have a surreal quality .
So too have statements made by Members of this House .
Plainly too , we are all in favour of humanitarian aid . That is the one point on which there is general consensus , and on this I agree with Mr Watson .
That much is clear .
The issue we are confronted with today is quite straightforward , however . Will Parliament make a clear statement on this war or will it not ?
Will Parliament be tarred with the same brush as the Council of Ministers or the General Affairs Council or will we achieve a majority tomorrow ?
I appeal to those who do not want a majority at any price .
I urge them to stop and think .
The choice is between two clearly defined positions .
One is the stance taken by the coalition of those in favour of the war because they believe it is important and necessary , as has just been stated . They can go ahead and vote for a resolution that might read as follows .
Carry on the good work Mr Rumsfeld , or any other like-minded person .
Right is on your side . Off you go , in the name of God , liberate the planet and show how to make love without losing one 's virginity .
They have every right to do so .
The second position involves obtaining a majority in this House to reject war as an option . Such a majority was achieved at the end of January when the war was declared illegal .
( Applause )
Accommodation will be called for in order to obtain a majority against the war .
If we are unable to make compromises we shall show ourselves to be as intellectually stunted as the Brussels Council .
That is the problem confronting us today .
It is actually quite easy to solve .
Some state that the war was not sanctioned by the United Nations . Others state it is neither legal nor legitimate .
I maintain it all comes to the same thing , and that only honourable Members skilled in hair-splitting could come up with differences in meaning between these various phrases .
Obviously , having established that the war does not have the backing of the United Nations , it can be said to lack legitimacy .
Consequently if this motion is passed , we will have notched up a victory . That much is plain .
Turning to the text of the resolution , a heated debate is in progress over the form of words . It concerns whether to express deep regret or condemnation of the fact that the United Kingdom , the United States , Spain , Italy , Poland and several other states I cannot recall should have unilaterally decided war was justified and gone ahead .
In my view , what needs to be made plain in this resolution is that inspections should have been continued and that we are opposed to those who put an end to them and resorted to war .
I do not therefore believe it is a matter of vocabulary .
I should like to make one further point quite clear before I conclude .
Some Heads of Government are intent on keeping certain lies alive .
The reason why the Security Council did not vote for the resolution tabled by the United States , United Kingdom and Spain was not a French or Russian veto . The reason was that there was no moral majority in the Security Council in favour of going to war .
That is the plain truth !
( Applause )
On this basis Chile and Mexico had the courage to table a resolution which rightly retained inspections as the way forward . It should be borne in mind that both these countries are economically dependent on the United States .
The House must therefore understand that when it votes tomorrow , it will also be sending out a message on that carefully nurtured lie perpetuated by the UK and Spanish Foreign Ministers and several others .
The moral majority that emerged on the Security Council in favour of intervention in Kosovo was 13 to 2 . No such majority emerged in favour of intervention in Iraq .
That is a historical fact .
The rest is simply a brazen lie kept alive by Heads of Government afraid of their own people .
One must call a spade a spade .
Finally , I have to say how much I hope the House will have the good sense to vote tomorrow in such a way as to make it plain that the advocates of war have been overcome and relegated to the minority .
If we win , we will have won a greater battle than a mere battle of words . Each group will then be able to resort to its ideology to defend the common view .
If we are prepared to make compromises I am confident we can win this moral victory over the advocates of war tomorrow .
( Applause )
Mr President , we cannot deny for one moment that the last number of weeks have portrayed the European Union in a very poor light .
Consensus building - which is at the centre of policies being pursued by the Greek Presidency - could not become a reality because of the polarised viewpoints on the war in Iraq taken by different countries in Europe .
The Greek Government tried valiantly to secure a common political position on Iraq and Europe , but notwithstanding its tenacious and determined efforts , this objective could not be secured .
The Greek Government must be commended for the measured approach it has taken during this very turbulent time for the European Union .
In very simple and blunt terms , we are here today to try and pick up the pieces after what has been a bruising experience for all Member States within the European Union .
We must remember that the European Union has been through difficulties before and has always managed to rebuild itself in the face of adversity .
This is the core of the challenges we now face .
The European Union has brought political stability to the people of Europe for over 50 years .
We must not , and cannot , lose sight of this fact , but we must look at the bigger picture .
The European Union as a political and economic entity has brought prosperity and a sense of political purpose to the people of Europe .
We have an internal market , we have a single European currency and the European Union is shortly to increase in size to 25 Member States .
These are all real political achievements which are contributing to the standard of living and the quality of life for many people in Europe .
We can all be proud of these achievements because we all played a key role in making them a reality .
The events of the last few weeks have rocked the European Union to its foundation .
We must now ensure that we pick ourselves up from this position and play a central role in providing all the necessary humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq over the coming months .
I welcome the conclusions of the Brussels summit and the commitment of the European Union to rebuild bridges with America and to support the transatlantic relationship .
America and Europe can achieve so much across a range of measures when they work together , as opposed to working against the interests of one another .
We must try to rebuild this relationship as a matter of urgency .
The European Union must carry out its moral political duties in ensuring that the humanitarian problems of Iraq are addressed with vigour and determination .
We must continue to work with the United Nations , whose authority has also been very badly shaken in recent times .
Like many others here today , I greatly wish for a speedy end to the war in Iraq .
The atmosphere here today is muted , but that must not disguise the fact that the European Union does have a lead role to play in ensuring that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people will be fully addressed .
This is our duty , a duty which , last week , the EU leaders recognised must be faced up to .
I believe the European Parliament must take a similar political position here today .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Prodi , ladies and gentlemen , after his brilliant , impressive digression , a theological thesis raising the issue at the heart of the discussions of the Byzantine theologians on the sex of angels - how to make love while still remaining a virgin - Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit moved on to his other pet subject , his desire for a moral majority to be achieved in this House tomorrow .
Why not say ethical , Dany ?
Tomorrow , our task will be not to seek a humble , secular political majority on specific objectives , but rather to build a moral majority in this House .
Go and get yourselves killed with your ethics , with your morals , with your quests for absolutes , with your digressions !
Our secular - or Christian if you prefer - task is to find for us all , tomorrow , as we are doing in Italy by identifying one or two feasible political objectives for the future , a path which will make it possible , instead of staying in your 1938 Munich world , Dany , to go to a world where , at the weekend , we will all fight together for free Italians , free Germans or free Iraqis , instead of sacrificing everything to the moloch of peace , to the moloch of an absolute whose boundaries you are totally unable to define .
Of course we want peace , but not the ' rest in peace ' kind !
And death does not start with American or Israeli missiles or guns ; death starts with all the victims of Pol Pot , with all those whom you do not even remember , with the peoples of the Volga and Don rivers deported 80 years ago , with the 500 thousand killed and massacred by Saddam in the last 10 years .
All your moralising , all your absolutes !
I accept , I am pleased that some Communists are turning and are changing from Communists to Liberals , but I do not accept that they should expect to continue to condemn me , as they did as Communists , accusing me of not being liberal enough or non-violent enough . Me !
I would propose an amendment to your motion , Mr President , an amendment which , at this time in Italy - and I would also point this out to the President-in-Office of the Council so that he considers it - has obtained an absolute majority of Italian MPs : a simple proposal , that is , to make the goal of a free Iraq the subject of negotiations , even with Saddam , negotiations possible here and now , as President Mubarak , Tony Blair and others , secularly and with humility and courage , say they want .

Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , when we debated the Iraqi crisis in Strasbourg a fortnight ago , there was still an albeit faint hope that it would in the end prove possible to avoid violence and to exhaust every means for a peaceful settlement of the problems , as set out in the relevant Security Council resolutions , especially Resolution 1441 .
Unfortunately , this hope was dashed by the so-called new strategic dogma , and global public opinion is witnessing a military conflict which , over and above its uniformed and civilian casualties , to all of whom we pay our respects , has inflicted collateral damage on basic institutions and parameters of international life such as the UN , the guardian of the fundamental prerogatives of the international system of law , transatlantic relations , which are indispensable to international equilibrium and , finally , the cohesion of the European Union , at least in the foreign policy sector , which is vital if it is to have a decisive presence on the international stage .
All these institutional factors have been seriously damaged and are being severely tested , in such a way that their future , or at least their ability to play their particular role in international events efficiently , still hangs in the balance ; they have to face up to a great many unpleasant truths both now and in the long term , the most important of which , of course , is the fact that the authority and the very essence of the UN have been undermined and those who favour unilateralism and high-handedness over logic and legality when acting to resolve what are doubtless very real problems have left its principles and rules in tatters .
It is no use confining ourselves to a diagnosis of the current tragic situation and a prognosis of its inauspicious prospects , however .
On the contrary , we need to turn our attention to the future and support the overwhelming majority of nations and governments by trying , even before the war ends - which we all hope will be sooner rather than later - to restore the prestige of the United Nations , which will undertake to restore normal conditions in Iraq , strengthen the transatlantic relationship within a framework of cooperation and on an absolutely equal footing and consolidate European unity , so that the sad events we have witnessed over the last few days never act as a future precedent and are consigned to history as an example to be avoided .
You shall have to do a report to answer that question , Mr Goebbels .
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to endorse the statements made by Mr Watson , the leader of my group .
I join with him in condemning the conflict in Iraq and calling for agreements within the framework of the United Nations , of course .
I also join with him in wishing to commit the European Union to regaining its unity .
The Union must then contribute to rebuilding the affected areas so a process of peace and stability can actually be consolidated and guaranteed .
The European Union was unable to demonstrate the unity required .
Sadly , it was therefore unable to exert its influence as we had hoped .
I trust that at least we shall now be capable of first regaining our unity and then of leading the peace .
I should also like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results of the Brussels Council held last week .
The Council was devoted in particular to consideration of the so-called Lisbon process .
During debates and discussion at Strasbourg it had already emerged that we have little to congratulate ourselves on in this regard .
In terms of productivity and competitiveness , the gap between Europe and the United States has not narrowed .
On the contrary , it is now actually widening .
As we understand it , the reason is that the appropriate structural reforms were not carried out .
Also , the discipline promised concerning key aspects such as the promotion of research and development activities failed to materialise .
New enterprises capable of taking on board innovation and new technological processes were not encouraged either .
Obviously , all this has hampered the development hoped for .
I believe the secret of effective implementation of the Lisbon process commitments lies in the area of structural reform .
It is equally important to promote research and development activities and the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises , in conjunction with proposals for social improvements .
Mr President , at this Spring Summit the Council needed to show itself capable of reversing its neoliberal political guidelines and to adopt a policy that gives priority to employment , public investment , inclusion and economic and social cohesion , in order to address the economic slowdown , unemployment , poverty and social exclusion , which remain at high levels in the European Union .
Unfortunately , it did not do so .
Instead of halting the process of liberalising essential public sectors and services , it has followed the agenda of the Union of Industrial and Employers ' Confederations of Europe ( UNICE ) and insists on accelerating economic reforms based mainly on speeding up the process of liberalisation in sectors and services , on the competitiveness of undertakings , on stepping up the coordination of budgetary policies and on the strategy of the Single Market , continually relegating the social sphere to second place , subordinating the objectives of the labour market , education and society to the entrepreneurial spirit , and insisting on the rapid inclusion of pensions in the financial services action plan , opening the way to their privatisation .
In this way , it waters down principles laid down in the Treaty and impedes their implementation , specifically in the fields of economic and social cohesion , solidarity , environmental protection , public health and food safety , public services and social rights , sustainable development and the quality of life , which is unacceptable .
Instead of suspending the Stability Pact in order to review the irrational criteria for nominal convergence and committing to a policy of economic development that is capable of addressing international uncertainty and instability , which has been made worse by the unjust , illegitimate and illegal war against Iraq , the Council is reaffirming the need for these objectives to be met .
It is thereby sweeping under the carpet the serious difficulties facing some Member States and the serious social and economic consequences caused by the obsession with cutting investment and public spending , preventing objectives for creating high-quality jobs from being attained and increasing social tensions and labour instability .
Even when the Council acknowledges the need to present a declaration on services of general interest , it postpones drawing up such a document until the next Competition Council , thereby forcing these services to obey the rules of competition , which is not acceptable because this heightens social inequalities .
Instead of implementing urgent measures , as Parliament called for during the last part-session in Strasbourg , to address the increase in restructuring , relocations and closures by European and multinational companies , which are making thousands of workers redundant and which call into question the regional development of huge areas in crisis where there are few alternatives forms of employment , the Council has opted to attach absolute priority to companies ' competitiveness , insisting on structural reforms of the labour market , on worker mobility and on making labour more flexible and precarious in order to adapt to the current economic climate .
Hence the question remains as to the rationale for creating the working group on employment : I would like the Council to explain whether this has been done to allay the concern in the minds of those people who still retain a modicum of sensitivity to the problems of millions of unemployed or whether the intention is simply to shape the implementation of the European employment strategy in order to facilitate the implementation of its increasingly neoliberal guidelines .
Mr President , I should like first of all to recall the forgotten Iraqi victims , especially the young people , who have been the victims of a militaristic government , of an empire that is in decline rather than at its zenith .
George Bush , the president of the United States Government , is himself the clearest indication of the crisis in that country .
This Parliament must not fall in with the logic of war ; it must call for the UN General Assembly to convene immediately in order to demand a cease-fire .
As a Galician , and as a citizen of the Spanish State , I wish to speak out against Jose Maria Aznar , a prime minister who is disloyally calling the European Union into question .
He is a prime minister who ridiculously believes himself to be a key player , together with Bush and Blair , in a new Yalta , this time held in the Azores .
His attitude is ridiculous and paranoid .
He is a prime minister who , one hundred years on , wants to turn the Spanish State into a new colony of the United States ; into a new Puerto Rico .
Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming some of the conclusions of the European Council , but I would also like to caution or criticise others .
The purpose of the Spring Council was clear at the outset : it was to be an economic forum , an opportunity to review the stage we had reached and also to chart out a new way for the future , in particular by looking again at the Lisbon strategy and establishing what alterations had to be made for us to continue to move towards that target .
It should also be an opportunity to focus on continuing the development of economic growth and employment and also guaranteeing quality of life , quality jobs and pension entitlements for all people across the EU .
As we all know , economic uncertainties and global political risks confront us and make alterations difficult .
We in the European Union should recognise that our hands are tied , to a certain extent , to the kind of things that we can achieve .
However , there are opportunities within our system that allow us to build on the positive developments .
Economic and social dimensions are intertwined in reaching the 2010 objectives .
To create and sustain jobs , the European Union must become the most competitive economic area in the world and I am delighted to welcome the Council 's decision to establish the Competitiveness Council .
Alongside this , the whole question of education and the kind of skills training that is given to people must be brought into focus .
Areas of literacy , digital developments , vocational training and lifelong learning must be seen as key parts of the package to give the people of Europe the necessary tools to be able to meet with the demands of an ever-changing economic environment .
We must be enterprise-friendly .
We must be more flexibility-friendly , not setting down rigid regulations and rules which drive economic investment out of the European Union , sending it to low-cost labour areas .
We must also ensure that the Commission is held to task with regard to the impact assessment it carries out on proposing legislation and the effect it will have on an industry .
Employment is the one way that we can guarantee overcoming poverty and social disadvantage .
However , not just any kind of employment will achieve that .
It is the quality of jobs and the quality of entitlements that will make it happen .
Social partnership has proven itself as a model with regard to how we can overcome difficulties in the workplace , ensuring proper representation for workers and also guaranteeing that enterprises have the freedom and flexibility to move forward .
There are two other points that I want to make very briefly .
First of all , one of the key elements must be protection of our environment .
We must ensure that when we hand down our countries and our continent to future generations , they are in a better condition than they were in when we inherited them .
The last point I wish to make is one of a personal nature with regard to Iraq .
Whatever we feel about the rights or wrongs of the conflict in Iraq , the most important thing to do now - and I congratulate the Greek Presidency on trying to achieve a consensus on this - is to bring all of Europe together with regard to humanitarian aid , facilitating the rebuilding of Iraq and ensuring that its people have the right tools to make their own decisions .
Mr President , depressing - that is the word that best describes the situation in the European Union last week , with Member States showing a complete lack of mutual respect , and a growing gap between old allies .
The unfortunate proposals that were publicised on the margins of the Council of Europe simply in order to keep tagging along with a small group of sympathisers made the discord even worse .
In these circumstances in particular , it was surprising and positive that the Member States were actually able to issue a joint , forward-looking declaration on Iraq in which the European Union also exhibits a sense of responsibility by promising both humanitarian aid and implicit help in reconstructing the country .
I compliment the Greek Presidency , which was able to sneak that in by concentrating on what was politically achievable .
I call on the Commission to put forward concrete proposals for both kinds of aid as soon as possible .
The declaration on the territorial integrity of Mesopotamia is of particular importance , as this is currently threatened by Turkey 's plans to enter Iraq .
What means does the Council plan to use to prevent Turkey from doing this ?
I fear that political pressure alone will not be enough .
Is the Council also willing to impose far-reaching political or economic sanctions against Turkey if the Turks actually cross the Iraqi border ?
I for my part think these should include postponing or abandoning her accession to Europe .
Finally , the declaration shows great appreciation of the United Nations .
I would , however , like to emphasise that this organisation cannot operate unless all , and I repeat all members ( particularly of the Security Council ) take responsibility for the actual enforcement of the international rule of law and the continuity of UN resolutions .
Inflexibility and an unwillingness to compromise are really not the sole preserve of the Americans .
In the light of the events of the past few weeks , I therefore find Europe 's devotion to the UN painfully hollow .
Mr President , the Spring Summit was held under very difficult circumstances .
I will not mention the situation in Iraq because my group chairman has already done so and my fellow countryman and colleague Arie Oostlander will be doing so .
I will therefore concentrate on the socio-economic aspect .
It is clear that the uncertainty about the consequences of the war and its duration will have and is having an impact on the world economy .
I think , however , that we must also realise that the growth in unemployment in Europe naturally started long before that .
One of the reasons for this is , of course , the lack of structural reforms in the European economy and the fact that necessary measures have been postponed for too long .
In this regard I was nevertheless enormously shocked when I saw the scoreboard which the European Commission - and bravo for doing so - has for the first time added to the documents that contained an evaluation relating to Lisbon .
If you allow that to sink in , you realise that there is an enormous gap between the words and decisions being taken on the one hand and their implementation on the other .
I think that the Spring Summit should have given at least as much priority to restoring confidence in the European economy , in terms of what is agreed at policy level .
I must say that the Spring Summit delivered more than I had anticipated .
So in this spirit , I would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency .
What really matters now , however , is its implementation , and that is why my group - and I am pleased to see that this has also been adopted by other groups - has proposed compiling a roadmap in which the European Commission sets out in more detail what steps need to be taken in order to achieve the Lisbon targets by 2010 .
I therefore hope that the Commission - and I am also looking at the President , Mr Prodi - will be able to produce such a roadmap by October 2003 , so that we can get a more accurate idea of what must happen in the future .
That is all the more necessary on account of our impending enlargement and because the Lisbon targets will , of course , soon have to be achieved in a much bigger European Union , and I think that it would be useful to keep an eye on that .
We acknowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises have a significant role to play in the area of employment .
We now need to actually implement the charter we established for SMEs , for example , but also the action plan for the simplification of regulation .
We have been talking about the need to make it easier for SMEs to access investment capital for so long now .
Why do we not do it , why can we not just get rid of these obstructions ?
We have formulated a fine target of 3 % of the GNP for research and development , public and private , by 2010 , and rightly so , but we need to finalise this too , as some Member States will already be above 4-5 % by then and others will still be a long way off .
How are we going to close this gap , and what efforts will have to be made by the various Member States ?
We are in favour of the open coordination method , but that is not enough , and the European Parliament and the national parliaments will also have to be involved in this .
If I may be permitted to summarise , I would like to say that we are on the right track , but it would in particular be to the Commission 's credit if we could convert our good intentions into roadmaps in order to create concrete handholds that enable us to evaluate where we stand and evaluate our progress together every year and in order to prevent the Member States from hiding behind fine words .
It is now time for deeds .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , as the President-in-Office pointed out , the purpose of the spring Councils is to examine and promote the European economy .
The state of war which surrounds us at present and which has been imposed on us not by the Americans , not by the American nation or the American people , but by the Bush administration , with its unilateral and arrogant policy , and by a number of European governments which took it upon themselves to split the European Union , is in danger of distracting us from our set programme .
For our part , keeping our eye firmly on the long-term programme of the European Union is not a formalistic policy , it is a way of maintaining and starting to restore the seriously damaged union of Europe .
When you want unity , you do not start , nor should you start with what divides you ; you start with what unites you .
And however much our foreign policy divides us at the moment , our economic policy is equally well able to unite us .
If we are to achieve this truly admirable and ambitious objective , we must make the macro-economy work more efficiently , integrate the financial services market in Europe and strengthen the spirit of enterprise , research , education and the integration of the European networks .
But how can we integrate the European networks when , as the President of the Commission pointed out , we only spend EUR 20 billion a year and it will take twenty years to complete the programme ?
All these worthy objectives are included in the Lisbon strategy ; however , we have to admit that we are in the third year and , in certain sectors such as education , for example , things are not going quite according to plan .
Those who supported the Lisbon strategy for regenerating the European economy were right about one thing .
Their programme , with the resources which needed to be mobilised , was a programme with a long-term return .
However , we need measures which have an immediate return in the present climate , with the threat of recession hanging over the global economy , so that we can find new impetus which will allow the Lisbon strategy to proceed to its conclusion .
In order for this to happen , we need to shake off the fatal spirit of defeatism besieging us at present and regain the spirit of determination of Lisbon , even if the present , disastrous circumstances for the Union can be summed up in the words of Kipling : ' If you can bear to see your life 's work broken and stoop again , build it again with worn-out tools ' .
That is precisely where we stand at the moment .
That is where our duty lies .
If we fight for this , the day will dawn when truth will also prevail for us in Europe .
I wonder when it will be our turn , when B52s or lethal cyber war weapons will attack our buildings , or maybe those in France , perhaps with the support of Great Britain and others .
A paradox ?
No .
We can expect even this from the fundamentalist culture of Bush 's council .
I have seen an Iraqi baby 's lacerated head , lacerated by the weapons of those who call themselves liberators .
Those bodies and images are no different from those of the Kurdish baby girl poisoned by Saddam 's chemical weapons , the little Palestinian boy slaughtered by the Israeli army , the little Israeli girl killed by a suicide bomber or the bodies of the Twin Towers victims .
With this war , the masks have come off .
The USA is not complying with international law : consider Kyoto , the International Criminal Court , the death penalty , star wars , the use of weapons of mass destruction .
United States militarism is a danger to the international community ; a policy of domination and death is a danse macabre between terrorism and this policy .
However , it is also from the United States , from its people , that hope and an alternative are emerging : huge groups are saying ' no ' to the war , ' no ' to terrorism , ' no ' to revenge , as they are all over the world .
What can and should we do ?
How can we make the countries waging this war of aggression comply with the agreement ratified in the United Nations after the Second World War ?
Europe cannot simply say : we will take care of the reconstruction .
Our efforts should be channelled into stopping an unlawful war .
The present , Mr Simitis , is the past and also the future .
This is why we must prevent Iraqi , British and American citizens dying .
We say that the UN should be the organisation to act : and so let us convene the Security Council and the United Nations Assembly .
Europe must be united , of course , but it must be united in saying ' no ' and in ending this war .
Rabiya , a young Iraqi girl , told me with great intensity : ' You are killing our dreams too ; you are killing our dream that we can free ourselves from Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship ' .
( Applause from the left )
Mr President , I welcome the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission .
The war against Iraq is completely without justification and must therefore be condemned .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that is something on which the Council remains silent .
In the war against Iraq , cluster bombs and landmines are to be used , in contravention of international law .
The Council remains silent about that , Mr President .
The war is being waged against the civilian population , millions of innocent people becoming immediate or secondary victims , the latter as a result of the collapse of food and water supplies .
Anyone who has been in Iraq will know what the situation there is like .
The war is unleashing a humanitarian catastrophe , but the Council has nothing to say about that either , and so , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I call upon you to be silent no longer .
I urge you to support the initiative by Russia and the Arab League for an emergency session of the Security Council , to gather together those Member States of the European Union that have opposed the war , and to set in motion action that will rescue the United Nations from its role of spectator and again give it a part to play in this conflict .
Be silent no longer , Mr President-in-Office of the Council !
Just as we do , you represent the majority of Europe 's citizens , and you can be sure of their support .
I urge you to take responsibility and stop this war .
That Saddam Hussein 's regime is a threat to world peace cannot be disputed , given the facts .
Since its defeat in the first Gulf War , Iraq has been the object of many resolutions , with which it has generally not complied .
This has never , however , resulted in their being enforced under the auspices of the UN .
For a long time there were even attempts to have the sanctions against Iraq lifted .
There was also barely any international reaction at all when the inspections were cut short on account of Iraq 's failure to cooperate .
Yet Saddam Hussein 's obsession with the production of weapons of mass destruction was well-known .
Since then , his people have been oppressed and refugees have been and still are coming to our EU Member States .
Iraq remained a festering sore .
There is no sign of peace there .
Because of the secret service , however , there is apparently great stability , which cannot , unfortunately , be attacked from within - I see no sign of it being so .
Our patience with this can run out too quickly , indeed , but patience can also degenerate into indifference .
For many years this was apparent in our attitude towards the dramatic events in Yugoslavia .
Who is not still embarrassed by that ?
We now know that anyone who wants to establish justice must in extreme cases accept the support of force , including military force .
Is there , however , sufficient formal basis under international law for the coalition 's military presence ?
I quote Max van der Stoel , a well-known Socialist ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs , High Commissioner for minorities at the OECD , a well-known , important Socialist spokesman .
Yesterday he said the following in the NRC-Handelsblad : ' Yes , this basis is not convincing , but I do not doubt the coalition 's moral justification of this action for a moment , I do not doubt it for a moment . '
I find that a good left-wing stance .
The debate at the time was about whether intervention should take place immediately , after one or two weeks or after six weeks .
This debate is not sufficient to drum a clear message into the minds of those who risk their lives in the field .
There is little point in their looking back .
The question is whether we should now wish the coalition forces a swift victory so as to avoid long-drawn-out misery both for the public and for themselves .
My group would like to make it clear that when push comes to shove , they all really support the armies , in the same way as they support the people who need to be liberated as quickly as possible .
I cannot imagine that any of us would not support the armies now .
We are not very quick to demonstrate on this side of the Chamber , but I was surprised to see large pieces of paper with the word ' Peace ' written on them hung up on the other side , while no one ever stopped to wonder what discontent there was in Iraq , and I do not remember seeing any demonstrations against that , not even in this Chamber .
I think that it is important that justice takes its course for Saddam Hussein .
It is a matter of regret that the UN Security Council has forfeited authority .
Vetoes are being used in a dishonest way , and votes are up for sale .
The UN per se and its services will be more important than ever in post-war Iraq .
We must realise that this matter is a serious warning to the EU , which is obviously still not capable of or willing to defend European principles and values wherever it is necessary to do so .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I vigorously contest what Mr Oostlander has said .
I did not think much of the placards behind me either , but - particularly as their group has fewer placards on display - he should have a word with his colleague Mr Helmer , who held up a placard bearing the word ' Blitzkrieg ' .
Now , anyone can use placards to express his intellectual stance , and Mr Helmer has done so today , seeming to be the intellectual heir of the people who once held such placards aloft .
Mr Oostlander , if you quote Max van der Stoel and say that the basis may not be convincing , but that , in moral terms , the action is justified , you can also try putting it the other way round and saying that an action is justified only if it is taken on a truly convincing basis .
If there is even a whisper of doubt , you are assuming responsibility for endangering human lives .
War must always be the last resort of politics , but it cannot be the last resort as long as the policy is a matter of doubt .
If ever there were an avoidable war , this one is it .
A few days ago , ladies and gentlemen , we were presented with the option of coming to a decision on the basis of reports from two respectable diplomats , Mr Blix and Mr ElBaradei .

They said , or rather Mr ElBaradei said , that there were no nuclear weapons , and that they had found none , and Mr Blix said that his mission had been successful and that we could , given a couple more months , disarm Iraq peacefully .

The two gentlemen who made these proposals were not radical socialists , nor were they anti-American agitators ; on the contrary , they are thoroughly respectable diplomats from the United Nations , and were showing us a peaceful way ahead , for which there was a majority in the Security Council .
There was , though , also a minority , to which the Pope could have given his apostolic blessing , had they nonetheless voted for this war because they had forged a coalition - not of the willing , but of the wilful - which wanted this war to happen come what may .
I am not impugning the many Members here in this House who believe , on the basis of profound inner conviction , that this tinpot dictator can be got rid of only by the use of armed force .
That is one way of looking at things , but not in the least does it alter the fact that these two gentlemen I have quoted showed us a peaceful way forward , and I have heard all those in this House - including those in your group , Mr Poettering - who have said that this was the right way to go .
If this was the right way to go , why do you not summon up the courage to say that the war is the wrong way ?
That , after all , would be the logical conclusion to come to .
Let me say again that those who defy all reason by going down this road also bear the responsibility for the bloody consequences along the way - consequences about which we will all be talking for a long time yet , because we will all be suffering from them .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for your speeches .
I would also like to thank everyone who mentioned the Greek Presidency .
I shall try and reply briefly to two or three questions .
Many of you appealed directly to the Greek Presidency to take the initiative and state a specific opinion or take specific recourse to the United Nations .
But what is the presidency 's role ?
The role of the presidency , not just the Greek Presidency , but any presidency , is not to decide what the European Union 's position is .
It is not to welcome one opinion and condemn another .
It is not to express its own views , because Greece too has its own views but it cannot express its views as the views of the Union .
The role of the presidency is to try and marry differing opinions and to follow the rules in order to bring about a result in the form of a unanimous or majority opinion .
If it cannot manage to do that , then it has no place .
The role of the presidency therefore , and I should like to emphasise this , is to defend an important virtue , the virtue of cooperation , the virtue of joint endeavour and joint action .
That is the first thing it has to do .
And that is what the Presidency is working at , because otherwise it will end up with precisely the opposite of what it is supposed to achieve : division .
And we do not want division , especially in these difficult times .
My second point is that a number of honourable Members referred to the Union 's foreign policy , again saying that it is non-existent and that nothing has been done .
We heard the President of the Commission say that a European Union peacekeeping force will most probably take over the role of the NATO force in Skopje this week .
This is unprecedented and is the outcome of serious effort in the foreign policy sector .
Anyone listening to the heads of the Balkan countries over the last fortnight , following the assassination of the Serbian prime minister , will have realised that the Western Balkans have high hopes of the European Union .
Why ?
Because the European Union has applied a foreign policy .
There are several other examples of the really creative presence of the European Union I could mention .
Are there only a few ?
Yes ! There are only a few .
And we failed to unite our position on the basic , moral issue of war or peace .
We have failed to do so on numerous other issues .
But we do not write off what we have done and nor does this mean we must write off what has happened and stop making an effort when it comes to our common foreign policy .
We have to make that effort .
I agree - and this is my third point , because I have heard numerous opinions which are just not realistic - with what Mr Cohn-Bendit said , that compromises are needed .
Compromises are also needed because you will be debating the problem of Iraq tomorrow .
There are a number of issues where I believe , if you pass a resolution , the Presidency and the Commission and the European Union will be able to move forward , such as the need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Iraq , including - as one member said - on the Turkish border , the need to deal with serious humanitarian problems by mobilising the aid provided for and the central role of the United Nations in the political , economic and social reconstruction of Iraq .
If we say it here loud and clear , we shall create frameworks , we shall create commitments .
And , of course , we must not forget the peace process in the Middle East and the importance of transatlantic relations .
The Union 's foreign policy , like every other policy , is created .
This endeavour has its triumphs and setbacks , but the policy is still created .
And it is up to us .
If we simply say that the Union is out of its depth and we throw in the towel , then we do not want a Union .
But we do want a Union !
And we want a strong Union .
That is what we are striving for and that is what we must strive for .
Finally , I should like to refer to a number of comments made on economic policy .
First of all , this is a long Presidency text because it is now standard practice in the Union for each spring Council to reiterate all the previous resolutions for the record .
The second point is that there are numerous questions , references and issues which refer back to committees , but if you read the text and the texts it refers to , such as the resolutions of the ? cofin Council , you will see that many of the issues raised are answered .
The Stability Pact , for example , was examined by the Ministers for Finance , who said that it must be maintained , that this is neither the time nor the place for flexibility and that there is a risk of inflation .
I leave it to you to decide whether or not they were right . It was examined .
That is clear from the text .
It is also clear from the text that war can upset the best-laid plans .
It is important to remain level-headed .
It is important not to panic , not to believe that we need to take measures here and now or here , there and everywhere .
We need to keep moving steadily forward on the course we have set .
I believe , ladies and gentlemen , that this is one of the main messages of the efforts made in Brussels ; that despite the adversities , despite the difficulties , we have a great deal in common , a great deal in common , which we cannot put to one side , which is why , especially in these difficult times , we need to try and express what we have in common and move forward together .
Mr President , the resolution Parliament is now on the way towards adopting is backward-looking . Instead , we should have turned our attention to the future .
In my view , it is incomprehensible that , in recent days , so many people have expended so much effort on working out how to deplore the decision taken by the American and British governments concerning military action in Iraq , an action to which my country subscribes .
If we did in fact have to be backward-looking , we could have made better use of our time and energy in working out how to condemn the Iraqi regime , which for 12 years has ignored every UN resolution .
It is not the coalition that is responsible for the war in Iraq ; it is Saddam Hussein and his regime .
I must therefore vote against conclusion number 3 , and I am unable to deplore or regret the decision taken by the coalition . It was Saddam Hussein who forced them to take it .
By an unfortunate turn of events , Saddam Hussein has succeeded in dividing our world , and we must hope that the day will soon come when he can be brought before an international court and tried for his crimes against humanity .
Now , we must look forward , as in part does the resolution , I am pleased to say .
Now , it is a question of preventing as much suffering as possible in the wake of the war .
The Iraqi people have suffered enough . We must therefore be ready to come to their aid , and as soon as possible .
We must take joint responsibility for peace and freedom in Iraq . We must help the Iraqi people to a dignified life in a democratic society , a community founded on the rule of law in which human rights are observed and minorities respected .
That is the most important aspect of the resolution we are to vote on .
Mr President , a new resolution on Iraq cannot be more conciliatory than the resolution we adopted by a large majority a few weeks ago .
That resolution was and still is in keeping both with the real problems in the world and the feelings and reactions of the citizens in our countries who , in their reactions to this illegal , immoral , pre-emptive and therefore subjugating war , expressed themselves as European citizens , and formulated the only serious and reliable basis on which we can continue to build Europe .
Many of us here are concerned about the future of the world and of Europe .
However , there are others here whose sole concern is to justify their governments , to sanction after the event decisions which will cause the modern world system and the international community - surely a misnomer now - to disappear .
The Te Deum for the demise of the UN offered up in all sincerity by Mr Pearl doubtless also applied to the marginalisation of the European Union , both old and new , whatever some of the candidate countries may think .
This humiliation will continue if we somehow sanction the invasion of Iraq after the event .
There is no doubt as to who will gain the upper hand militarily and technologically : the invaders .
But why should we turn their technical supremacy into political victory by feeling compelled to condone the war once it is over ?
The only thing we have a historical duty to do is to prepare our contribution to a more balance world , insofar as this is still possible ; to make a quantum leap , as quickly as possible , on the road towards political unification , especially in the field of foreign policy and defence .
Those of us who have no intention of letting Europe and the world change into a sort of Jurassic Park must move forward .
Those here who are willing to achieve more must unravel the contradictions into which their selfish , divisive choices are forcing them on their own .
A great British playwright , Harold Pinter said - and some members would do well to remember this - that unless Europe finds the solidarity , intelligence , courage and will to challenge and resist US power Europe itself will deserve Alexander Herzen 's definition : ' We are not the doctors . We are the disease ' .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our resolutions become no more convincing the more self-righteously we belabour one another with judgments about what is wrong and what right .
We should be helping to find ways out of the crisis .
Firstly , the war must be brought to an end as speedily as possible , with the minimum possible damage being done to people , and Saddam Hussein and his criminal regime being disarmed .
Secondly , the Iraqi people must then have the opportunity to take their own decisions , and the United Nations - rather than one of the belligerent parties - must assume responsibility for the reconstruction of the country .
To this reconstruction , thirdly , the European Union must make a determined contribution , it being in its own primary interest that peaceful development should take root both in Iraq and throughout the Middle East .
We are currently finding out how much we are affected when the opposite happens .
Fourthly , we must reinvigorate the transatlantic partnership and rebuild a relationship of trust with the United States of America , which will , for the foreseeable future , remain the only power capable of guaranteeing order and security on a global and regional scale .
All credit for that to the Americans , to whom we Germans owe a great deal , for they stood up for our freedom at a time when that freedom was menaced by Soviet Communism .
Then their soldiers had the responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of our capital , Berlin .
It is for those reasons that I am in solidarity with the United States , even though this solidarity has a critical edge to it from time to time .
Solidarity of this sort is not to be abandoned out of hand when there are differences of opinion , for we see no alternatives to the Atlantic Alliance , any more than there are alternatives to European unification .
Mr President , I would like us to cast our minds back to September 11 2001 . After those events we all agreed that the world had changed .
We appreciated that global terrorism , a terrorism well-financed and organised with no clear political objective beyond creating chaos , required a new approach to security .
It was clear that we can no longer take a passive approach .
We can no longer sit on the sidelines tut-tutting when faced with dangerous , repressive regimes prepared to murder their own people , threaten regional security and nurture terrorism .
We saw that we needed a pro-active approach , we needed to develop a concept of global justice for all people and to build a worldwide security system based on active involvement .
We followed through on that in relation to Afghanistan , but now when faced with a difficult and dangerous crisis , we seem to have retreated into a comfort zone of our old certainties .
We have particularly retreated to the cold war attitude towards the United States .
We feel that the transatlantic relationship is some sort of zero-sum game .
For one side to win , the other side has to lose .
If we continue that process the world will become much more secure because every issue and every crisis will be divisive as we try to gather around separate poles .
We need transatlantic partnership for the benefit of world security .
We must ensure that we get global certainties and agreements for the future and not re-fight old battles .
It may well be that the structures we set up after the second world war are not suitable for dealing with the post-September 11 world .
In that case we should be working to the future , thinking about how we rebuild Iraq with United Nations support and how we secure peace in Iraq whilst respecting the rights of Iraqi people to their own future .
As I speak , many thousands of my own countrymen and women are putting their lives at risk to free a people from tyranny .
Many people do not agree with that war and I respect their views but I ask that this Chamber respects the position of the men and women whose lives are at risk .
I am frankly amazed that , amongst all this talk of legality , I have not heard one word about Iraqi treatment of prisoners of war , which is contrary to the Geneva Convention .
I have not heard one word of condemnation of Iraqi troops killing their own people in Basra .
Imagine what British troops feel like seeing that happen and being powerless to stop it .
Mr President , naturally I too regret that the United Nations have not found a solution to the conflict in Iraq .
I also think , however , that we must all acknowledge that this stage in the discussion is now finished and that we in Parliament must stop shadow-boxing with the past .
After all , we all agree that Saddam Hussein has been categorically opposing the United Nations for the past 12 years .
Throughout his rule he has oppressed his people and violated international law in many areas .
That is why the members of the Security Council accepted Resolution 1441 , and they must therefore now bear the consequences .
Anyone who does not do so is , despite protests to the contrary and perhaps also unintentionally , implicitly helping to keep Saddam in power .
Explain that to the inhabitants of Basra , who are being fired at by their own Iraqi army .
This does not help international law and the Iraqi people in the slightest .
The crisis once more makes it painfully clear that we need a European foreign and security policy and ultimately a European defence force so that we can play a role in the next crisis .
It is no use lecturing other people about international values if you are not able to enforce international law yourself .
I felt that the European summit was not able to avoid deadlock on its other subject , the Lisbon process .
Of course , this will get us nowhere when it comes to economic liberalisation .
Good intentions are all very well , but I would like to see the Commission set up a strict schedule for the implementation of the measures so that the Member States can be reminded of their responsibilities .
To conclude , therefore , I warmly welcome Commissioner Monti 's initiative in investigating the banned state support for the French energy group Electricit√© de France .
It is absolutely essential that we complete the internal market in order to be able to continue to compete with the USA and Japan .
Mr President , I must admit that it feels slightly surreal wanting to talk about other aspects of the Summit apart from Iraq , particularly given that some of the other things that the Summit dealt with are not exactly going to help us towards a more equal or a more peaceful world .
I want to pick up on certain aspects where , for once - unlike last year 's Spring Summit- we looked at issues relating to global equity to some extent .
For example , Paragraph 60 onwards of the Presidency Conclusions mentioned promoting sustainable development on a global scale .
Those Conclusions talked about enhancement of corporate social and environmental responsibility , both at EU level and internationally .
I would hope that it would apply to such issues as the granting of contracts on a fair and open basis - rather than giving them to your rich friends .
The Conclusions also mention the means of promoting sustainable and fair trade .
I wonder if we have actually proofed some of the other policies that we came up with at this Spring Summit against those ambitions or , indeed , ambitions to encourage export credits that are consistent with sustainable development when certain Member States pay out over 50 % of their export credits to enable arms deals to go ahead .
I hope that , in the aftermath of this Spring Summit , we are going to pay attention to the policies that we talked about there .
I hope that we are going to carry those forward seriously , because we need to examine this ideal of becoming the world 's most internationally competitive continent in the light of asking ourselves what the implications are for the global losers if we are the global winners , and what this is going to do to enhance stability , equality and justice in the world .
Mr President , I should like to appeal for calm and tolerance in the House .
After all , these are the cornerstones of European integration .
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats attempted to table a resolution on the basis of the Council 's declaration .
Unfortunately at this stage consensus appears impossible .
Some of the approaches put forward seem to aim in practice at calling for the European Union to become part of the movement of non-aligned countries .
My group argues on the contrary for strengthening the transatlantic axis as a strategic priority for the European Union .
We agree with the Council on this .
It is therefore somewhat surprising to hear the Commission praise an initiative for common defence beyond the territory of the Union .
It might be termed an extra-Community venture .
No eyebrows should be raised if others now table further proposals .
The Council devoted a good deal of time to discussion of the eagerly awaited post-war period .
It sent out an unequivocal call for European Union involvement in rebuilding Iraq .
I congratulate it on that .
I would however point out that at present what is required of us is humanitarian aid for those most in need .
I would have welcomed more specific details of action taken by the Commission in that regard .
I trust this objective will unite us all , and that we will be prepared to regroup under the European flag as we strive towards it .
A further issue that brooks no delay is ending the conflict in the Middle East .
I would have welcomed the Commission 's comments on this too .
Mr President , nobody in his or her right mind welcomes this war or any other .
We cannot however fail to deal with international terrorism or threats to our security .
We cannot either fail to deal with the state of complete bondage the people of Iraq have had to endure up to the present .
Mr President , if EU leaders were actually to deliver the goals set last week of the central role of the UN , an EU capacity in foreign and defence policy and strengthening the transatlantic partnership , most of the public would cheer .
Our leaders are letting us down .
One of the few silver linings of this illegitimate war is that even in the UK more people realise how crucial it is to have a single European voice .
Chirac should realise that making the EU a rival of the US is a no-brainer .
Blair needs to understand that the route to partnership with Washington is via Brussels .
On Iraq , what was missing from the Summit conclusions was a reference to preserving the devolved administration of the Kurds in the north .
The Kurds have been betrayed so often , but this time we must guarantee their freedom and identity .
They must enjoy self-government within a federal democratic Iraq .
I absolutely agree that Iraq must observe the Geneva Conventions on prisoners of war , but how hypocritical it is for Rumsfeld to insist on this while denying such protection to those prisoners illegally detained in Guantanamo Bay .
Mr President , divisions have emerged within the Council over the choices made this week but , if we care about having a Europe which is politically influential , we have to look to the future and work for the Europe of the future .
Europe has to have a single foreign policy and a single defence policy , to take a leading role on the international stage and to be able to guarantee peace outside its borders .
We will have to achieve this objective during the second half of this year and , in this connection , I must reply to the disagreeable words spoken by Mr Watson , who clearly knows little about and has difficulty recognising what it means to be pro-European .
Clearly , as far as he is concerned , being pro-European means always saying yes , but if we sometimes say no , we might build a better Europe .
It would be an extremely grave political error not to heal the present divisions .
The Italian Government 's statements which move in this direction certainly give us hope , and I believe President Prodi will be in agreement with the Italian Prime Minister when he meets with him in Rome on Friday .
The strong , influential political Europe of the future cannot , however , be created with an anti-American stance .
It is appropriate to point this out in this Chamber for there are still those in Europe who place the greatest western democracy and Saddam Hussein 's despotic , criminal regime on the same level .
The killer 's name is Saddam Hussein ; we cannot and must not adhere to the slogan : ' Neither Bush nor Saddam ' .
When Europe has rediscovered the reasons for its strong unity , it will have to participate directly , under the aegis of the United Nations , in the construction of the new Iraqi democracy , once it has assisted with the humanitarian needs , the result of a conflict which Saddam Hussein could have avoided by accepting his proposed exile , mentioned several times by Mr Pannella .
It must be a Europe which has relations with the moderate Arab countries , which strives for the security of Israel and for the construction of a new Palestinian state : in short , a Europe which guarantees peace in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East .
Mr President , on 17 February , the European Council declared that the United Nations must remain at the centre of the international order and that it wished to attain the objective of disarming Saddam Hussein peacefully , saying that this is what the European people want ; it declared that its support for the United Nations inspectors although saying that it did not want the inspections to continue indefinitely , and , in fact , the inspectors had put forward a plan for disarmament which also had a time limit .
Today we are here in Parliament , not least on behalf of those European people , of that public opinion referred to by the Council , to hold to account first of all those European governments which have supported , are assisting and are participating in a unilateral war which we condemn unreservedly .
We are on day seven , and the dramatic events tell us that it will not be a blitzkrieg .
Nevertheless , our anti-war position does not mean siding with that regime , which must account for its crimes before international courts , and it does not mean being indifferent to the dangerous path being opened up by the violation of international law and the many other violations , such as the use of prohibited weapons , the suffering inflicted on the Iraqi people , the treatment of prisoners and the fate of the Kurdish people .
Then there is the Middle East .
Certain interventionist quarters have said that this war will resolve the Middle East question .
We do not think this is the case .
We can see that things are getting increasingly worse : on the one hand , this war is helping the extremist , group Hamas , and , on the other , the Israeli army is continuing its actions .
Lastly , I would like to ask the European governments : what are you gaining from this terrible experience ?
I would like to say to the Member States : incorporate , introduce federalist elements into your European foreign policy .
If you do not do so , we will not have a common policy .
Can you not see that , even without powers , the Commission is currently a point of reference while the role of the High Representative has been destroyed because of your differences ?
Once again - it has already happened in the Balkans - we are powerless and at a highly critical time .
Remember that the sum total of 15 or 25 national policies which satisfy longstanding interests , will never constitute a European foreign policy .
Mr President , Thomas Friedmann , an American , gave it as his opinion that ' this war is not a war of necessity , but one that is clearly deliberate ' .
In ' Le Monde ' , Alain Pellet took the view that ' aggression is still aggression , even if it is on the part of a great democratic empire and directed against a bloody tyranny ' .
This is especially the case when such aggression begins at the very point when the Security Council and the inspectors are succeeding in keeping Saddam Hussein 's regime in check and are beginning to disarm it .
I am particularly struck by the fact that a section of Europe 's governments is the cause of many deaths and injuries , and , indeed , of massive destruction in an already poverty-stricken country , or at least regards such things as acceptable , for private wars such as this can also be uncommonly contagious .
I am reassured , though , by the fact that Europe 's people condemn this war and have no wish to dance blindly and uncritically to the US administration 's tune .
Europe 's citizens give us cause for hope , and their love of peace should be the foundation on which we construct a common foreign and security policy .
The USA 's status as a military hyperpower means , however , that it will not work without a military component .
We simply have to be prepared to consult among ourselves on where we should concentrate our military expenditure .
The next test of our mettle , though , is almost upon us .
With firms close to the US administration - such as a subsidiary of Halliburton - being awarded government contracts worth billions , and , according to newspaper reports , British firms also queuing up in America to get their slice of the cake , Europe is organising humanitarian aid , but it must not stop at that .
We have to use a Security Council mandate as a means of gaining for ourselves a substantial role in the reconstruction of Iraq , of an Iraq in which all - Sunni , Shia , and Kurd - can live in freedom and peace , free from dictatorship whether at home or abroad .
Taking it for granted as I do that nobody will have anything like the decisiveness required to implement the UN 's resolutions on Palestine and Israel , it will again be Europe that has to take action for a just solution in the Middle East .
I nevertheless hope that Great Britain and a number of other supporters of this American war will spare a thought for Europe and slowly come to realise that , in the coalition of the willing , the only will that counts is that of the USA .
I do not believe that Europe exists to pick up the pieces left behind by others ; on the contrary , we need our own identity and our own common foreign and security policy !
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I do not believe that the war currently raging in Iraq is the USA 's private war .
It has too many repercussions for that , not only on the surrounding region , but also on Europe .
This also means that it is otiose to wonder whether it might perhaps have been possible to prevent it .
Saddam Hussein himself could certainly have prevented it , if he had kept to at least one of the seventeen resolutions passed by the UN Security Council .
It would also have been one of his primary duties to give his people , whom he had decimated with weapons of mass destruction , the chance of a decent existence as human beings by ensuring that the sanctions imposed on his country could be lifted .
We can but hope and try to do whatever we can to prevent these innocent people from having to pay a high price for this regime and for the war it has caused .
I can also understand why many people take to the streets in a kind of impotent rage , believing as they do that warfare cannot , in the twenty-first century , be a legitimate political tool .
I can also sympathise with the Catholic Church and the Pope , whose attempts right up to the last moment to prevent armed conflict were , in the final analysis , motivated by concern for the Christian minority in Iraq , and were , alas , rewarded by no more success .
Diplomacy stood not the least chance of success , and all the peacekeeping institutions that arose out of the aftermath of the Second World War - the UN , NATO , the European Union - have sustained damage .
For us Europeans , there is just one question left to be answered , and that is whether we still have the desire to influence the course of world history or whether we want to opt out .
If we are to stay in , the first thing that will be needed is a reshaping of the trans-Atlantic relationship , and the second will be a definition of the fields of action in which the European Union has to assume responsibility in the context of security policy .
This should also determine what resources are allocated to enable such a policy to be actually implemented .
Any policy must in any case be founded upon the common interests of all , and must enable Europe to be one of the poles in a multipolar world .
Mr President , I am of course not speaking on behalf of my colleague Mr Sakellariou , but , as he is unable to speak at the moment , it is my turn !
Let me get to the point and say that I am thinking of Afghanistan .
There , we all joined together in doing our bit in a just cause ; we were all glad of the degree of success we achieved in combating terrorism in that country , and there was agreement among ourselves that the people of this earth , be they Muslim or Christian , should not have to be at war with each other .
It was precisely for this reason that we succeeded in Afghanistan , for we were able to make it clear to Muslims that it was side by side with Muslims that terrorists had to be fought .
The situation in Iraq , though , is quite different .
There , we have not yet succeeded in persuading Muslims that a war there is as necessary as it was in Afghanistan , and their scepticism is something I share .
While there really are not yet sufficient reasons for it , this war is - unfortunately - a reality .
My fear is that , this being so , we will , once this war is over , have to deal with the problem of huge differences of outlook between Muslims and Christians .
It is probable that , after the war , much of the work we have been doing for decades will have to be done again .
Where some things are concerned , we will have to begin again from the ground up in order to convince Muslims that Christians do not actually have anything against them .
Unfortunately , though , it will not be possible to get that point across to the Muslims in Iraq .
Mr President , I deplore the war and I deplore the fact that it started without a UN mandate and without having exhausted all the ways of achieving a peaceful solution .
I also , however , deplore the challenging behaviour of Saddam Hussein who has continually managed to ignore the UN resolutions .
Most of all I feel sorry for the victims and regret the human suffering that is without doubt much greater than we can imagine .
Regretting and hoping that the war will soon be over is not all that there remains for us to do , however .
We still have our responsibility for the future .
We must try to alleviate the suffering by immediately making every effort to provide humanitarian aid .
We must strengthen our relationships with Arab countries and give the Mediterranean dialogue a real chance to succeed .
We must invest as much as possible in a definitive peace process in the Middle East .
We must also not forget about repairing transatlantic relationships , whilst enforcing respect for our autonomy .
I hope to find this all in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow .
Last but not least , however , we must do all we can to eliminate the divisions in the European Union .
Our Member States must use the old , tried-and-trusted European formula and talk to each other , even on matters relating to foreign affairs and security policy .
It is high time all the Member States together took another look at the common foreign and security policy and the defence policy , and the best place for that is the European Convention .
There is a working party there that is actively working on foreign policy , and there is also a working party there that is actively working on defence policy .
The people in the Convention are motivated to talk to each other and to everyone ; they are not divided into groups according to the fault lines that the Iraq crisis has exposed .
Let us encourage the Convention to reorganise its powers and its structure in such a way that the political will to cooperate is at least given a chance and encouraged to develop where it is lacking , and let us force the heads of government to sit down together , particularly when things get difficult .
Mr President , I am glad that Commissioner Prodi pointed out the disparity between the financial costs of this war and those available to meet the needs of humanity .
There is something surrealistic - and in fact disgusting - about squandering money on a fully-contrived war and then handing out lucrative contracts to favourite local firms to repair the damage caused by that very war .
( Applause from the left )
I will , however , move on now to the economic part of the Spring Summit , focusing upon two aspects : progress in innovation and enterprise , and environmental protection .
Every Spring Summit seems to me like a non-stop re-run of the Delors White Paper .
That is also somewhat surrealistic .
As far as research and development is concerned , let me be positive .
I am glad that Commissioner Prodi is going to look at the EIB because , frankly , that institution is inefficient and ineffective in aiding those firms which could be innovative and competitive if they just had that helping hand .
Good for him .
As far as environmental protection is concerned , let me highlight intelligent energy , for which I am the rapporteur in this Parliament .
This is a programme that was presented many months late by the Commission - it should have started in January this year .
That is not efficient , and it is most certainly not competitive and dynamic √† la Lisbon Declaration .
This programme , I am sad to say , has been cut by the Council .
As rapporteur , I am currently weighing up whether to accept a reduced programme which will actually happen or whether to argue for what should happen .
Let us be clear that we are not matching our words with deeds .
Mr President , we all agree in acknowledging that , if Europe does not speak with one voice , it is a powerless Europe , but also in this debate , it seems that it is hard for the European Parliament to have one single voice .
If we do not want the war to halt the path towards the Constitutional Treaty and towards joint foreign and defence policies , we have to prevent the rift which has divided Europe in recent weeks deepening .
We were in agreement in condemning Saddam 's regime ; however , we had different opinions on pre-emptive , unilateral war , since mainly innocent victims pay the price for war and since the post-war situation is still completely unclear .
But what is the realistic thing to do now ?
We have to avoid making it more difficult for dialogue between old allies who feel the weight of their responsibility for the world 's future .
We must participate in providing humanitarian aid , granting the United Nations the central role of the mandate also in the subsequent stage , in reconstructing Iraq .
We must heal the rift between Europeans starting with what unites us .
This is the challenge which the Spring European Council tried to keep sight of and this is why President Prodi also reminded us of the burden of war on Europe 's economic revival .
This is the challenge that Parliament too must address .
We must take steps towards peace - starting with peace in the Middle East - and towards the political unity of Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Item E of the Council Conclusions states that the European Union is committed to keeping its leading role in sustainable development , both at home and abroad .
It is therefore perfectly clear to me that what is currently going on in Iraq is in contravention of Item E of the Council Conclusions .
For the war in Iraq is not sustainable ; it is bringing suffering and devastation upon the people and is weakening across the board the industrialised countries ' position in the global context of sustainable development .
Money is being wasted on it rather than being put into sustainable investment .
In the United States , it has been estimated that the war will cost USD 90 billion in the best-case scenario , and USD 1 000 billion at worst .
We have already gone beyond the best-case scenario , as the war has already gone on longer than the USD 90 billion estimate assumed .
That far exceeds the mere USD 50 billion that all the industrial nations together spend in a year on development cooperation .
In view of this , we can indeed say that money is being wasted rather than being spent in a sustainable way .
Secondly , I get the feeling that sustainable development is being relegated to the bottom of the list even within the European Union .
On the credit side , I acknowledge that reference is made to the promotion of environmental technology and of clean transport , but I do believe that we have to generally press forward with more vigorous ecological renewal of our industrialised society if employment is to be generated and sustainable development advanced , as , without it , both these objectives will remain beyond our reach .
So clear benchmarks are needed for what we want and for the methods that will enable us to monitor it ; sustainable development needs clear goals and clear indicators in the same way as employment policy does , for sustainability is not a fig leaf , but a modern garment that would suit the EU well .
Mr President , every spring I have been critical of the fact that we are moving further and further away from the Lisbon objectives , rather than getting closer to them .
My criticisms are directed not so much at the Council - least of all the country that holds the Presidency , Greece - or the Commission .
The main focus of my criticism must be the nation states : the keys to Europe 's development are in their hands .
I am quoting a greater voice than my own : The European Round Table of Industrialists , expressing its concern and furthermore issuing a word of warning :
I would like to discuss three things .
Firstly , I noticed that the emphasis at this summit was on industrial policy and entrepreneurship , which I believe to be justified in today 's adverse political and economic conditions .
We must place the emphasis on the real economy .
I believe , however , that this should also filter through to other files that were mentioned in the summit conclusions .
This is called ' coherence of policy ' .
I would in particular like to mention the takeover directive , the new merger regime and public procurement procedures .
It would also be appropriate to place greater emphasis on the effects these have on the economy .
I would like to invite the Council and the Commission to tell us how they assess these effects .
Secondly , the Council has decided to set up a European employment task force , and in the debate in the plenary session held in preparation for this summit this plan , which was the bright idea of Blair , Chirac and Schroeder , took me by surprise because these self-same governments are making impending concrete policy plans more difficult .
I was referring to the temporary employment directive on which the Council of Ministers has still not taken a common position , even though the directive is a key example of the kind of flexibility and security we must have in the labour market .
It is particularly disappointing that it is taking so long for the position to be taken .
I myself was very surprised that the Council 's conclusions are now mentioning December 2003 , whereas on 6 March the Council of Ministers was talking about efforts to arrive at a common position by the June session .
I would therefore like clarification on this point .
As far as the task force is concerned , new ideas are always welcome , but it is actions that are most important .
The third point concerns pensions .
The summit brought to a conclusion the first open coordination cycle on pensions .
It is a good thing that a second cycle has been agreed and that the accession countries will also be specifically involved in this one .
I am assuming - and I would also appreciate confirmation of this - that the interim evaluation that was scheduled for 2004 is still in the planning stage , and I would in particular like to see the Commission and the Council put forward concrete proposals to solve the labour mobility problems and fiscal problems surrounding pensions .
Mr President , I do not know whether to comment on the hysterical remarks by some Members of the House , or simply to ignore them .
There have been calls for some Western leaders to be brought before the International Criminal Court .
Such statements are sectarian , irresponsible and deny themselves all legitimacy inasmuch as they fail to call for the same treatment to be meted out to Saddam Hussein although he alone is responsible for this crisis .
No single political group or Member of this House has a monopoly over the cause of peace .
I can understand that this cause generates strong emotions .
There are two possible responses to the impotence demonstrated by the European Union .
One such response involves behaving in an insulting and dismissive manner , casting blame on each other and perverting the noble cause of peace for particular national interests .
A Member of this House did so referring to the situation in the Basque country .
He failed to ascribe any responsibility for that situation to those who attack freedoms in the area on a daily basis or to those who have been in government there for over 20 years .
The alternative response involves the responsible approach adopted by the Greek Presidency , making a virtue out of a necessity .
The Presidency endeavoured to learn the lessons of this crisis and take a long hard look at the future .
The European Union has actually become an economic power .
It is now a commercial , financial and industrial power .
Unfortunately , however , it does not make its weight felt as it should in the international context .
Consequently there is currently no alternative to the transatlantic axis , Mr President , at least regarding security and defence .
This is probably due to our own shortcomings .
Each and every one of us is to blame for the situation .
Mr President , I therefore wish to condemn the cynicism and hypocrisy of many Members of this House .
They talk until they are blue in the face about the need for a common security and defence policy .
When they go back in their constituencies , however , they are incapable of asking their voters to endow that same security and defence policy with the necessary resources .
They have failed to understand that a united Europe can be strong whereas a divided Europe is bound to be weak .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe the discrepancy between words and deeds to be a fundamental problem running right through this whole debate .
Let me give a few examples of what I mean .
The Barcelona Summit decided on a study of what are termed the Basle II effects on small and medium-sized enterprises and banks .
To date , it has not been completed .
I take the view that if any study is completed only after the Basle Committee has produced its resolution and after the Commission has decided on a draft directive , it amounts to the squandering of money , to a betrayal of trust and to treating with disdain the resolutions of Parliament and of the Council .
No sooner do we decide on the Stability and Growth Pact , than people question it - some because of Lisbon , some because of the war in Iraq , and others because they lack the courage to reform or because it threatens their comfortable positions .
Rather than ignoring resolutions , we should be implementing them and taking them seriously !
The Lisbon Council resolved unanimously to make Europe , by 2010 , the most competitive and knowledge-based continent , a continent fostering social cohesion , promoting sustainability and creating new jobs .
Where is the actual timetable ?
Where are the detailed objectives ?
Where is the road map ?
Where are the specific and verifiable programmes in all the Member States ?
Good and ambitious objectives need to be followed up by concrete action , or else we lose credibility .
Let me now turn to Iraq .
We are working towards a common foreign , security and defence Policy , but when it comes to the crunch , each does his own thing .
We want to strengthen the UN , but not even the EU 's two permanent members of the Security Council are making any effort to find a common approach .
As President Prodi has shown us , we make demands of the Convention , yet we fail to comply with our own codes of conduct .
We have a chance ; it is called ' more Europe ' .
It is also called ' more United Nations ' .
We will find our opportunity if we stop setting national interests against European objectives , what nations do against what Europe resolves , the trans-Atlantic alliance against a self-confident and enlarged European Union .
Let us follow up the summits with the necessary actions , and let us punish with sanctions any breaches of the Treaties for political reasons .
Those who do not take themselves seriously will not be taken seriously by others , and a more serious approach to things will be worth our while .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , it has been with much concern that I have followed this debate and the preparation of tomorrow 's motions for a resolution . The fact is that two trains are going to collide head-on here , all because we are arguing about who is slightly more , or slightly less , to blame in this matter .
I too have my own personal views on the subject , but they will not help us to make any progress .
We must not allow our capacity for action to be destroyed now by a dispute about who did what badly three or four weeks ago or six months ago , with this war as the result of it .
We should bear in mind the fact that essential elements are at issue here .
This is about such questions as how we deal with the victims , and how we secure the region 's stability , as well as about Europe 's capacity for action in the Middle East and about how we , within the Quartet framework , at last bring about sound solutions .
How can we , in this matter , put this failure on Europe 's part to good use in order to move the Convention forward , in order to prevent Europe 's weakness being the cause of the next such situation , and how do we acquire capacity for action by means of better mechanisms that enable us to unchain the political will that we share ?
Thirdly , this is about how we handle trans-Atlantic relations in future , about in what ways we can put them on new and more stable foundations .
How do we gain acceptance for our knowledge that force is not the appropriate way to create a new world order ?
In particular , how do we save a multilateral world founded upon compromise and upon mutual respect ?
Mr Poettering , the chairman of my group , made reference to Richard Perle .
I do not consider it acceptable for the United States to oblige others to accept its unilateral approach .
The United States cannot decide , alone and on the basis of its own national interests , what is right in this world and what is not .
That approach , which Mr Perle advocates , for example in an article in today 's ' Berliner Zeitung ' , is quite simply unacceptable , for it means that we Europeans have no part whatever in any decisions affecting our vital interests ; it means that we are unable to defend our interests , and also prevents us from making any contribution to world peace .
Mr President , there is no split between Europe and the USA , as it is claimed .
Instead , the split is between France and Germany , principally , and 19 other pro-US new European governments .
Efforts must now be made to tone down the rhetoric on both sides of the Atlantic .
I salute the courage of EU candidate countries who have backed the coalition with specialist forces .
At a meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy last week , Britain was accused of being a rogue state headed by a war criminal .
This shows the ' Alice in Wonderland ' level the debate has now reached .
By joining forces with Germany in the way it did , France has alienated America , undermined the UN , sent the wrong signals - signals of division - to Baghdad and exposed the impossibility of ever achieving a single foreign and security policy .
Saddam Hussein has attempted illegally to acquire weapons of mass destruction for years .
Regime change is the only way to ensure a disarmed and peaceful Iraq and prevent ongoing brutalisation of its people by the Butcher of Baghdad .
The Allies will install a representative government and must prevent refugees flowing out and instability in the region , as well as facilitating the return of the Iraqi diaspora to rebuild their country in safety .
We must guarantee that its massive oil wealth be used to build prosperity for its peoples , not for arms purchases .
This war is morally and politically justifiable and its legality is vested in current UN Security Council Resolutions 678 , 687 and 1441 .
However , the appeasers in this House might like to explain why they embraced a war in Kosovo that involved no weapons of mass destruction or threats to neighbouring states and that had no UN authority whatsoever , and yet find it so difficult to take action against a genocidal dictator who has started two wars responsible for the deaths of almost a million people and who has gassed his own people .
We must end this tyranny and free the Iraqi people once and for all .
On the Lisbon Process , I am delighted that the single market and the need for regulatory impact assessments is now back on the agenda .
My party will continue to oppose tax harmonisation .
Nevertheless , in this area in particular , action will speak louder than words .
The debate is closed .
I have received 12 motions for resolutions , 6 on Iraq and 6 on other matters discussed at the European Council , under Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
The next item is the report ( A5-0077 / 2003 ) by Mr Brok and Mr Wynn , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets , containing the European Parliament 's recommendations to the Council on the introduction in the draft Accession Treaty of a financial framework .
I must inform the House that the Greek Presidency told the European Parliament some time ago that the President-in-Office of the Council would have to leave for the airport straight after his speech in order to be in Greece this evening ready for tomorrow 's meeting of the Council and the representatives of the countries of Latin America .
The Presidency trusts the House will understand .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not need to use all my speaking time , Commissioner , as this is a matter of public knowledge .
What we are dealing with here is the fact that the wording of Article 32 and the declaration of Annex XV to be primary law mean that the Council is in breach of its Agreement with Parliament .
This has to do with Parliament and the candidates for accession not being dealt with in the same way as the other Member States .
This is quite clearly a legal problem , and it is also a problem in terms of a fundamental issue .
Those of us who sit on the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy take an interest in the equal treatment of the candidate countries , but - as Parliament 's fundamental rights are involved - we especially support the position of the Committee on Budgets as well , for budgetary law is the prerogative of any Parliament , and must not be set aside even in a situation such as this .
I do not understand the Council .
Although our dialogues made reference to many options and possibilities , which are also contained in the draft resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow , the Council has adopted none of them , even though that would have made it possible for us to come to an understanding by now .
Responsibility for this lies with the Council .
I am perfectly aware that the Greek Presidency of the Council is making every effort to resolve this , so I am not attacking the Presidency ; this is more about the conduct of a number of the Member States ' governments .
I get the feeling that the government of my own country also has a part in this , and not one about which we can be entirely happy .
I regard it as an unworthy trick to confront ten countries that have made the journey , by way of a great process of transformation , from dictatorship to being invited to join the European Union , with a situation that makes them insecure , and , at the same time , to go about curtailing Parliament 's rights , even though it was the advent of democracy that was crucial in overcoming dictatorship .
That the Council should behave in this way leaves me baffled .
Let me ask the Presidency 's representatives to inform their colleagues that we will not allow the process of European unification to be wrecked by tax inspectors scrutinising certain aspects of the administration of power .
We know perfectly well that , financially speaking , we cannot push this too far ; it would be disproportionate to take excessive advantage of a Budget , for that is not what we are aiming for .
What we are working towards here is a right and a matter of principle .
I think the Council must be able to summon up sufficient creative thought to enable us to resolve this matter , so that the requirements of the law are satisfied and , on 9 April , we in the European Parliament can give the green light to the accession treaties being signed in Athens on 16 April .
Whatever happens , we want that date to be kept to ; it is a duty laid upon us by history .
How will it look if , because of disputes about the Budget , we vote on 9 April for a deferment and the Hungarians hold their referendum on 12 April ?
Are we to sacrifice the stuff of history for the sake of a financial issue like this one ?
So I urge you to get into gear and get a move on once and for all , so that we can come to a speedy decision on this matter and do justice to our historic mission !
Mr President , this Brok-Wynn report has some fundamental statements in it .
The first one , in the first paragraph , is our commitment to making sure that enlargement takes place on 1 May 2004 .
Let us be clear : that it is an objective which we all want to reach .
But in achieving that objective , I for one will not see the rights of Parliament sacrificed .
We have a battle going on at present between two institutions as to what Parliament 's rights are and what they are not .
Whether the Council respects our rights and our prerogatives remains to be seen .
Paragraphs 3 and 4 spell out some pretty clear pictures .
Paragraph 3 warns the Member States that if Article 32 and Annex XV are maintained in the Accession Treaty in their current form , Parliament will regard this as an infringement of its prerogatives in budgetary matters .
Paragraph 4 goes on to say that the Parliament ' considers the Member States ' approach to be a breach of the principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions ' and that it ' interprets this approach as a signal that the Council intends to abandon the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Perspective included therein ' .
Those are not threats , but statements .
I guarantee you now there will be no IAA if Annex XV goes into the treaties unamended or without any guarantees that Parliament 's rights can be maintained .
I now turn to Paragraphs 6 and 7 in the current text of the report .
There will be an amendment from the PPE-DE and PSE Groups to Paragraphs 6 and 7 , to remove the figures , to delete Paragraph 7 , and to put in a statement which will mention our rights again , because this is what this debate is all about .
Tomorrow we will have a trialogue and , hopefully , we will try to get an agreement on a draft declaration .
If we get that agreement , it would certainly be the minimum that I could accept because what we will be doing is agreeing a declaration on how to violate the Treaty .
That is what we are doing .
We are going to agree on how we can violate the Treaty because of Annex XV .
For many years this Parliament and the Committee on Budgets have fought for the rights and the prerogatives of this institution .
We are not here to sell those rights for 30 pieces of silver .
Even if we can agree figures for category 3 in this declaration , do not take that as a sign of Parliament selling itself just for a small amount of money .
I do not intend to be known as the Chairman of the Budgets Committee who sold out those rights for such a small amount of money .
My job as Chairman is to make sure that the rights and privileges that we fought for over so many years are maintained , and I intend to do that .
I make it clear now , and I said it in the Budgets Committee , that if Annex XV is maintained in its current form and if we have no guarantees about our rights I will vote against the Accession Treaty documents .
I may be the only person in this room to do so but I will certainly vote against because I feel that strongly about it .
If we get an agreement in the trialogue tomorrow , we can all celebrate .
There will be something to be cheerful about .
If we do not get an agreement , I should like to point out to the Greek Presidency that if there is another trialogue next week , it can certainly be held in Athens because two of us from that body will be there next week .
We can have the trialogue in Athens and try again .
If , at the end of the day , we cannot get an agreement - and this is the important point - I have no doubt that this House will not delay the vote on 9 April .
The loyalty of this House , as Elmar Brok has said , is to get enlargement in place .
But I will tell you one thing , colleagues : you will not have an interinstitutional agreement and war will have been declared as far as the budget goes for 2004 .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteurs , Mr Brok and Mr Wynn , who respectively chair the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Budgets , have highlighted a very important aspect of the enlargement process in their reports , namely the financial perspectives of enlargement .
On the question of the adjustment of the financial perspectives in order to take account of enlargement , I can assure you that the Greek Presidency , and I am delighted that the speakers acknowledged this , demonstrated that it had the political will to resolve the problem which arose with Parliament right from the start .
And , as President-in-Office , I can assure you once again that the adjustment of the financial perspectives will be exercised in full application of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement .
I should also like to make clear that no one in the Council disputes Parliament 's prerogatives in budgetary matters laid down in the Treaty or the perspectives in the Interinstitutional Agreement .
I should like to inform the House , with regard to the question of the adjustment of the financial perspectives , that Mrs Schreyer gave an initial presentation of the Commission proposal on budgetary matters in Athens on 20 February .
The Presidency asked for this item to be retabled at the tripartite dialogue scheduled to be held in Brussels on 27 March , tomorrow in fact , with a view to settling the matter .
We know , and I personally know , that this is an important and complicated problem .
We understand the sensitivities of the European Parliament and , in accordance with our programme , when this tripartite dialogue is held tomorrow , I should like to be optimistic that an agreement will be found and that the good cooperation between the budgetary authorities achieved over a number of years under the budgetary procedure will continue .
As , therefore , there will be negotiations on the matter tomorrow , I would rather say no more today .
However , I do want to assure you once again that the Presidency and the Council have the political will to settle the matter .
In conclusion , therefore , may I say that I trust that the obstacles to a positive vote by the European Parliament on 9 April will be removed and that we shall have the pleasure of witnessing the signing , on 16 April , in the presence of the President of the European Parliament in Athens , at this historic moment for the European Union .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is approaching a very great event .
The most ambitious enlargement in its history is within our grasp .
This brings to its conclusion a work process lasting many years , and , in Copenhagen , the candidate countries and the Member States were able to come to a good result even on financial issues , which are always tricky .
The financial perspective now has to be adapted to enlargement , and the procedure for this was decided on , as long ago as 1999 , in the Interinstitutional Agreement , which states in very clear terms that this decision is to be taken jointly by the Council and Parliament on a proposal from the Commission .
For Parliament now to say that a deal is a deal is of course to the point .
The Commission very much regrets the present conflict between the institutions , and I do not want to conceal the fact that the Commission advised the Council to take a different course .
The Commission had advised the Council to make explicit reference to the Interinstitutional Agreement , and particularly to Article 25 .
In the present situation , the time for finding negotiated solutions is running out .
The last few days have seen all the parties engaging in dialogue in great depth in order to resolve the issues .
It has to be borne in mind that the draft Treaties have now been finalised by the Member States , and also by the candidate countries .
The search for a solution to the present difficulty has led the Commission to concentrate on the second way referred to in Mr Wynn 's and Mr Brok 's joint resolution .
That Parliament should highlight two alternatives is seen by the Commission as a clear expression of Parliament 's constructive attitude .
The Commission proposal for adapting the financial perspective to enlargement was submitted as long ago as the beginning of this year .
It is made on the basis of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement .
Should both parts of the budgetary authority so desire it , the Commission is now prepared to submit forthwith a proposal for the revision of the financial perspective .
This would be done on the basis of Part C of the Interinstitutional Agreement , and the proposal could contain an increase in the upper limit for Heading 3 , that is , of the budget for internal policies .
This would indeed be in the spirit of enlargement , as it would create additional financial facilities for helping the enlarged Union to grow closer together .
Whilst I believe that we are on the right track , I have to tell you , honourable Members , that tomorrow 's Budget trialogue - which we should take seriously - is doomed to be a success .
The procedures and deadlines leave us , in practical terms , no other choice .
We should make every effort to resolve this issue before the treaties are signed and before Parliament 's resolution , so that , in time for 9 April , the financial perspective can be adapted to enlargement .
I am convinced that all the parties are aware of their great responsibility and will make it possible for us to do what history requires of us .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , you may be quite sure that the European Parliament will play its part with all the power at its disposal and with great commitment - a commitment shared by all the groups and by all the committees that are particularly concerned with Heading III , because it involves over thirty codecision procedures that will be affected by these decisions .
Being conscious of the political responsibility involved in ensuring that the timetable for enlargement is kept to , we have also indicated our willingness to adapt the financial perspective , and to do so if possible before the enlargement agreements are put to the vote .
It is quite clear , though , that you can take it as read , in view of the manifest legal problems that we have to work through at present , and of the opinions and interpretations with which experts have provided us , that we will do everything possible to save and defend Parliament 's rights within the institutional structure .
No decision will be taken here on the basis of an exchange of rights for money .
In tomorrow 's trialogue , the Council has the choice of doing a deal with us or accepting responsibility for the legal , institutional and budgetary problems that the coming months and years will bring .
It is obvious that , despite all their efforts , the Commission and the Council have underestimated the institutional dead-end into which their stubborn refusal to let go of Annex XV and its integration into primary law have led us all .
This is not just about Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement , but about the many statements that were constantly being made on the basis of last November 's agreement , and about common statements arising from many codecision procedures on the multiannual programmes , which repeatedly declared that adjustment of the financial perspective would , at this point in time , be carried out on a joint basis .
Mr President , please permit me another reference to Heading VII .
It is important to me that we hold fast to the de facto impossibility of carrying out a revision by transferring the aid programme for Turkey from Heading IV to Heading VII and then leaving everything in Heading VII just as it is .
We therefore still regard adaptation of Heading VII as a precondition .
This is about pre-accession aid , but also about special and privileged partnerships with the European Union 's neighbours .
It is with this in mind that we will , tomorrow , try to negotiate constructively and find a way on which we can agree .
Mr President , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party strongly supports the accession to the European Union of the candidate countries and the swift handling of the Accession Treaties .
My group , however , is very sceptical as to whether the good levels of cooperation that have existed up till now between the Council and Parliament in budgetary policy can continue .
When the Copenhagen Summit approved the Accession Treaties for the new Member States it also endorsed the necessary financial framework .
There were no discussions at all with the European Parliament with regard to this financial framework , so it cannot be binding on Parliament .
Parliament 's budgetary authority is defined in Article 272 of the EC Treaty .
Now that the Council is to include the financial framework in the Accession Treaties , it is to become EU primary law .
That would be a restriction of Parliament 's budgetary authority beyond that contained in the EC Treaty .
This is a clear infringement of the EC Treaty and Parliament 's competence .
In future Parliament 's competence would be determined under the EC Treaty , which would apply to the old Member States , and by the Accession Treaties , which would apply to the new Member States .
The situation must be considered a mess on the part of the Council .
We doubt in particular whether we can even discuss the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary policy and its review .
Parliament obviously just has to exercise the competence bestowed on it by the EC Treaty fully , as the Council does not respect interinstitutional cooperation .
Mr President , I wish first of all to congratulate Terence Wynn and Elmar Brok on their initiative of tabling this motion for a resolution , which is unquestionably of the utmost importance and extremely timely .
I have already expressed my agreement with this line of action in the exchange of opinions held on the matter in the Conference of Committee Presidents .
I now express this agreement once again - with the particular gratitude and commitment of myself and my group - with the clear and rigorous way in which the motion tabled has addressed this matter .
Indeed , we cannot easily accept the way in which the Council position clearly relegates the powers of the European Parliament to second place and clearly limits these powers , in patent breach of the Treaties and of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary matters .
Nor can we remain indifferent to the fact that the principle of the equality of Member States and the rule of budgetary unity are being trampled on .
Even less can we accept that sums that should not even be considered as the minimum necessary for implementing enlargement should be set as maximum allocations .
I shall not dwell on this issue of the sums earmarked for enlargement , since our position on the matter is already common knowledge , but it is nevertheless worth underlining that , if anything can be emphasised with regard to the position adopted in the motion for a resolution on increasing appropriations for category III of the financial perspective , it is the terms laid down and the obvious clear-headedness of the approach to the matter .
I do not think that the European Parliament can go further than it does in the motion for a resolution .
This is obviously not the time to call enlargement and the timetables planned for its implementation into question . It is crucial , however , at least at this final stage of the process , to ensure a minimum of objectivity , transparency , and respect for the candidate countries and that an end is put to the tight-fisted policy of providing limited means , which has dogged the enlargement process from the very beginning .
It is also crucial , in our opinion , and for this very reason , that a rigorous and firm position of the European Parliament does not collapse at the first sign of rejection or of limited agreement by the Council , which , incidentally , must fully assume its responsibilities for the potential consequences of its unacceptable attitude , which is in clear breach of norms and practices that have been agreed and signed .
Mr President , I am still not quite clear as to whether the problems we are having are caused by an enormous blunder on the part of the Council or whether this is part of a clever strategy .
Either way , neither of the two options is particularly attractive ; let us suppose that the Council just stupidly forgot that the Interinstitutional Agreement in Article 25 specifies that the Council and Parliament must take decisions on changes to the financial perspectives on account of enlargement together .
Let us suppose that it simply did not know that ignoring this article violates the agreement on loyal cooperation between the Council and Parliament and therefore blows it out of the water .
The problem we are then faced with is that the understanding of Parliament 's role and its budget rights has apparently not filtered through into all layers and the fabric of the Council .
It is a blessing in disguise , however , that this problem is easy to solve , because once it realises that , the Council can simply obtain the amounts from the Treaties .
It is , however , more likely that the Council was perfectly well aware of this all along but was gambling on the fact that Parliament would not demand its rights , since delaying the ratification of the enlargement is a nuclear option for which very few Members of Parliament would be keen to take responsibility .
Parliament is not , however , prepared to proceed to the agenda without further ado , and so the Council is now willing to negotiate on texts ; however , these texts will not make the problem go away because the Council wants to keep the amounts in the Treaties unchanged , which in fact violates Parliament 's rights .
Yet it is prepared to state that this resolution leaves Parliament 's rights intact .
What nonsense is this ?
I agree with Mr Wynn ; I can only conclude from this that the Council is offering to ignore the Treaties in future , a kind of Dutch toleration policy .
Drugs are banned under criminal law , but the government and parliament have agreed to tolerate their use .
And that is how it will be in the Treaties .
The amounts will be prescribed but in practice things will turn out differently if the Council and Parliament agree to that .
I would , however , now like to ask my fellow Members how likely it is that the Council will comply with such a statement loyally and in good faith by 2006 .
I do not have much faith in that .
Anyway , my group regards this action as an infringement of the Interinstitutional Agreement , and we will therefore not hesitate , if necessary , to make full use of our rights under Article 272 in the next Budget procedure .
Although the Dutch policy of tolerance is at least pragmatic , this proposal by the Council is also completely absurd in practice , since it is impossible to govern with amounts written in stone .
Supposing there were to be an accident at a nuclear power station , such as that at Temelin in the Czech Republic ?
Would we first have to have a Treaty Amendment with ratification before we could earmark additional funds ?
I think that even the Council would have to admit that it would not like to suffer a self-inflicted injury .
Mr President , the accession of an unprecedented number of new Member States looks likely to bring with it an unprecedented conflict between the Council and Parliament .
A balance of powers between the institutions is essential for the stability of cooperation within the EU .
What the Copenhagen Summit laid down in Annex 15 concerning the financial perspectives for accession countries affects the budgetary right of this Parliament as established in Article 272 of the Treaty .
The Council and Parliament are the two arms of the budget authority and must respect each other in that .
That is why we also have the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999 .
Unilateral establishment of financial perspectives is incompatible with this , even if it were understandable in the light of the situation on conclusion of the accession negotiations .
We do not have a hidden agenda in this matter .
We do not want to jeopardise the Interinstitutional Agreement ; still less do we want to jeopardise the signing of the accession treaties .
Nevertheless it seems as if the Council is in fact doing this by undermining the budget right , which is one of Parliament 's essential prerogatives .
The Presidency has informed us that it has not managed to remove Annex 15 as it is about impending primary legislation .
So Article 272 of the Treaty , the budget right , is valid primary legislation .
As both arms of the budget authority have to agree every year , it is now important that they reach out to each other , preferably tomorrow , but in any event within the next two weeks .
If we do not succeed with an EU of Fifteen , we are putting the EU of Twenty-five at risk .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , Council representatives , at this stage of the debate I do not imagine a single Member of this House is unaware that the inclusion of Annex XV is most unfortunate . It is unfortunate in a legal sense because it calls into question specific rights of the European Parliament .
It is unfortunate in a political sense because it poses a serious threat to the reputation of this House , of the Council itself and of the Commission as guardian of the Treaties .
Indeed , it puts the whole enlargement process at risk .
This unfortunate situation impacts us all .
I should point out that it is particularly painful to those of us who have long argued in favour of the usefulness and validity of an interinstitutional agreement providing credibility and stability for the Union 's financial framework .
In our innocence we believed the interinstitutional agreement was binding on all parties .
Much to our dismay , however , we now find it only seems to be binding on certain Council officials when it suits them .
My group is of the opinion that such delicate implementation calls for a stable and permanent financial framework , recognised by all .
It was not necessary to include the Annex in the Treaty .
Confidence in the interinstitutional agreement would have sufficed , but you lacked that confidence , gentlemen of the Council .
A fresh negotiating proposal is on the table .
This proposal finally provides for Annex XV to be included in the Treaty of Accession , albeit only because you are unable to turn the clock back and retrieve this unfortunate situation , gentlemen .
You are nevertheless in a position to prevent further damage and accept the proposal our representatives will take to the tripartite dialogue tomorrow .
If you fail to do so and bring rigidity and intransigence to bear on what is currently only an unfortunate situation , the scene will be set for something worse .
Then the interinstitutional agreement some of us believe in almost blindly could become the collateral victim and suffer the most damage .
I could give a louder warning but it would be hard to give a clearer one .
Mr President , I never thought I would be driven to make the speech you are about to hear .
You and I are but two of the many who suffered long years of dictatorship .
We all wholeheartedly supported the idea of the reunification of Europe and the creation of a democratic Europe once the countries in the other half of the continent achieved democracy .
In this regard , we were well pleased with the outcome of the Brussels and Copenhagen Summits .
The results might not have been remarkable , but the conclusions were acceptable and took account of the balance between the institutions .
Then the text of this draft Treaty suddenly appeared .
I should emphasise that the Treaty has not yet been signed and therefore everything is still open to amendment .
This includes the deletion of Annex XV we have heard so much about .
The reason is that it contains fixed budget items , together with guidelines on agricultural spending .
In other words , it amounts to suspending the European Parliament 's rights up to 2007 in some cases and up to 2013 in others .
This is inconceivable .
We seem to have fallen down a black hole and be back in 1970 .
I find it quite intolerable .
The book entitled Allegro ma non troppo by Carlo M. Cipolla comes to mind .
It deals with the basic laws of human stupidity .
I should make it clear this is not intended as a personal reference to our friend on the Council .
A stupid person is defined as someone who causes damage to another person or a group of people without any advantage accruing to himself or herself , or even with some resultant self-damage .
That is exactly what happened here .
A text was introduced in an attempt to harm Parliament .
The result was to damage the enlargement process and introduce unexpected hurdles when we all believed a solution was within our grasp .
An unprecedented dispute then arose because precedents were ignored .
There is no Annex XV in the Treaty for the previous enlargement involving Sweden , Finland and Austria .
It is a new invention and that is really why the difficulty emerged .
Ladies and gentlemen , as other honourable Members have made clear , Parliament is committed to enlargement on 1 May 2004 .
We are not in any way committed to a celebration on 16 April in the shadow of the Acropolis , however , though we would like to be part of it .
We hope to be there , but we cannot accept the creation of different classes of Member States .
We cannot accept restrictions on the competence of the European Parliament either .
We would therefore like to make it quite clear that we are concerned about competence , not about money .
Ladies and gentlemen , we will not sell Parliament 's birthright for a mess of pottage .
Mr President , I too find it sad , as well as quite unnecessary , that we should have this dispute about the budget .
It is hard to understand why the Council should disregard Parliament 's powers and not implement the revision of the multiannual budgetary agreements , or financial perspectives , as might otherwise have been anticipated and as was done in the case of previous enlargements .
Parliament has certainly shown great understanding for the fact that the difficult negotiations concerning the new Member States ' portion of the budget for agriculture and for the Structural Funds are not to be reopened , but we have indicated that what is required must be examined under the heading of internal policy , or expenditure category 3 , for there are a number of problems and , if we do not adjust the budget in the next few years , high-priority areas such as the social dialogue , internal security , training , police cooperation and the creation of a secure working environment could suffer as a result , and we should be unable to fulfil our political priorities .
Allow me to give an example . Many ordinary people fear that enlargement will mean competition from the new Member States in the shape of businesses that do not care two hoots about the working environment .
The new Member States must of course implement EU legislation on the working environment , but what really counts is what is happening out there among businesses .
There is a need to change the culture and to bring about greater awareness , both among businesses and employees , of the need for a secure working environment , and that is something we can do through our agency in Bilbao and by way of the social dialogue . What it requires , however , is an adjustment of the budget , partly because the pre-accession aid in the shape of the Phare programme will dry up as from the end of this year , so the work will in actual fact come to nothing if we do not take action .
The Council must respect Parliament 's powers , Article 272 of the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement . Anything else would be unacceptable and a declaration of war .
Mr President , in order to avoid potential misunderstandings , I too want to emphasise that I am in favour of enlargement , by which I mean enlargement as soon as possible .
The states that want to join us have undertaken a great endeavour , but the resolutions passed by the European Heads of State and of Government in Copenhagen have needlessly created a grave and extremely difficult situation .
Their decision puts them in breach of all the Treaties currently in force and of budgetary law , Parliament 's most important prerogative .
The Council 's actions could be read as a denunciation of the Interinstitutional Agreement in accordance with Article 26 .
With the serious issues within the European Union relating to enlargement having to be resolved and resolution of those relating to the Treaty of Nice still a long way off , that this should happen is the Council 's crowning failure !
It baffles me that such a thing is possible when the Council and the Commission have so much expertise at their disposal , unless the intention is to openly provoke Parliament .
As we all want enlargement , we are faced with the problem of retrospective damage limitation .
When I see , though , how the Council treats treaties and the European Parliament , I have the gravest concerns about what is coming next .
Transparency , democratisation , integration and cooperation are empty words if you do the very opposite .
At the moment , I do not trust them .
As the resolution of this difficult problem will be the subject of ongoing negotiations between Parliament , the Council of Ministers and the Commission even after this decision is adopted , Parliament would be well advised to keep an open mind on all the options for dealing with the accession treaties in April .
As I know from personal conversations with them , many Members of this House very much doubt - just as I do - whether , under such conditions , they should give them their approval .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )

The next item is the joint debate on the Reform of Staff Regulations :
Report ( A5-0069 / 2003 ) by Mr Malcolm Harbour and Mr Manuel Medina Ortega , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending the Staff Regulations of officials and the Conditions of Employment of other servants of the European Communities ( COM ( 2002 ) 213 - C5-0262 / 2002 - 2002 / 0100 ( CNS ) )
Oral question ( O-0019 / 2003 - B5-0087 / 2003 ) to the Commission on the reform of staff regulations .
Mr President , I am very pleased to be opening the debate .
I am drawn to speak before my co-rapporteur merely by reason of being first in the alphabet and not of seniority in this Parliament .
First of all , I very much enjoyed working on the report with Manuel Medina .
I first became engaged in the whole project of the human resources reform in the Commission at the end of 1999 when I was first appointed provisional rapporteur - and subsequently confirmed as rapporteur - for Parliament on the overall strategy .
For me , tonight will hopefully be the major culmination of the process .
I do not believe we will have further debates like this - I see the Commissioner is enthusiastically agreeing with me .
That does not mean to say , however , that this Parliament will not be continuing to take a keen interest in the whole process of the reforms because the regulations themselves have to provide the right framework in which the reforms are carried out .
I also wish to thank colleagues here tonight from the various committees involved .
We may not have accepted all their proposals but I want to assure them that we have considered everything very thoroughly indeed and we want to thank them for their contribution and for working with us .
The report we have put before you tonight , colleagues , contains 55 proposed amendments to the regulation package .
That may sound like a lot , but when you look at the size and complexity of this package you will see that we have actually concentrated on improving and clarifying the basic provisions of the regulations .
There is one important new principle which I will come to later , but the real point I want to make to colleagues tonight is that our role has been to check methodically that the regulations deliver the reforms that you supported strongly when I presented my report to this House in 2001 .
That has been the central part of our task .
It has not been our task to attempt a re-negotiation of fundamental parts of the package .
The Commissioner has spent enough time and has had enough trouble dealing with that process .
Our job has been to look at the politics and the strategy .
You will see that we are basically satisfied that this framework of Staff Regulations will deliver the core parts of the reform : the move to a personnel system where members of staff in all the European institutions will be properly compensated , will be able to exploit their talents and encouraged to progress their careers in a system that rewards their efforts .
That has meant a new grading structure and a new appraisal system .
They are absolutely crucial and we have not sought in any way to alter that part of the process .
In these reforms across the institutions we also introduce a new category of contract staff .
Again , that is an area we have not sought to change .
In the areas we have looked at , we have done so very much in consultation with other institutions , because it is important to understand that these regulations apply all across the European institutions .
Part of our job as the rapporteur team has been to consult staff and executives in other institutions to make sure their needs are fully catered for .
We are proposing more flexibility where institutions want to use it in the grading structure , particularly to retain staff with linguistic duties and specific positions where institutions feel that contract staff may not be appropriate .
Tonight I should like to point out specifically the important task of Parliamentary ushers .
What about the new principles ?
My colleague , Mr Medina Ortega , will say more about this , but the major new point of principle is to propose to you that the existing pension system in today 's world ought to be simplified by removing the current weighting system that is based on a pensioner 's final place of residence .
In contemporary society and with more mobility we really ought to be contemplating a simpler , less bureaucratic system .
We are not at all convinced that the present system can be fully justified in today 's world .
I know there are a lot of discussions going on about the pension system at the moment and the Commissioner may , indeed , refer to that later .
I want to conclude by referring to the politics of the current situation going forward .
We are very conscious , in this House , that the Commissioner is engaged in a major negotiation with Council .
We are only here as an advisory Chamber , but colleagues expect us to press the Parliament 's point of view as far as we possibly can .
We are following the negotiations in Council very closely and we know that pension issues are very important there .
We will be recommending to colleagues in the House tomorrow that they approve all the amendments , but that we should withhold our vote on the final legislative resolution until such time as we are satisfied that the Commissioner has achieved all he is setting out to achieve .
Also , with the oral question that we have tabled for the House tonight , we are asking the Commissioner to come back to this House with the results of the final proposal so that we can ensure he delivers what we are all looking for : the optimum framework to carry the European institutions forward in this current century with an optimum personnel policy for the independent and quality staff we are looking for across the institutions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank the rapporteurs for their splendid report .
I do this in all sincerity and not just because it is my duty to do so .
They have managed to achieve a wide consensus on a subject that is clearly onerous , difficult and complex .
I would also like to thank the committee for the effort they have made in negotiations and in reaching an understanding that has resulted in this positive outcome .
My fellow Member Mr Corbett , who was the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , has been kind enough to let me speak in his place .
This shows the extent to which members of this committee worked in harmony with each other : a member of one particular group is prepared to allow a member of another group to replace him .
We all understood that the task was to amend the Commission 's proposal in order to make it more effective .
The two rapporteurs have just explained some of these amendments .
I would like to refer to one of these amendments which I believe to be very important for Parliament and for the other European institutions .
The amendment distinguishes between an institution supporting decisions regarding staff and the decisions themselves .
The latter have to be made by each of the institutions .
As for the elimination of correction coefficients for pensions , I agree with what the two rapporteurs said .
I would like to make one further comment .
Those who have made equal contributions during their working life as civil servants have the right to equal pensions when they retire .
Mr President , this is how the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has contributed to the report .
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will vote in favour of the report .
We are convinced it represents an improvement on the Commission 's proposal and that it will make the already excellent European civil service even more dynamic and efficient .
Indeed , this is the aim of the reforms .
I would like to echo the previous speaker 's praise of the civil service .
It is ready to incorporate the know-how of civil servants from the ten countries who will become members of the European Union next month .
In this process of reunification , the European Union will practically double in size and its population will increase by a third .
A large number of new civil servants from different cultures will have to be incorporated into the complex system and its administrative procedures .
The new civil servants will need to assimilate to the culture of the European civil service .
I think therefore we were right not to introduce a radical reform but rather a gradual one .
This reform allows the most antiquated concepts to be eliminated .
At the same time , it allows new civil servants to benefit from the wealth of experience of current civil servants who have served the European Union for many years .
These are the staff who have ensured that the European Union is more than a mere alliance or a group of countries .
They have ensured that the Union has brought peace to many and a whole host of benefits to its citizens .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists I should like to express my satisfaction with the work that has been carried out by our committees , and in particular by the rapporteurs , Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega .
Thanks to this work , the draft regulations drawn up by you , Commissioner , now constitute , together with the amendments which I hope you will accept , a balanced whole which should give the staff of our institutions regulations which bring together both tradition and modernity .
Tradition is important , because we are very attached to the idea of preserving the great principles of a civil service which is independent of lobbies or other influences , a civil service which is competent and is recruited through objective and rigorous competitions , and a civil service which has rights and duties that are absolutely clear .
We are also in favour of modernity , however .
After more than thirty years of good and loyal service , the staff regulations for the European Civil Service were in need of serious reform .
Having said that , every innovation has to be assessed in the light of the objectives being sought .
For example , the use of a new category of staff , namely contract staff , however useful it may be , must not lead to the abuse of this formula , because that would run the risk of weakening recruitment conditions and would undermine the workings of our institutions .
Moreover , although we can congratulate ourselves on the equilibrium that we have succeeded in reaching , it is still important that the Council should not disrupt this fragile equilibrium .
My concern follows the Council 's reactions , in particular , to two important questions which are marginal to the regulations but which the Council wants to add to them in order to make an overall package .
These two questions are , on the one hand , the multi-annual salary adaptation method and , on the other hand , and most important , the pension scheme .
On this last point we are rather concerned , Commissioner , because we are seeing the Council link the adoption of the regulations to the adoption of a new pension scheme , whereas you yourself have not yet said anything precise about pensions , and we know how explosive this issue is .
This is why several groups , including ours , have tabled an oral question about pensions , so that you can give us the information that we need before we give the definitive green light to the reform of the staff regulations .
Mr President , I am very pleased to be able to join the House on this debate on the report on the staff regulations , not only because it is always an honour to speak in this House but also because when there has been a very extended period of consideration and so many meetings , a certain family feeling develops .
I am very pleased , therefore , to join so many friends tonight who have been my partners in discussion for what seems like an extremely long time .
It was , however , a very worthwhile experience .
I should like to start by expressing my very deep gratitude to the rapporteurs , Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega for their very thorough , thoughtful and constructive work on this important issue of the reform of the staff regulations .
I also pay tribute to the intensive efforts undertaken by the other members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and to the opinion-giving committees and their draftspersons .
Very substantial work has been done in this House by everyone concerned .
I know that the staff of the institutions will recognise the fact that serious and committed attention has been given by Parliament to their statute , their employment conditions and their future .
I think it will assist the House if I begin by referring to the issues raised in the oral question tabled by four political groups in the House .
I was naturally going to highlight several pension issues in my statement this evening .
I therefore welcome the questions because they give me the first opportunity since last Wednesday 's General Affairs Council to focus explicitly and publicly on those matters .
Responding to the question may mean that I take a little more time than was originally anticipated .
I hope that in a good cause you will bear with me .
To help to ensure clarity I should like to ask the House to refer to the draft guidelines that were adopted without change as the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 18-19 March 2003 .
That document has been circulated .
I regret that it is only in French and English at this juncture .
If honourable Members look at Paragraph B of those conclusions they will see that the Council instructed Coreper to prepare a more detailed position , ' on the issue of adaptation of the pension system ' .
If Members then turn to Paragraph D , they will see that the Council called on the Commission to ' table by April 2003 a detailed , technical working document setting out a proposal to guarantee actuarial balance as from 1 January 2004 ' .
Examination of those paragraphs will show that the only request to the Commission was for a proposal for the methodology for a study which would then facilitate calculation of the contributions required to ensure actuarial balance in the pension system .
Therefore there was no request to the Commission to submit , in the words of the question , a detailed document that includes a change in the pension scheme .
Obviously , the Commission will not be producing such a document at any stage .
We have never produced such a document and we are not going to do it now .
Achieving and maintaining an actuarial balance is clearly a somewhat different issue .
As honourable Members will know , this has always been the obligation under the present Article 83 ( 4 ) of the Staff Regulations , even though the requirement has not been made consistently operational .
The Commission 's proposal on modernisation of the staff regulations has always , therefore , included a commitment to ensure actuarial balance .
Of course , the issue was discussed and negotiated in detail with the trade unions and in the interinstitutional staff regulations committee well before the Commission proposal went to the Council and came to this House last year .
So , there is nothing new about the Commission 's commitment to secure actuarial balance .
There is nothing that has not been fully debated and assessed .
There is nothing that was not made known and made clear to Parliament and the members of the EU civil service and their staff representatives .
All that the reference in the General Affairs Council conclusions relates to is the need for an up-to-date actuarial study that will enable the Council and the EU civil service to know , well before 1 January 2004 , exactly what the contribution rates by Member States and by staff will be .
Meanwhile , the instruction to Coreper in the General Affairs Council conclusions is to provide a more detailed position on adaptation of the pension system that , in the words of the conclusions , is more consistent with the trends prevailing in Member States .
That in itself is not surprising since it is obvious that demographic changes , the Lisbon strategy and indeed the policy approach of the Commission and of this House to so-called ' active ageing ' will always ensure that Member State governments give attention to issues of retirement and pensions .
That reality has in fact ensured that several Member State delegations have put forward a paper on pension parameters for the European Union civil service , and it is being considered by the Council .
Our response has been to point out that whilst we recognise the need to ensure consistency with the social and economic policy on employment and ageing which we , in the Commission , advocate , we also emphatically require proper account to be taken of some basic facts about the employment age profile of the European Union civil service , which are of great relevance to any consideration of pension parameters .
Those facts are , in brief : first that that average starting age of employment in the EU civil service is 32 years and 34 years for policy grade officials .
Any calculations that made a full pension dependant on more than 35 years of employment and payments would consequently be entirely unrealistic .
Second , there is the fact that , as your rapporteurs point out , whilst the official pensionable age in the EU civil service is relatively low at 60 years , the average real retirement age of 63.1 years is about three years later than the average retirement age in Member States and one year later than in the Member State with the highest average retirement age .
In many respects therefore , we are implementing a core policy of the Lisbon Strategy and we have been doing so for several decades .
Against that background and in the context of actuarial balance , the Commission has , in the course of negotiations , indicated some willingness to consider a degree of possible modification of the formal pensionable age .
I should like to emphasise that there has been absolutely no conclusion of any kind on that point , or indeed on the other points .
In this and in all other matters we have strongly emphasised the need to ensure that the acquired rights and legitimate expectations of present staff are properly respected .
That clearly manifests our position .
It answers the first question in the oral question .
For reasons of emphasis I repeat that any discussion of any potential changes would have to fulfil that requirement on acquired rights and legitimate expectations .
Increased understanding of those facts induced the Council to ask Coreper to go away and , as the conclusions of the Council show , prepare a more detailed position by the April General Affairs Council .
In addition and to complete the picture , the GAC conclusions include Paragraph C that proposes further discussions on the weightings that are currently applied to EU civil service pensions in different Member States .
I know that there are a number of amendments before the House relating to these weightings .
The issue is a source of general concern in this House and indeed in the Council .
Since we are in negotiations , the Commission can only say at this juncture that we hear those concerns and while we may not support the amendments that have so far been offered , we are aware of the need to deal with this matter within the overall balance of the negotiated final package .
I reiterate that in this context , as well as in the wider spheres of reform , the Commission will at all times actively seek to uphold the accumulated rights and legitimate expectations of current staff .
That is a principle that we uphold and it is one that is understood by Member States .
I also emphasise that we are conducting the negotiations on the basis of the fundamental principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed .
Any decision on any issue would be subject to reaching an agreement that is mutually satisfactory in overall terms .
I would add that we are engaged in complex and sometimes necessarily delicate negotiations ; we are not engaged in polemical exchanges .
We have confidence in the strength and the realism of our arguments and of our arithmetic .
We will continue to strive to ensure that our partners in negotiation in the Council will accept both the arguments and the arithmetic .
That , obviously , is our sustained and unchanging objective .
I regret that I have had to take time to give a detailed response on the important question put by honourable Members .
I think you will understand that I wanted to give full answers to the questions on this important issue of pensions .
I warmly welcome the fact that the report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market before this House for debate reiterates strong support , as we have heard from the rapporteurs , for the overall reform package and does so in serious , practical terms .
In particular I welcome the realistic commitment to the importance of maintaining competitive levels of pay and pensions ; a commitment to the introduction of what has become known in shorthand as a promotion guarantee on a collective basis - and I emphasise a collective basis ; and a commitment to the inclusion in the staff regulations of ' the method ' as the rational , economical and stable means for adjusting pay and pensions .
Moreover , I am pleased to say that the guidelines adopted by the General Affairs Council of 18-19 March 2003 echo many of the principles stated by Messrs Harbour and Medina Ortega in their explanatory statement and they are equally reflected in numerous amendments before us today .
In particular , the guidelines in the Council conclusions - Paragraphs E , F and G respectively - express support for the broad pay and allowances proposals as a good basis , support the transitional arrangements for the new career system and express an openness towards the inclusion , on a finite basis , of the ' the method ' in the Staff Regulations .
In response to the amendments , I will first list the many that the Commission can readily support .
Indeed , I will summarise them because I do not want to test the patience of the House .
Amendments Nos 7 , 8 , 9 and 48 on the strengthening of interinstitutional cooperation ; Amendment No 20 on whistleblowing , Amendments Nos 12 and 14 ; Amendment No 13 on the opening of the assistant 1 to assistant 3 career bracket for specific duties including the duties of parliamentary ushers ; Amendments Nos 9 , 25 , 48 , 50 and 51 tabled by the rapporteurs relating to the status of the staff of the political groups - this means of course that the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 32 and 60 which go well beyond the position set out wisely by the rapporteurs ; Amendment No 17 on sexual harassment , we can accept ; Amendment No 18 , Amendment No 19 , Amendments Nos 33 , 34 and 35 on staff absences ; Amendments Nos 42 , 43 and 44 on disciplinary procedures ; Amendment No 38 on the duration of the membership of the joint advisory committee for professional incompetence - that does not mean that it is in favour of incompetence , of course - it should be the joint advisory committee on professional incompetence .
There is second group of amendments on which the Commission is prepared to maintain an open mind during negotiations on the overall package or to accept some of the amendments , at least in part .
The Commission cannot at this juncture give a positive response to amendments on weighted pensions .
However , as I said , we are of course conscious of the widespread political concerns relating to pension coefficients and of the need to deal with the matter within the overall balance of the total package .
The Commission is prepared to accept Amendments Nos 52 and 54 on the limitation of levels of function of contract agents and on the duration of those contracts ; Amendments Nos 14 , 15 , 26 , 29 and 30 relate to central provisions in the context of a new career system , Article 5 ( 3 ) on the criteria for appointments to the administrator and assistant function groups ; Article 31 on the organisation of competitions for higher grades , including middle management grades , and Article 45 on the certification procedure for transfers from assistant to administrative function groups .
All of these Articles have , I am glad to say , been subject to intense discussions in Council and Coreper .
The compromises reached as recently as last week will be seen to reflect many , if not all , of the objectives aimed at by Members of this House in their amendments .
Article 31 now allows for the organisation of competitions , for instance , at administrator grades 9 , 10 , 11 or , on an exceptional basis , 12 .
Remembering that administrator grade 12 will correspond to a higher level than today 's grade A4 , the total number of candidates appointed to vacant posts at these grades will not exceed 20 % of the total number of the appointments by external recruitment to the administrator function group in any one year .
That compromise goes further than the outcome sought , for example , by Amendment No 26 .
On the certification procedure , Article 45a now makes provision , in Paragraph 2 , for the European Personnel Selection Office to determine the contents of all examinations organised by the institutions in order to ensure that the basic requirements of a transfer are met in a harmonised and consistent manner .
That should make Amendment No 30 redundant .
On Amendments Nos 58 and 59 on Members ' assistants , this House knows the Commission has been and always will be very aware and sympathetic to the concerns about this issue in Parliament .
Honourable Members will however be aware that of course several Member States do not share our joint enthusiasm and there is much work to be done independently of the negotiations on the staff statute .
On Amendments Nos 71 to 74 inclusive , on the recruitment of third country nationals with a permanent right of residence , the Commission is aware that there is a discussion amongst political groups about the possibility of finding a compromise arrangement on this issue which is of concern to many honourable Members .
While sympathetic , the Commission is not in a position to accept these amendments as they are currently formulated and therefore I have to reserve my position on this question for the time being .
Finally , and I am grateful for the patience of the House , there are inevitably some amendments which the Commission cannot accept because they would tend to detract from the overall proposal .
I will just pick a few , by no means an exhaustive list , but I must say it is outweighed by the number of amendments that we are readily accepting .
We cannot accept Amendment No 16 , Amendments Nos 14 , 15 , 26 , 29 , 30 and 75 - for the reason that I mentioned earlier , i.e. that they are unnecessary because of positive developments in Council on these questions ; Amendments Nos 53 , 55 and 76 on contract agents - because , as I said earlier , the Commission supports Amendments Nos 52 and 54 from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ; Amendment No 32 on the extension of Article 50 to administrator grade 12 - we do not think that would be appropriate ; Amendment No 63 on sexual harassment where the Commission supports the text put by the rapporteurs in Amendment No 17 , and finally Amendment No 64 on the expatriation allowance , for the very direct reason that the Commission retains the view that the allowance for staff who are expatriate workers is objectively justified and indeed objectively necessary .
As the House knows , we have from the outset been committed to providing reforms in the Staff Regulations which would facilitate radical modernisation whilst upholding the current conditions of employment and improving the career development of members of the European Union civil service .
The reasons for that are , I hope , recognised to be practical and justified and not insular or conservative .
There is a direct connection between reform , motivation and necessary material security .
It is both realistic and relevant to acknowledge and to provide for that .
This very substantial report from honourable Members recognises that practical reality and is a significant step towards the fulfilment of our commitments .
I warmly thank all who have been engaged in the compilation of Parliament 's view and I very much look forward to the adoption of the report in the House tomorrow morning .
Mr President , the European Commission , whatever may be said to the contrary , is a fact of political life and has a burgeoning public sector in which its rapidly developing separate administration is the prime factor .
And although this administration is expanding continually and taking on new duties , the necessary adjustments have not yet been made .
Its staffing regulations are in need of reform now more than ever if we are to successfully modernise its personnel policy .
We all know that technological progress has invalidated traditional staffing structures , as the private sector realised some time ago .
We likewise know that the European Union is promoting a series of policies , such as measures to improve employment standards , combat discrimination , reconcile working and family life and introduce flexible employment .
It would be strange if it failed to incorporate all the policies which it promotes for European society and European businesses in its own bureaucratic mechanism and if it failed to set an example for a new public administration standard .
Time is short and I should therefore like to focus in my speech on three amendments .
The first concerns the adoption of an amendment introducing a weighting into pension calculations , regardless of the pensioner 's place of residence .
The Commission proposal to introduce a weighting to adjust pensions to the purchasing power in the pensioner 's place of residence runs counter to the Community principle of equality and the right of free establishment .
I support the amendment by our group to secure a climate of peace within the institutions ' administrative services .
It is important to emphasise that , in the new working world which is emerging , safeguarding mutual trust on all sides is the key to increasing productivity .
Finally , I think that we should vote in favour of adopting the amendment by our group changing contracts of fixed duration to contracts of indefinite duration where five-year contracts are renewed for a further five years .
I think that this , in conjunction with recruitment of contractual agents , will allow us to achieve flexibility with the required degree of protection .
Mr President , like everybody else , I too would like to pay tribute to our two rapporteurs for their cross-party working .
Indeed , I must say that when Mr Kinnock referred to a family reunion I feel like something of an interloper .
We wanted to ensure that the ELDR voice was heard tonight , heard to congratulate our rapporteurs and the Commissioner and to say that we very much support the work that is being done in this reform process .
It is a recognition that we are moving towards a modern civil service for Europe and a proper career structure for those who work in it .
There perhaps has to be a certain irony that we , as legislators , spend much of our time demanding change and modernisation of those we legislate for .
Now are putting our own House in order .
I will not rehearse all the many good things that other speakers have referred to that rightly find their place in the Regulations .
But I would like to say something about the pension question .
I am grateful to the Commissioner for his very long and worthy answer to the oral question , and I would like to underline what he said .
Acquired rights and legitimate expectations of existing staff must be paramount and that must be honoured .
The other matter to which I would like to draw attention - and I am sorry that it seems that , whilst there is sympathy , it will not find full recognition - is that of the position of our parliamentary assistants .
Amendments Nos 58 and 59 are there to try to regularise and give status to those who serve us as individual MEPs .
This is something that is long overdue and has to find its place , eventually , in the mechanisms and workings of this House .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , obviously I join with other Members in thanking our two rapporteurs , but I should also like to pay tribute to the European civil servants .
Just imagine : 25 000 people manage this unlikely continent which invents a new future for itself every day .
It is a tremendous task and at the moment it is being performed to perfection .
Thank you , therefore , to the civil servants who support us .
This report , Commissioner , contains interesting and balanced elements , particularly after the amendments proposed by Parliament .
They are appropriate in order to make the European Civil Service more dynamic .
I shall not repeat what some other Members have said , better than I could .
I shall concentrate on Amendments Nos 58 and 59 which would enable us to treat parliamentary assistants as contract staff of the Communities .
These amendments are very positive .
They were tabled - and at this point I shall address the Council bench so that it can take note - by the five major groups in the House .
Consequently , before the Council waves them away with a flick of its somewhat disdainful hand , I invite it to take a closer look at them .
If the Council needs a moment to reflect , that will in no way detract from its responsibilities towards the European Parliament with regard to the Gillig report , a report on the same subject which has been awaiting attention for too long .
That report made it possible to amend a rule so as to give our assistants the option of choosing their national social insurance cover .
The fact that the Council has not yet reacted shows a lack of respect for the agreement which it concluded with Parliament , and in legal terms it places it in an utterly impossible position .
As the Vice-President responsible for this matter , whose patience , I can assure you , is pretty well exhausted , if this blocking tactic persists , I shall be obliged to condemn publicly and vigorously the nature of the blocking and those who are responsible for it .
If that were to happen , it is by no means certain that certain Member States who pretend to be ardent supporters of social policy and transparency will emerge with their pretensions increased or even intact .
Mr President , I also congratulate the two rapporteurs .
They have achieved a large degree of consensus which seemed impossible just a few months ago .
It is also important to mark the importance of this item of legislation .
It is in legislative terms the second and final major tranche of the Commission reform programme , so when the Council adopts this proposal all the essential building blocks will be in place for making sure the Commission becomes more efficient and more effective than it has ever been .
As the Commissioner knows , I would have liked this proposal to go further in some respects .
For instance the expatriation allowance he referred to .
This is an anachronism in a Europe in which we have a labour market where people can move freely from one country to another .
So we will support the amendments tabled by the Verts / ALE Group on this .
Equally , the pensions issue where , frankly , the hysterical reaction from some of the trade unions masks the fact that something does need to be done to bring the pension system into line with the outside world .
I support the package as a whole because it will mean major improvements to the way the Commission works .
I would also like to focus on the one specific issue previous speakers have already addressed , which is the question of parliamentary assistants .
The Commissioner also referred to it .
It is very sad that , so far , this House has been unable to ensure that all parliamentary assistants are properly paid and have adequate social security cover .
A survey by the Assistants ' Association concluded that a number of years ago 53 % of assistants had no medical cover , 46 % were not insured against accidents in the workplace and 53 % had no travel insurance while on mission .
The political groups have now tabled a joint amendment which could help us break the deadlock .
We are proposing that parliamentary assistants should become contract staff in the sense of the Staff Regulations , while leaving the detailed rules to the European Parliament .
This would provide a solid basis for a solution that would be acceptable to all and finally end the uncertainty the assistants currently face .
I sincerely hope the Commission will back our amendment , despite what the Commissioner just said , and help us convince the Council that something must be done .
Parliamentary assistants must no longer be treated as second-rate citizens in the institutions , when the smooth functioning of these institutions largely depends on them .
Mr President , I asked for the opportunity to speak in order to draw attention to an aspect of the coming reforms of the Public Service Statute that has been neglected in the discussions to date .
I am talking about the condition under which the unmarried partner of a European official may claim equal treatment .
In other words , to be treated the same as if he or she were the married partner of the official .
I believe the Commissioner when he says that he has often done that , that the purpose of the whole reform operation is to change an obsolete regime to reflect modern times .
I believe , however , that his proposals do not meet this criterion , because he only wants to treat so-called non-traditional forms of cohabitation as equal if the people concerned can provide formal recognition by a Member State and only in cases in which they do not have access to legal marriage .
This approach introduces discrimination by nationality , continues to give priority to marriage and does not solve the problem .
Many unmarried couples will be unable to meet these conditions .
The Commissioner is obviously overlooking the fact that there are not only couples who cannot marry , but also those who do not wish to .
His proposal furthermore does not do justice to the special position of European officials .
I am therefore pleased that in the report by Mr Medina Ortega and Mr Harbour , which we have before us , a better solution is being put forward in Amendment No 39 .
This is a solution which , incidentally , has been practised for many years by the European Central Bank .
This rule is characterised by the beauty of its simplicity and also offers equal treatment to those who form a de facto household .
Up to now I have not heard the Commissioner say that he would not follow Parliament 's wish on this point .
May I then conclude - and I remain optimistic - that he will in fact do so and that he will use all his verve and eloquence to plead for Amendment No 39 in the Council too ?
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the report ( A5-0061 / 2003 ) by Mrs Van Brempt , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides ( 2002 / 2277 ( INI ) ) .
. ( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for ten years now there has been a broad consensus in Europe about tackling the pesticide problem .
There is also a broad consensus that the present legislative framework is inadequate and must be supplemented by a Community strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides .
That is why in my report I also welcome in detail all the Commission 's proposals .
I believe that the Commission 's proposals are good but not ambitious enough , and the Commission is also not ambitious enough in its timetable .
Given the resistance to the report and the vote on it in the Commission that we Members of the European Parliament have all experienced over the last few days , I would nevertheless like to linger for a moment on a number of challenges regarding this problem which concerns us all .
Pesticides are increasingly becoming an environmental and health problem .
We are not only talking about obsolete stocks of pesticides here , however , although it is important to tackle that problem very meticulously .
We are talking about much more than that , however ; our drinking water , our surface water and our groundwater contain more and more residues , and these days even rainwater no longer complies with drinking water standards .
Drinking water companies must invest capital to remove these residues .
Furthermore , about half of our fresh food contains residues .
The medical evidence that pesticides cause a number of Western diseases should be causing us great concern .
Pesticides cause cancer , mental illnesses and fertility problems .
If farmers are having to produce our food in a sort of spacesuit , should we not be asking ourselves whether we should not be organising our food production differently ?
For all these reasons , and for so many other reasons too numerous to mention here due to a lack of time , I want to emphasise in my report that we need a strategy to reduce use as well as a strategy to reduce risks .
A sustainable solution for the future also lies in a systematic reduction in the use of chemicals in favour of preventative and other alternative measures .
We will not solve resistance problems by using more but by using less .
I challenge all of you to find a doctor who says that the problem of resistance to antibiotics can be solved by using more antibiotics .
We know that this is impossible , so as far as that is concerned let us recognise the reality of the situation .
The second point for attention for which there is a consensus in this Parliament is the need for greater scope for the strategy .
Yes , the agricultural sector is extremely important , but governments - particularly local authorities - amateur gardeners , industry and the railways are also major users and it really would be foolish not to include these in our strategy .
We must therefore not ignore these , just as we should not ignore the use of biocides .
Another difficult problem that is particularly controversial is the use of GMOs .
Do we want to go from bad to worse or do we want to aim for sustainability ?
After all , the vast majority of genetically modified crops are resistant to herbicides .
The agrochemical industry has promised that genetically modified crops will contribute greatly to reducing the use of pesticides and their risks .
I would like to believe this , I would like to be open to it , but reality is proving them wrong .
These promises are not currently coming true ; after a few years , genetically-modified soya , genetically-modified maize and genetically-modified beet all require more herbicides than conventionally farmed crops .
In our report we are asking for the precautionary principle to be applied and for GMOs not to simply be used as a safe and sustainable alternative .
I am asking for no more than this , but I am also asking for no less .
Then there is the cost .
In Europe we have still not properly added up what the use of pesticides actually costs society .
As long as ten years ago the United States calculated that the social costs amount to approximately USD 2.5 to 4 billion per year .
The question is : do we want to internalise that in the cost price , do we want the polluter to pay ?
That brings us to the use of taxes and levies .
Ladies and gentlemen , we all know that the present regulatory framework is inadequate .
We are all in favour of setting out a number of steps .
I am therefore asking my fellow MEPs to support the report , which I know is especially ambitious .
- ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , the Commissioner has just explained the details of the Commission 's thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides .
Clearly , the proposals amount to a statement of the actions the Commission intends to take in the near future .
To this end , it will either introduce measures of its own or submit legislative proposals to Parliament and to the Council of Ministers of the European Union .
Essentially , this report seeks to respond to people 's concern about the possible negative effects of pesticides .
They can affect human health , animal health and also the environment .
I would stress that this is mainly the case when they are not used in a rational or legal manner
Nonetheless , the Commission 's proposal contains significant gaps .
A great number of comments have therefore been made .
The executive arm of the Community should take these into account when it comes to spelling out specific measures .
I would like to highlight what I believe to be the most relevant of the comments received .
Firstly , the Commission 's proposal does not take account of the different problems encountered in using pesticides in different regions in Europe .
The fact that the report does not differentiate between the regions of Europe will lead to false conclusions when the approach is applied in different areas .
Secondly , it is not clear whether the Commission considers that organic farming should be the future model for agriculture to be applied throughout the European Union .
Ladies and gentlemen , we should de-mystify organic farming .
I do not wish to remind anyone of the case of nitrophenol .
Natural products and natural processes tend to be mistakenly equated to environmental protection .
Petroleum , strychnine , hemlock and even anthrax are natural substances , but it is unacceptable to introduce these into the environment .
Organic farming uses natural products but this does not mean it is the most desirable form of farming or the most desirable in every case .
There is no mention of Community policy on integrated production in the Commission 's proposal either .
This is an important type of production that cannot be overlooked , especially as regards the use of plant protection products .
The proposal does not take account of our ability to significantly reduce the use of pesticides through the use of genetically modified organisms .
This would of course require fully transparent regulations to ensure there would be no negative repercussions .
Lastly , I would like to highlight another issue the Commission has failed to deal with .
There is no reference to the approach to be followed in establishing appropriate indicators to measure the effectiveness of the different courses of action to ensure the objectives set out in the Commission 's document are met .
Ladies and gentlemen , all these provisions should also apply to the candidate countries and to all countries trading with the European Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to argue realistically - not emotionally , and certainly not ideologically .
Plant protection agents contain substances that protect cultivated plants and keep them free of pests and diseases , and they can be applied and used in many ways .
They are often indispensable in vegetable and fruit growing and in viticulture , for a producer 's economic yield is essentially dependent on a good harvest , on which a business relies for its income and its survival .
We cannot therefore take away from users the option of using plant protection agents where necessary .
It is clear to all of us that the effects of plant protection agents are not only beneficial .
They can also involve hazards to human health and to the environment .
Ten years ago , we enacted at EU level our own directive on plant protection agents , which stipulates in the most precise terms which active agent may be used on which plant and for what purpose .
The Commission communication is supplementary to it , aims to manage risks better , and is therefore a step in absolutely the right direction .
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats endorses measures to further train farmers in state-of-the-art and targeted applications of plant protection agents , promotion of alternative concepts such as what is termed integrated crop management , harmonisation of VAT rates on plant protection agents in order to remove existing distortions of competition in the internal market , careful disposal of packaging and expert testing of agricultural machinery , for we see it as particularly important to maintain the purity of our drinking water .
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats is , in principle , in favour of the proper and up-to-date use of plant protection agents .
Risks can be reduced only if cooperation between producers , users and the authorities is maximised .
Mrs Van Brempt 's report goes beyond the Commission communication .
Above all else , a legally-binding 50 % reduction in the use of plant protection agents would involve additional risks .
Experts have warned that such a reduction encourages the development of resistance .
The resultant higher incidence of weeds then makes it necessary to use plant protection agents in larger quantities .
As Mrs Redondo Jim√©nez pointed out earlier , the use of an active agent is , however , far more a matter of location , local weather conditions and a plant 's general condition in terms of development and health .
An obligatory levy on plant protection agents certainly does not minimise risks in real terms , any more than would the introduction of a pesticides passport and a total ban on spraying from the air .
Any such ban would impose severe limitations , especially in viticulture .
Ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats cannot support the points I have just mentioned in Mrs Van Brempt 's report .
I therefore ask the Members of this House to support a realisable and practicable approach , one that will reduce risk without hindering users in their work , for Europe 's fruit , vegetable and cereal farmers produce food for us all .
Mr President , this report from the Commission backs sustainability throughout the economy , which primarily means reducing the consumption of resources and using progressive standards to put a stop as soon as possible to economic activities that harm the environment .
If we are to do this , we must remove the barriers we ourselves have erected , which , in environmental policy , are mainly to be found at the level of the nation state .
That agriculture 's core activity is the production of healthy , safe and high-quality food is not a matter of dispute , but despite that - or indeed because of it - we have to be able to say that there is little disagreement among farmers that , in the interests of viable food production , plant protection agents should be applied to cultivated plants in order to avoid the reduction of yield or quality as a result of disease , pests and weeds .
The public associate the word ' pesticide ' with poisons in the soil , plants and food ; for many of them , who are at odds with farmers , it has become a rallying cry , but the reality is quite different .

Without plant protection agents , the cultivation of fruit and vegetables and the production of wine are not manageable , so the only thing to do is to use the minimum of chemical agents to protect the plants from pathogens , pests and weed invasion while at the same time applying more powerful biological and mechanical alternatives .
I see it as a key component of a sustainable plant protection strategy that integrated cultivation should become the normal mode of production in society .
This will minimise the adverse effects of plant protection agents right across the countryside .
However , an ecological rural economy will not enable this objective to be as generally achieved as it has to be .
To say that is to state a sober fact and is no denial of the need to support the ecological rural economy .
There are certain specific things that I regard as necessary and deserving of support . Harmonisation of maximum residue levels in food derived from plants across the EU is indispensable in order to protect consumers in the EU 's internal market .
What is no less necessary is harmonised licensing of plant protection agents .
The mutual recognition principle must be allowed in each Member State until such time as that is accomplished .
That is what the promotion of equal opportunities in competition requires .
With the present problems in fruit-growing and horticulture in mind , I urge that , before the substitution principle is introduced , the effects of the reduction in the agents permitted in the EU - from over 800 to some 300 by the end of 2000 - should be analysed .
Existing notification procedures have not been laid down for anything like a sufficient period of time .
As a result , we end up with restrictions , application provisions with time limits , or debt , the worst alternative solution , which is no sort of solution at all .
Under the current scheme of things , manufacturers of plant protection agents are required to guarantee that their products meet the prescribed safety standards .
Public scandals demonstrate the failure to consistently regulate these procedures .
I am convinced that serious and genuine solutions will be achieved only when an obligation to label requires that the manufacturers of precursors give end users all the information that they need .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , although food scandals are frequent topics of discussion in this House , we are not talking about the everyday scandal that our food contains , unfortunately , far too much in the way of pesticides .
A number of speakers have already pointed out how it is a proven fact that pesticides can cause cancer .
Studies have shown how , for example , in Norway , the children of agricultural workers are at significantly greater risk of cancer .
Other studies of a similar kind demonstrate that there is a clear causative link involved , and so we must make every effort , and the Commission too must send out a clear message by making pesticide reduction programmes mandatory .
Countries such as Denmark and Sweden have shown us that pesticide reduction programmes can achieve a reduction in pesticide use of up to 70 % within only a few years , without agricultural yields suffering as a result .
A study by the American Environmental Agency made clear years ago that 90 % of all pesticides are superfluous .
Just imagine it - 90 % of all pesticides are not needed !
At the end of the day , the farmers who think that more is best , even though the very opposite is the case , also come off badly .
So I would like , once again , to make it very clear that our group - as we have already shown in relation to Mr Lannoye 's report - is committed to reducing the use of pesticides and wants to use a levy to ensure that their prices reflect the ecological facts , for , at the end of the day , it is the consumers who must pay higher prices for groundwater because pesticides continue to be so cheap and are used in such large quantities .
What is of the essence is that we want labelling to bring about greater transparency .
Our problem is that , where the control of pesticides is concerned , the control authorities in the Member States are groping in the dark , because , to take one example , the German authorities do not know what pesticides are used in Spain or in Greece .
The consequence of this is that we need some sort of labelling , a sort of passport , if effective controls are to be possible at all .
I do think that this is where we have to make a really big effort , as excessive use of pesticides eventually means that we also have to consider the health costs involved .
My great plea to you , Commissioner , is that your strategy should bring about a real reduction in pesticide use and make possible more labelling for the benefit of consumers .
Mr President , the use of pesticides will remain a necessary evil for the time being .
Large-scale agriculture depends on these substances for the production of crops .
It is not for nothing that these substances are known as plant protection products in the agricultural sector .
We have known for decades that these substances cause problems for human and animal health .
Today I read yet another report about grapes on the shelves of cut-price shops containing vastly excessive levels of plant protection product residues .
It is well known that water companies have fewer and fewer opportunities to obtain clean drinking water .
It is therefore important to reduce the use of pesticides and encourage the use of organic alternatives .
I am in principle in favour of clear objectives and timetables for every Member State .
These binding national programmes must , however , take the current situation and the national and regional action programmes into account .
As some Member States have already taken far-reaching measures to reduce the use of , the risks from and dependency on pesticides , it is reasonable to anticipate this .
It is over-simplistic to attempt to reduce the use of pesticides by 50 % within a period of 10 years .
It is better to try to achieve an equal level of use throughout the different Member States .
In other words , it does not mean that every Member State will have to reduce its usage by 50 % but it will depend on what a Member State has already achieved .
We should be aiming for harmonisation in the licensing of pesticides in order to prevent unfair competition , so the various pesticides should be evaluated more quickly .
If we can achieve this harmonisation , a European tax on pesticides will no longer be necessary .
The discussion on taxes will only result in delays in the Council , amongst other places .
It is therefore better to leave the introduction of any taxes to the individual Member States .
Finally I would like to argue in favour of accepting some of the Amendments put forward by the Liberals and the Christian Democrats , particularly Nos 1 , 3 , 6 , 8 and 9 .
In exchange for this , we can also expect wider support for the Van Brempt report , which that report deserves .
Mr President , naturally I extend my compliments for the work on the motion for a resolution but , considering it very carefully , I also have significant doubts , which I hope are not caused by some sort of accumulation in my subconscious .
In fact , each time that we talk about these issues , it seems to be almost a form of hatred for the farmers who buy and use phytosanitary products to guarantee their crop yields and exclude qualitative problems caused by pests and diseases .
I have a fundamental question : whether quality can be separated from the concept of profitability of farms .
It is clear that when I talk of quality - with the breadth of meaning of this concept - I am referring to the various stages of the production chain .
Studying the Commission 's proposal , I cannot see a fitting analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the initiatives proposed in the thematic strategies which have been put forward for our consideration .
This is a point which we have included in our Parliamentary position , but , following a logical thread , I get lost , because immediately afterwards I would like to understand the reasoning behind item 2 of the motion for a resolution - I am referring to Amendment No 10 - which proposes a minimum objective of a 50 % reduction of the use of pesticides .
I consider this to be a completely arbitrary figure , which does not take into account the qualitative aspects of phytosanitary products and , above all , overlooks the economic aspects of crop protection .
A final point concerns GMOs : this is a sensitive , problematic issue , too often dealt with in demagogic rather than scientific terms .
In my opinion , use of the precautionary principle for GMOs calls for an appropriate level of consistency with the Union 's studies which are already underway and have not yet been completed .
In this respect , the Commission has taken a very serious and wise position , indicating in the field trials when to evaluate the use of GMOs with the related risk of pesticide use .
This is the right way to get tangible answers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I can tell the Commissioner that the communication has already achieved one thing , and that is a broad-based process of discussion and consultation with all the groups affected .
That is to be welcomed .
Over the years , the European Union has brought into being and implemented many directives and regulations relating to pesticides , some about the marketing of them , others about banning them from being marketed , but also about their use .
So I see it as high time that the existing rules were implemented in full and their effectiveness assessed .
The approval system needs to be improved .
I see Community-wide licensing procedures for marketing as one of the indispensable principles of the common internal market .
Substances permitted in such places as Italy , Luxembourg and Belgium cannot be banned in Austria or Germany .
As far as I am concerned , a mere strategy of reduction - Mrs Van Brempt , in her report , proposes a reduction of 50 % - is not efficient .
Any reduction in the quantities used will always be dependent on the effectiveness of the means used .
It is self-evident that integrated husbandry has become part of everyday agricultural life .
Methods of cultivation using low levels of pesticide use must be promoted and developed more vigorously , with risks being minimised and the protection of rural cultures - which is so necessary - being ensured .
This is what makes counterproductive the prevention of professional and targeted application of pesticides using helicopters .
Airborne plant protection means that a committee of experts takes integrated plant protection as its basis when deciding whether this treatment should be applied , and , if so , when and with how much .
I see that as safer than if every small-time vinedresser or winegrower decides for himself and ends up on a steep slope right in a cloud of the plant protection agent he is spraying .
I am firmly opposed to the introduction of levies and taxes on plant protection agents .
Increased cost means weaker competitiveness rather than leading to any real reduction in the use of pesticides .
Let me say in conclusion that it is not acceptable that the European agricultural sector should be able to import from third countries foodstuffs and feedingstuffs treated with active agents prohibited in the EU .
Mr President , I will not repeat those things , which I support , already mentioned by my many colleagues in the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats - Mrs Redondo , Mr Perez , Mrs Klass and Mrs M√ºller - but I would just like to mention a couple of elements .
Mrs Van Brempt wants a general 50 % reduction .
That means that those who have already done well and have therefore cut their usage by a great deal more must reduce it again by another 50 % .
That means that the good are penalised , and that cannot be right .
So a general 50 % reduction is not right .
Secondly , she talks about a distance of three metres from waterways .
You must realise what that means , but in general , wherever there are a lot of things growing , you tend to find water .
That means that particularly in areas where the natural conditions are good , efficient producers will ultimately be penalised .
That cannot be right ; it does not work that way .
The third point is that I am amazed that discussions about GMOs and crop protection are being mixed up here .
I think that these discussions should be kept separate .
I myself am very wary when it comes to GMOs , I acknowledge that , but I think that they have no place in this discussion .
My fourth point is that the entire crop protection policy should be aimed at encouraging proper targets and not purely at punishment .
I cannot see any sign of that in the report , and I would like to wholeheartedly advise everyone in Parliament to vote in favour of the PPE-DE amendments , as that means that we will get our feet back on the ground a little and at the same time work together to try and do things even better in the future .
Mr President , I will keep it short , but I would like to say something to the people who might be listening to this debate there - who knows .
It is very striking ; this is the first time I have ever heard such a battery of members of the European People 's Party / European Democrat Group all saying the same thing one after the other .
For the benefit of those listening , this Parliament does actually have other groups with different opinions .
Having said that , I would like very briefly to eliminate a few prejudices .
For there are people here who would dearly like to class me as ' a bit other-worldly , a bit na√Øve ' , ' someone who sits in their office working out rather peculiar proposals ' .
I really have not done that ; I have , however , had a look , I have taken advice and I have , for example , seen that there has effectively been quite significant reduction in other Member States of the European Union , like in our esteemed Commissioner 's country .
What can be done in Sweden can also be done in the Netherlands , in Belgium and in the United Kingdom .
We can do that if we want to .
I challenge everyone to scrutinise my report .
Nowhere do I say that I am opposed to pesticides .
I know they are necessary , even advisable .
We can , however , cut down on their use .
A reduction in use naturally goes hand in hand with a reduction in risk , which I believe to be more important , but because there is a consensus on this , I have not focused on it .
I have also always maintained in the committee that this 50 % is not a fetish of mine .
Perhaps we should put 30 % , perhaps 40 % , perhaps 60 % , but I would definitely like to see a target .
After all , we all know that if this Parliament does not set a target , we will not actually make any progress .
We must make sure - and this is one of the amendments I have submitted in the plenary session - that the efforts that have already been made by the other Member States and the efforts we still need to make , which differ from Member State to Member State , are also taken into consideration .
Let me once again ask the members of the European People 's Party / European Democrat Group not to look at my report dogmatically .
I also try not to do that myself .
I would like to say one more thing briefly .
Everyone has run over their time , and they have all said the same thing , so I just want to say something about taxes .
Someone said : ' Naturally the taxes will not make the risks decrease . ' I am not stupid , I know that too .
Why do we need these taxes ?
In order to ensure that the polluter-pays principle is implemented effectively . There are very many social costs , and I ask you : do you think that it is normal for everyone to bear the social costs or should they be borne in an honest way by the products that pollute ?
That is one of the many challenges .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal for a directive has set ambitious aims for itself : to protect health and the environment .
We can readily agree with the proposal and the rapporteur with regard to the care that needs to be taken with nonylphenol and with nonylphenol ethoxylate , the dangers of which are well known and which cannot be addressed by any means other than a proposal for a directive .
We have serious reservations , however , about the need and the appropriateness of the directive on cement , on various grounds .
Firstly , we believe it to be technically wrong and politically surprising that the same legislative text covers both unquestionably dangerous products and cement .
Secondly , we believe that clearly insufficient time has elapsed since the implementation of directive 2001 / 60 / EEC on labelling to be able to draw safe conclusions about its adequacy or otherwise in reducing or eliminating the most worrying cases in this field .
Thirdly , the information available does not enable us to corroborate , with the apparent certainty that some Members have , a genuine and rigorous risk assessment of chromium VI , which , as we know , is still a cause for controversy amongst specialists .
Lastly , if these limitations are adopted , we feel that to some extent we will have accepted a form of discrimination which , by means of derogations , favours producers and the bulk cement trade over bagged cement .
We are therefore opposed in particular to Amendments Nos 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 and 43 , and if these are adopted we shall , unfortunately , feel obliged to vote against the report .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Mr President , I am undeservedly deputising for Mr Nistic√≤ , the rapporteur , who is unable to be here , and I assure Commissioner Liikanen that I will pass on his thanks and compliments .
For my fellow Members ' information , I will therefore very briefly describe the measure which we will be voting on tomorrow and , as Commissioner Liikanen already said , represents common ground which the Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee has supported , endorsed and which it commends to the House for a positive vote tomorrow .
As Commissioner Liikanen has already said , this is an amendment to the twenty-third amendment of Directive 76 / 769 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations ( substances classified as carcinogens , mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction ) .
The proposal , based on Article 95 of the Treaty , has two main objectives : to safeguard the internal market by introducing harmonised provisions on the marketing and use of the above-mentioned substances and to achieve a high level of protection for human health and the environment .
It is appropriate to point out that we are talking about 25 substances in particular , 14 of which are classified as category 2 carcinogens , such as some cobalt salts , cadmium , benzopyrene , azoic colouring agents and so on ; three of these are classified as mutagens and eight as toxic to reproduction .
For example , it has been established that cobalt causes carcinogenic effects in laboratory animals and in human beings , particularly lung cancer and myocardial tissue tumours ; cadmium powders , for their part , can cause testicular cancer in addition to lung cancer .
As can therefore be inferred from these brief examples , we are dealing with highly dangerous substances .
During the last year and a half to two years of work , Parliament adopted at first reading , in February 2002 , two amendments which the Council , in June 2003 , partly accepted by adopting its common position .
At its second reading in 2002 , Parliament adopted an amendment to the recitals .
We have therefore reached the final part of this conciliation , of these three stages and , as has already been pointed out , the problem that still needed to be settled did not concern the substances , but the products which may contain these substances .
Well , the agreement on the sole point at issue during conciliation stipulates that the Commission must submit as soon as possible a legislative proposal aimed at banning the use of products - products this time - containing substances classified as carcinogens , mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction where , however - and emphasising this is very important to the rapporteur - there is scientific evidence that these substances are released by such products , thereby exposing the general public to the risks described above .
This is why the delegation considers the obtained results to be satisfactory for Parliament and commends it to the House for adoption .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is the oral question ( B5-0086 / 2003 ) by Mr Struan Stevenson on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries concerning problems with the implementation of Regulation No 2561 / 2001 ( EC ) aiming to promote the conversion of the fishing fleet operating under the fishing agreement with Morocco .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in January of this year , my staff , together with the Spanish authorities , visited the affected areas in Spain that are under discussion today and agreed that the funds provided for the final decommissioning of ships , for the modernisation of the vessels and for the setting-up of joint ventures , are being used in a satisfactory way .
The same cannot be said , however , for the way funds are being used on social measures , and this is where there are problems .
The reason why the fishermen are not making full use of the funds provided for social measures is that they are unable to fulfil certain of the conditions in our regulation .
The fact is that fishermen who have lost their jobs because of the failure to extend the Agreement with Morocco , receive a compensation payment only if their employer allows his ship to be broken up or if he sets up a joint enterprise .
If , though the ship continues to fish in other third-country waters - or indeed in Community waters - for example , under a private licence , they are not entitled to any payment in compensation .
That is also essentially logical , as such ships are still active in the fisheries sector and it can therefore be assumed that their crews continue to be employed .
We have now agreed with the Spanish authorities that they will inform the Commission as to where and for what reasons social problems arise as a result of ships not being broken up , and no entitlement to structural funds exists .
On the subject of items 1 and 2 in your motion for a resolution , I can , then , tell honourable Members that we will come to a decision without delay as soon as we have all the data we have requested from the Spanish Government and have the opportunity to examine it .
Item 3 of your resolution does , of course , have something to do with this .
If the Commission comes to the conclusion that we should decide in favour , we will of course also modify the repayment of some of these sums in such a way as to ensure that the fishermen receive equal treatment .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and also Mr Stevenson for the solidarity he has shown for Galicia as chairman of the Committee on Fisheries .
Ladies and gentlemen , though there are not many Members present in the Chamber at this time of night , I would like to point out that the renewal of the agreement with Morocco was one of the most important objectives of the Committee on Fisheries .
When this agreement was not achieved , we went out of our way to ensure that the budget that had been earmarked for the agreement would go instead to the fisherman affected .
After some very difficult political and budgetary negotiations we secured this money .
The practical application of the regulations approved demonstrated to us the need to improve them .
We did not want any potential beneficiary to be deprived of even a single euro .
We worked with great determination to rectify the situation .
This is the purpose of the resolution we will vote on tomorrow , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries .
The proposal we have tabled has been improved by the contributions of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
A consensus was reached rapidly , and I think we should all congratulate ourselves on this .
I believe the Commission should accept in full the proposals we will vote on tomorrow .
These will amend Regulation ( EC ) No 2561 / 2001 and ensure better social cover .
This is what we want and what the Commission wants , and I believe it should be achieved .
Mr President , it is with indignation and sorrow that I rise to speak on the proclaimed death of an industry - the fishing industry - which has been and should continue to be of economic importance to my country .
The Community Fisheries Agreement with Morocco expired on 30 November 1999 .
Portugal neighbours that country , has obvious maritime connections , and a considerable part of its fishing fleet was directly involved in the fishing activities covered by this agreement .
Portuguese and Spanish fishermen have been hard hit by the non-renewal of the agreement because in many cases they have been unable to fish , which means that they have been unable to work .
I do not wish to return to the political assessment we made at the time of the failure headed by Commissioner Franz Fischler , who has today completely ignored the Portuguese fishermen .
What I wish to emphasise is the inaction and the lack of diligence at the time I have referred to , to which we can add the ineptitude of the way in which the measures of support for the ship-owners and fishermen affected were drawn up .
These people have been denied the right to fish and to work , and although they have been compensated with support measures for fleet conversion and for individual premiums , they have come up against Community legislation that is quite inflexible , inappropriate and whose implementation involves difficulties that are almost impossible to resolve .
It is regrettable that legislation should have been drafted in the aim of resolving situations such as this one but , instead , has further complicated the lives of the fishermen affected .
The lack of flexibility of the 2001 Regulation and the various administrative difficulties concerning the deadlines set for implementation have prevented or could invalidate access by fishermen to the exceptional support actions that have been planned , particularly to socioeconomic measures , the allocation of which turns on requirements that their beneficiaries cannot meet .
It has , therefore , become crucial for the Commission to set things right and what is needed urgently is a proposal for an amendment to the Regulation in order to resolve the implementing problems that have arisen , particularly a change to the allocation requirements for the premium due to the fishermen .
In fact , making the allocation of the individual premium of EUR 12 000 to anyone who is not a shipowner , but merely an employee , dependent on scrapping vessels amounts to taking away with one hand what is given with the other .
I shall conclude , Mr President , Commissioner , in the hope that this situation is duly corrected and that the Commission rapidly submits its proposal in the aim of effectively correcting the injustices created following the expiry of the Fisheries Agreement between the Community and Morocco .
Mr President , Commissioner , we can now make an evaluation of the implementation of these measures . I think two of these are extremely relevant .
The first , and perhaps the most important - to which various Members have already referred - is the excessive rigidity with regard to the payment conditions for aid of EUR 12 000 to crew members .
As we know , in order for these people to receive the money , the vessels on which they worked must have been scrapped or integrated into joint ventures .
And yet the Commissioner said that the Commission shared the view that if the vessels have not been scrapped or integrated into joint ventures it is because they are fishing elsewhere and the crew members are therefore employed .
This is an erroneous assumption , however , because although in some cases shipowners do actually manage to send their vessels to fish in other fishing grounds , they are only able to make a partial profit , or to provide a partial alternative to what they had previously in the Moroccan fishing grounds .
In other cases , the shipowners themselves are waiting for an alternative for the future .
Whereas they are waiting or whereas they have partial alternatives , the crew members or fishermen of the vessels that previously fished in Morocco are now unemployed and inactive .
This is why this situation must be reviewed as a matter of urgency and why crew members , who are entirely blameless in the matter , should not be sacrificed .
The second element of rigidity concerns the fact that , at the time the agreement with Morocco lapsed , some shipowners were building vessels to fish in that country 's waters .
As the agreement lapsed , these shipowners had to convert these vessels and refit them for other fishing grounds .
This refit of the vessels entailed increased costs , which were borne by the shipowners .
I think it would be fair , under the current regulation or under any other , for Community co-financing to be provided to cover this rise in shipowners ' costs .
I shall finish by saying , as other Members have done , that these matters must be resolved .
They will not cost any more money ; what is needed in order to resolve these problems is for flexibility to be shown .
Thank you , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will be held tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5-0027 / 2003 ) by Mr Caudron , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community participation in a research and development programme aimed at developing new clinical interventions to combat HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis through a long term partnership between Europe and the developing countries , undertaken by a number of Member States and Norway ( COM ( 2002 ) 474 - C5-0392 / 2002 - 2002 / 0211 ( COD ) )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in 2001 , 14 EU Member States and Norway took the initiative of combining their research and clinical intervention efforts in the fight against AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries under the EDCTP programme .
The aim of this research programme is to speed up the development and evaluation of new vaccines and drugs through a partnership between Europe and some fifteen developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa .
The Commission believes that it is in the Community 's interest to be associated with an initiative of this kind , particularly against the background of creating the European Research Area .
It proposes to do this by applying Article 169 of the Treaty , under which the Community may , in implementing the framework programme , participate in research programmes undertaken by several Member States .
The Commission 's specific proposal is to provide for a financial contribution of EUR 200 million from EU funds , which is earmarked in the Sixth Framework Research and Development Programme .
I would like to highlight the fact that this is a new departure in institutional terms , as this will be the first time Article 169 of the Treaty has actually been used .
Setting up the programme of clinical trials , the EDCTP programme , is an example of putting the European Research Area into practice .
This will provide real added value for Europe and for developing countries , and I would like to illustrate a few aspects of this .
This programme will enable us to integrate national and Community efforts by networking and pooling activities which up to now have been disparate and uncoordinated .
The platform to be created should make it possible to transfer research results more rapidly so as to assist clinical development in developing countries , and I wish to emphasise that this will involve those countries ' full participation .
It will enhance the impact of public investment by means of a more coherent and targeted approach .
It will enable us to assemble a critical mass of expertise and resources needed to carry out large-scale clinical trials by optimising the use of European research results , particularly those of public research .
It will increase clinical development capacity in developing countries in terms of infrastructure and training .
The EDCTP represents a new approach which will bring industry and the public sector together in risk sharing and developing new kinds of partnership which are urgently needed to combat the disastrous effects of these diseases .
Industry has a key role to play in all the activities under the EDCTP programme .
The programme will finance research and development products for which industry can not expect any return on its investment .
Public financing will make research more attractive to industry , without taking industry 's place .
The creation of new solid and effective public / private partnerships is a vital condition for the success of the programme .
To conclude , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for the first time in the history of European research , we are in a position to adopt an ambitious programme which brings together the Member States ' research activities and establishes a genuine partnership between Europe and Africa for clinical trials , a partnership which I hope will receive your support and thus get under way as quickly as possible .
Let us seize this opportunity today and provide ourselves with the means to take full advantage of this first opportunity .
We will earn the gratitude of researchers in Africa and Europe , and above all the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa , on whom these terrible diseases are taking a heavy toll .
Mr President , Commissioner , congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Caudron , for the excellent results attained on a programme which , rhetoric apart , can truly be defined as a real challenge for civilisation so to speak , equality between the northern and southern hemispheres .
Moreover , the best aspect of this work is that the Commission 's proposal is an unprecedented innovation in that , although Article 169 is an excellent formulation , it is being applied in practice for the first time , and , by taking this line , we are creating a genuine , tangible partnership to address a real problem concerning the northern and southern hemispheres .
This initiative is so astute that it should be repeated in both the research sector and other key areas of the Union 's foreign relations .
Since I agree with the position set out by the rapporteur , I will make three very brief remarks .
Firstly , I think that it was a positive decision not to extend the programme to related diseases , not because they are less important , but because we should not disperse our resources and efforts .
Moreover , the results can be used to improve the treatment of other diseases and can form the basis of new research activities , thereby contributing to resolving other health issues related to the problems experienced by developing countries .
Secondly , regarding Amendment No 13 - involvement of the private sector - I believe that it is particularly important to involve the private sector in the programme because this will enable additional funds to be leveraged , encouraging businesses to invest more in diseases which affect developing countries .
In this connection , a debate on tax differentiation mechanisms could be an extremely interesting incentive .
The third point concerns the protection of intellectual property .
Involvement of the pharmaceutical industry is essential for the success of the programme .
We must have differentiated pricing for medicines sold in developing countries and , in my opinion , we need different labels as well to prevent fraud .
Mr President , the health crisis in developing countries is unprecedented .
Given the huge need for drugs , the lack of attention on the part of the pharmaceutical industry is astounding .
I particularly welcome the Commission 's initiative to set up a platform for clinical trials .
It is an excellent idea to bring all the activities in the Member States and the developing countries together under one umbrella as far as possible .
Individual research activities are useful , but not necessarily useful enough .
Article 169 offers the perfect basis for joining forces ; indeed , a united effort is exactly what the developing countries need - and also exactly what Europe itself needs .
Europe can make a difference in the world if it pulls together .
Europe can address the health crisis and social distress .
For this , public leadership is required , and today we see a glimmer of the public leadership that the EU should have .
I give Mr Caudron my sincere thanks for the energy with which he has handled this dossier .
I support his approach and wish to raise once more the three concerns I have spoken about before now .
Firstly , we have to see to it that industry is involved in this project .
This is only possible if we set up a credible programme .
As it is , industry is bringing out few new products .
It is a good time to set up joint projects , therefore .
There must be a reasonable return on investment for industry , but the emphasis must be on the public interest , the development of affordable drugs .
We must not deceive ourselves that public research institutes can manage the task alone .
For this reason , we must not invest in bureaucracy , but in cooperation with the private sector , too .
Secondly , we must focus on developing specific products .
We all know that a great deal needs to be done in order to combat the health crisis , but it is not necessary to fund malaria nets out of this budget , useful though they are .
Thirdly , AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis are a good place to start .
These three diseases claim the most victims and are spreading with devastating effect .
There are , however , other diseases , such as sleeping sickness and river blindness , which have been neglected .
We should be concerned about a disease like leprosy rearing its head again .
New means are necessary to combat this old disease .
I ask that the Commissioner and the Commission continue to give due attention to this , too .
Commissioner Busquin , I welcome the fact that the health crisis is high on your political agenda , and I also thank you for the letter you recently sent to the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
We support this clinical trials project wholeheartedly .
Europe certainly needs a flagship : a model of cooperation which bears fruit .
Making this fruit visible will enable this project to act as a stimulus for joining forces in other fields , too .
Europe is not doing the world justice if it does not work together , and it is not doing itself justice if it does not derive any inspiration from the cooperation in the field of clinical trials .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , combating poverty in the developing countries is the priority of the European Union 's current policy .
HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis are poverty-related diseases which are rampant in the developing countries .
It beggars belief that in some developing countries , for example , there is a shortage of teachers because half of the teaching workforce has AIDS .
It is high time that the European Union pays special attention to this problem , and so I join the previous speakers in welcoming the Commission 's initiative to invoke Article 169 of the Treaty in order that the Sixth Framework Programme for Research can be used to develop new clinical interventions to combat HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis .
By establishing networks and coordinating national and regional research programmes , the EU can make a sizeable contribution towards a more efficient policy on research into the development of methods for combating the three above-mentioned diseases .
Involving the developing countries themselves , through the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership , enables the work to be much more purposeful and means that the research is brought closer to the people concerned .
I think that that last point , in particular , is extremely important .
In his excellent report , the rapporteur also dotted a few more i 's and crossed a few more t 's .
I welcome that , but I should like to make a couple of short comments .
The research programmes should not just focus on the development of new drugs , but also on the question as to the simplest way to administer those drugs .
How often does one hear the complaint that , although patients in remote areas of developing countries can find their way to a health centre , when they get the drugs home , they stop taking the medication as soon as they feel better .
This results in the development of resistant forms of the disease , as has happened with malaria .
This is clearly counter-productive .
The second point to which I should like to draw attention is the synergy with other European programmes .
A large amount of money and high-quality research is required .
The Commission 's proposal to set up the Erasmus Mundus programme will shortly be given the support of our Parliament .
Students from all over the world will then be invited to come and study in Europe .
I should like to ask that students from developing countries , in particular , be given a special chance to take part in this , because the developing countries need highly qualified researchers .
EUR 600 million has been allocated for the present proposal , and another 200 million should be coming from the private sector .
By helping the researchers , industry , too , can and must make its own considerable contribution .

Mr President , I would naturally like to add to the congratulations for the rapporteur - Mr Caudron - who has done excellent work on improving , where necessary , the Commission 's proposal , which is also an extremely important proposal which initiates , in pilot form , what could be a new relationship between the European Union and developing countries on shared issues of world concern .
It has also given rise to proposals and debates in the other committees , as we have seen in the Committee on Development and Cooperation , through the rapporteur for the committee 's opinion , Mrs Ulla Sandbaek , and her pertinent questions .
In fact , as Mr Caudron said , we are at a very special moment , a crucial moment , in terms of the relationship between the developed world and the developing world , because our main concern is to promote a kind of humanitarian relationship , a relationship which has connections with the suffering of the developing world , and therefore the European Union 's main concern at the moment should be to stop the horrendous war taking place in Iraq which is obscene and brings shame on the West .
It is a form of cooperation and , together with this request which the European Union should make , programmes such as the one we are discussing are examples of how much the old Europe , the European Union , can contribute to a world which is different from the one proposed in other places .
I would like to stress the significance of the proposal being made , because it represents going to the very heart of the problem of these three great diseases which successive reports by the WTO have shown to be the most significant , causing death and suffering throughout the world .
I would also like to say that the Horwitz circle , the circle of poverty and illness , cannot only be attacked on one front , and that , while it is true that it is necessary to increase the economic capacity of all countries in order to reduce diseases , it is also the case that we must deal with specific issues which will allow for research , facilitate access to medicines , achieve a different kind of cooperation and also call into question , sometimes , aspects such as intellectual property .
Because those of us who are researchers , doctors and university professors know that the knowledge we have today is not just due to our own efforts , but is an inheritance from centuries of effort on the part of human intelligence aimed at improving the conditions of mankind and is not therefore the exclusive property of an industry , but is part of a common inheritance .
It is therefore important that programmes such as these serve to initiate new stages in support relationships , and because of this inheritance I believe we have an historic debt to Sub-Saharan Africa stemming from the earlier era of colonialism .
Mr President , first of all I very much wish to congratulate G√©rard Caudron on his report concerning the first application of Article 169 of the Treaty to the Sixth Framework Research and Development Programme .
His work has certainly fostered excellent cooperation between us and has facilitated the success of this excellent proposal .
This is due to the courageous initiative taken by Commissioner Busquin , and involves allocating a total of EUR 600 million to large-scale research with the objective of combating HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis under the EDCTP programme .
Because of the importance of that objective and the means being implemented to achieve it , it is vital for us to stress that basic ethical standards need to be respected in relation to this research . We equally need to emphasise that the results of that research should be available for use in the general interest , and that we need to cooperate with developing countries and encourage scientific and technical development in those countries .
The ethical principles in question are those set out in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and those defined in the World Medical Association 's Helsinki Declaration on ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects .
The European and Developing countries Clinical Trials Partnership must apply the good clinical practice defined in Directive 2001 / 20 / EC on the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use in the European Union .
The EDCTP programme should encourage the training of specialists and capacity building in developing countries , step up technology transfer to those countries and mobilise additional resources for the fight against these diseases .
The Community will ensure that these strategic decisions and the implementation of programmes are in line with the objective of placing on the market products that are at the same time effective , accessible at the lowest possible price and easy to use , and adapted to the specific conditions prevailing in developing countries .
These decisions should be based on the active participation of stakeholders from the developing countries , scientific experts from the North and the South , representatives of patient groups , and the NGOs and the WHO .
Finally , our Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance hopes that the results obtained through this programme will be considered a public good , and will therefore not be subject to intellectual property rules such as those defined in the TRIPS agreements , so as to guarantee developing countries access to the treatments resulting from this research at the lowest possible price .
Mr President , the research programme on HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis is necessary because there is relatively little medical research into poverty-related diseases .
The programme is also useful , for example , on account of the close correlation between the scourge of AIDS and the hunger problem .
AIDS weakens the young adults , a group which traditionally determines the degree to which a people is able to withstand famine .
In addition , existing efforts must not be replaced , but rather stepped up .
I should like to ask that the Council and the Commission take pains to ensure that this programme provides a stimulus for Member States and research institutes .
By way of conclusion , there are two aspects that are often neglected with regard to the combating of AIDS .
In a proactive approach , marital fidelity and celibacy are essential elements to be stressed when giving information .
Encouraging results can be seen in this regard in a number of African countries .
I would therefore urge Commissioner Busquin to bring this to the notice of his colleague Mr Nielson once more .
The Creator who gives us the means to help others considerably also gives us commandments with a beneficial effect .
Mr President , I hope that we will soon adopt the Caudron report with a substantial majority at first reading .
The rapporteur has already cited the figures .
Millions of people in developing countries are dying of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis every year .
They are poverty diseases , as has also already been said .
These diseases account for a large proportion of serious illness , but up to now have had only a small research budget .
The help that has been offered up to now has been predominantly therapeutic , and also in the form of information regarding causes and prevention options .
What is special about the project that we are now discussing is that it has the potential to give an impetus to the development of new technologies and new safe , effective drugs for combating these diseases .
The research taking place in this field in the European Union is very fragmented , and very few networks have been established , which has resulted in organisational and economic obstacles to large-scale research and trials .
It is right , therefore , that this proposal makes use of Article 169 of the Treaty , which indeed enables the participation of the European Union in joint research and development programmes .
As has already been said , this is a first , and in my view the experiment is definitely worth the while .
I hope that it will constitute a good start to more intensive cooperation in many fields within the EU .
A very important criterion for our group was that the countries where these diseases are widespread be involved intensively in the setting up , and participate fully in the implementation , of the programme from the outset , and that a large number of the trials take place on site there .
Another point important to our group was that the programme should make a contribution towards capacity-building in the developing countries and ensuring the availability of good , affordable drugs in those countries .
In addition , we , too , value the involvement of the private sector .
By way of conclusion , I am of course proud that the Netherlands has managed to qualify to be allocated a seat of the executive office of the EDCTP .
The Netherlands will devote maximum efforts to making this project a success .
Mr President , congratulations to Mr Busquin and Mr G√©rard Caudron .
G√©rard has worked quickly but he has not been sloppy or careless .
We have been able to put across important points despite working quickly .
This is innovation .
This is a new use of Article 169 which will lead to considerable leverage , with EUR 200 million from the EU plus EUR 200 million from Member States and we hope for at least that much from industry .
In this area the market has failed , as it so often does , and there has been , until now , a certain lack of public leadership , with a particular bottleneck in the clinical trials aspect of finding new products .
We have heard that it is the biggest killer , that 5 million people die a year , 95 % of them in poor countries .
Yesterday , we grieved publicly for the victims of the irresponsible and immoral war in Iraq by wearing black armbands .
We should be wearing them every day for the victims of these killer diseases .
There is , of course , a multi-pronged attack .
This point has been made by other speakers .
Other actions are needed but this particular action is research .
It is for clinical trials which will lead to the development of new products , in particular a new vaccine for tuberculosis , much better diagnostic tools , and combined medicines for HIV / AIDS which are easier to take and have fewer side effects .
That is what we want at the end .
That will be the outcome of these clinical trials .
We have made the point that they must be targeted .
Despite the complexity of the problem let us keep in mind the whole time what we want at the end .
We must strengthen the clinical research capacities in developing countries .
One of the tragedies of our planet is the waste of human intelligence and creativity in countries which have been politically discriminatory or else riven by poverty .
We must encourage that intelligence and creativity by having infrastructure , training and everything else .
Everything must be anchored in the developing countries with an understanding that , should we find these things , should we find a better vaccine for tuberculosis , better drugs for HIV / AIDS and better diagnostic tests , they will be available to those that need them .
It would be the greatest obscenity to do this work , discover the products and then find that those who need them cannot use them .
I am very pleased that has been emphasised and I thank G√©rard Caudron very much for his work as well as , of course , Commissioner Busquin .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission 's study , which supports this proposal , is both terrifying and encouraging .
It is terrifying because it presents a tragic view of the health situation in countries where the three major scourges of this century which we are discussing are concentrated : AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis claim more than five million victims every year .
AIDS is the most recent scourge with , however , 90 % of cases found mainly in developing countries and 70 % in Sub-Saharan Africa : there are more than 40 million infected people .
Malaria reappeared in the 1970s and claims one million victims each year .
Tuberculosis , which has been eradicated from western countries , kills two million people each year , perhaps also , as with malaria , owing to the so-called developed countries irresponsibly lowering their guard .
It is encouraging because of the figures on the new effort being made by all the Member States , which have appropriated EUR 600 million for research in addition to the 100 million stipulated by the Fifth Framework Programme .
It is now important that this programme reaches the recipients directly , overcoming the usual problem of the extremely high cost of medicines , especially for countries which do not have the necessary budgets and which need considerable assistance .
I would therefore reiterate a proposal which has already been put forward in order to cut these costs : the abolition of all royalties for medicines , making , if possible , not just the European Union pharmaceutical companies assume their responsibilities but those all over the world .
In conclusion , it is important for our political activity not to be yet again an end in itself , restricted just to debate in this Chamber : for once , when the Member States and other countries , in conjunction , intend to take real action , let us give an example of pragmatism and responsibility .
Certainly , the Charter of Fundamental Rights matters more than market rules .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to thank the rapporteur for his interesting stories , but we will let him stay in his own little world .
AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria are diseases connected with poverty , and in fact , as has here been said , five million people a year die of them , especially in sub-Saharan Africa .
It is a vicious circle .
Poverty is a barrier to the development of a viable system of medical treatment , while at the same time the diseases prevent development and overcoming poverty .
We need swift action , adequate resources and a comprehensive system of cooperation to break this vicious circle .
A new kind of cooperation is needed .
When would we get 300 000 people to attack disease in the poor countries ?
Instead of bullets we should be using medicine .
This project of ours is unparalleled in terms of its objectives and scope , and all the better for that .
A lack of cooperation and a lack of clinical trial facilities and trained staff in the developing countries have been a barrier to investment up till now .
We need to obtain a critical mass by combining expertise with resources .
We also need a situation where no one makes money from medicines , which are literally a matter of life and death , destined for poor countries .
AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria betray the presence of a crisis in society , as they are responsible for the deaths of so many .
My question to the Commission is this : could we in the Union develop teams responsible for social crisis management , for example groups of one hundred thousand people consisting of doctors , nurses , engineers and teachers ?
Might this not be what we in the European Union need to help others ?
Mr President , I too welcome with great satisfaction the measure being debated today , precisely because it satisfies a series of requirements which are known , I see , to all the MEPs who have decided to discuss it in the Chamber this morning .
The first ground for satisfaction is the fact that this report marks a return to research in sectors such as the pharmaceutical sector , where Europe does too little .
In my opinion , the Sixth Framework Programme and the resources which have been made available under this programme bear witness to Europe 's desire to commit substantial resources to research in this sector , which not only has economic value but social and political value too .
It is not by chance that holding patents and having the possibility to produce medicines and being able to influence their cost , particularly in developing countries , means being able , on the one hand , to press ahead with a development policy for us , and on the other , an aid policy for developing countries .
Many of the Members have stressed how this research , which proposes to help combat diseases by increasing knowledge in order to produce new drugs and to improve existing ones , combines with other policies which we , as Europe , must press ahead with in the education and employment sectors , because education , employment and health are the only factors which can contribute to the achievement of democracy in those countries which see Europe as an increasingly firm point of reference .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Caudron .
I believe that this report is the result of his excellent work carried out as rapporteur on the Sixth Framework Programme for research and technological development , to which , moreover , I contributed as draftsman for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at its initial stage .
The partnership which we are establishing by applying Article 169 , is an innovation , apparently without precedent , and we therefore warmly welcome it : it is a genuine , tangible contribution to the fight against poverty diseases , a fight in which the European Union has shouldered its responsibilities by taking up its position on the front line , as the leading world donor .
The allocated budget - EUR 600 million - is in addition to the series of initiatives implemented since Durban which aim to strengthen and make more effective the fight against these diseases which chiefly affect developing countries : I will mention only the Global Fund , set up at the Genoa G8 summit , and the European Community action programme .
This continuity is certainly a very positive signal , but we increasingly need to do more : five people die of AIDS in Africa every minute ; in 2001 malaria and tuberculosis killed one million and two million victims respectively ; in short , these three diseases are , in fact , holding back the development of the affected countries and are playing their part in keeping them in poverty .

This is why it is necessary , or rather essential , to invest and concentrate all the efforts necessary to obtain a systematic response from the whole of the international community .
This coordinated cooperation between the Member States , the European Union and the private sector , which is using a new , coordinated approach for a long-term Community strategy in the fight against these three diseases , has the considerable merit of actively involving the developing countries themselves , enabling real improvements to be made .
Therefore , in order for this involvement to be effective and efficient , it is essential that it takes place with the maximum transparency , so that the efforts and resources deployed are tangible .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to thank you very sincerely for your contributions .
As the rapporteur , Mr Caudron , said at the beginning of his speech , I believe that we are facing a challenge where time is of the essence .
That is why the will of Parliament , the Council and the Commission to work together in an attempt to coordinate their efforts as swiftly as possible is , as I see it , key for the success of this action , which although it will not of course solve all the problems , will nevertheless make Europe 's efforts in the field of research and development more effective .
What sets this programme apart is that it involves the participation of partners from Africa , where the programme is to be implemented .
Turning to your various contributions , I think that the compromise amendments that you will have to vote on shortly very much reflect the concerns and aspirations expressed by you individually .
It is clear , as I have already said , that this project will not be able to solve every problem , but it is a step forward that should provide us with a model for other actions in the future .
But first of all we need to put this programme into practice .
It is for that reason that I wish to say , on behalf of the Commission , that we are able to accept all 36 compromise amendments , which reflect the spirit of the Commission 's original proposal whilst improving and enriching it .
I would like to emphasise once again the quality of Parliament 's work and of the support the Commission has received .
We have not only had support , our proposal has also been strengthened and given a higher profile .
I regard that higher profile as being very important , because this is a new departure for us .
So it is now up to the Member States to demonstrate the same determination and will , which is always a problem when we try something new .
The programme itself marks a turning point .
I would also like to mention , as some of you raised this point , that the programme forms part of the Commission 's programme of action in a broader sense .
In dealing with AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis we are of course entering the sphere of research , but development , trade and other areas are also involved here .
So this is not an isolated initiative , we will be integrating the programme into the EU 's overall strategy in this area .
By the same token , I would like to say that the joint programme , which is the stage we are embarking on now , is being set up on the basis of the programmes of each individual Member State .
We already have a good deal of knowledge about those programmes , Mrs Sandb√¶k , and we therefore know that there is some duplication of effort .
That is to be expected , but it demonstrates that we are not as efficient as we might be .
So it is now up to us to put that right , in conjunction with the Member States .
What is more , we require a legal basis to apply Article 169 of the Treaty .
The Commission will therefore have to wait for the tripartite agreement between the Commission , the Council and Parliament to be concluded before it can get the Member States to act without further delay to implement this joint programme .
We will only make our financial contribution once the joint programme is under way .
Having said that , Mrs Sandb√¶k , let me reply to your specific question . Concrete actions are now under way , particularly in the area of anti-malarial drugs .
Germany , the United Kingdom and Spain have already mounted operations with three clinical sites in Africa .
A second very concrete example is that of the health school in Vienna , which trains African researchers in the methodology of clinical trials .
So these are some examples of this type of activity .


I would like to finish by very warmly thanking the rapporteur , Mr Caudron , and his shadow rapporteurs , Mr Nistic√≤ , Mr Pi√©trasanta , Mrs Corbey and Mrs Flesch , and all the members of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , including its chairman , Mr Westendorp y Cabeza .
I also of course wish to thank the other committees for their contributions .
I have in mind the Committee on Development and Cooperation and its draftsman , Mrs Sandb√¶k , and the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities .
I also want to comment on the extent to which cooperation between the successive presidencies , that is the Danish and Greek Presidencies , has contributed to progress towards an optimal solution acceptable to everyone .
Mr Caudron has been in a very good position to observe this . I therefore wish to thank the Danish and Greek Presidencies .
Lastly , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that we have all gained a sense of the scale of the tragedy that these diseases represent for developing countries , and particularly for Africa .
We therefore hope that this experiment will yield a positive outcome and that it will open the way for similar initiatives on diseases that are neglected at present .
That is by way of response to a number of questions . I believe that this first example will enable us to demonstrate that by virtue of initiatives carried out under Article 169 , we now have an additional instrument that will allow us to carry out even more effective actions at European level .
We should look at the possibilities which that prospect opens up .
In any case , I wish to thank Parliament for its very effective and helpful contribution .
Mr President , in December 2001 the Commission adopted its Green Paper on the criminal-law protection of the financial interests of the Community and the establishment of a European Prosecutor .
This provoked a broad debate among academics and practitioners beyond legal circles .
That was also its intention and I would like to thank the Commission for it .
The European Parliament , too , got involved in the debate .
Even before the Green Paper appeared , it called in several resolutions for better protection for EU finances through the establishment of a European prosecutor for financial matters , who would deal with the growing number of cases of cross-border crime affecting the EU budget .
The time is ripe .
The EU is on the threshold of enlargement , with ten new Member States acceding in the coming year .
The Community budget will continue to grow , administration of European money will become even more complex .
At the same time , cross-border crime will increase as modern technology makes it increasingly professional .
The territorial fragmentation of criminal law systems and the difficulties in judicial cooperation between Member States are the reason why criminals are seldom caught and even more seldom convicted .
The statistics show that the EU budget loses as much as EUR 1 000 million every year to internationally active organised criminals .
It is possible that this money funds other criminal structures .
Cigarette smuggling is the best example .
European taxpayers ' money is lost for actual EU purposes .
I repeat : lost , since even today we in Europe still do not have efficient structures for the prosecution of EU financial crime .
The Council has recognised the danger in so far as it anchored the protection of financial interests in the first pillar of the Treaty of Maastricht and enshrined cooperation with the Commission in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
With today 's report from the Committee on Budgetary Control , Parliament joins the 72 opinions that the Commission has so far received from various quarters and considered concerning the Green Paper .
Please note that our report is an own-initiative report , not a legislative one .
We on the committee have taken time to make a thorough analysis of the subject of ' establishing a European Prosecutor ' ; we commissioned experts to make external studies and arranged a hearing with the national parliaments and representatives of civil society .
In this report , we are now putting forward options and calling on the Commission to make improvements , especially with regard to safeguarding basic rights and rights of defence , supervision of the European Public Prosecutor and his links with existing structures .
We want links with the existing structures of OLAF , Eurojust and Europol .
We want in that way to avoid duplication , but at the same time we want the Prosecutor to be an efficient instrument for the protection of EU finances at European level .
There are clear proposals as to how the future European Prosecutor could cooperate with the national authorities in the Member States .
The principle of subsidiarity is the maxim here .
All the questions of how the Public Prosecutor 's Office should operate can then be settled by secondary law .
I would like to sincerely thank my colleagues from my committee , and also those from the Committees on Constitutional Affairs , Legal and Home Affairs and Petitions for their positive and constructive cooperation .
Their proposals have been incorporated into this report .
Our main concern is that an appropriate legal basis for the creation of this Public Prosecutor 's Office should be laid down in the Treaty and that the Council should appoint this new organ with the assent of Parliament .
The revision of the treaties remains an essential prerequisite for this , because only a treaty reform can legitimise the proposal .
We call on the European Convention to provide for this legal basis for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to protect the EU 's financial interests now so that it can be placed on the agenda for the 2004 intergovernmental conference .
As I said , the time is ripe .
We want the means to be created in the European Union and for the European Union to strengthen and secure the protection of the Community 's financial interests before enlargement takes place .
We all want an area of freedom , security and justice , where a stop is put to fraud and corruption at the expense of the EU budget and therefore of the European taxpayer .
Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
( IT ) Mr President , I agree with what the rapporteur said and I congratulate her on her report .
The issue of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud is an example of the problems , sluggishness and inadequacy of European Union integration .
The scale and gravity of fraud prejudicial to Community financial interests is clear to all .
Just as clear is the ineffectiveness of the efforts to combat this type of crime , which goes largely unpunished .
The gravity of the situation was condemned by the European Parliament more than 12 years ago .
Years of careful research have led to the drafting of a specific , feasible proposal for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud , governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality , with a corollary of criminal-law and procedural arrangements capable of fairly resolving the majority of issues raised by the need for a centralised criminal-law initiative and for criminal judgments reserved for national judges .
The legal basis for this institution was proposed by the Commission at the Nice intergovernmental conference which , unfortunately , here too , failed for want of a common desire on the part of the governments and a European perspective on the issues .
The launch of intergovernmental judicial cooperation under Eurojust has created more ambitious and less realistic expectations , while it has also created excuses for further delays .
The time for delays has passed : we must implement initiatives which ensure a uniform level of protection of citizens ' fundamental rights in criminal-law proceedings and minimum rules for the admissibility of evidence , and the Convention on the Future of Europe must propose a suitable legal basis in the European Constitution which is sufficiently flexible to allow the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor to combat fraud , capable , in the future , of evolving within the context of Eurojust with wider objectives relating to the fight against cross-border crime .
Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her sterling work .
In its opinion , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs said YES to the establishment of a European Prosecutor .
It said yes because it feels that the problems which the European Union currently faces need a more systematic approach and solution .
At the same time , however , it underlines certain issues which it considers important .
The first issue has to do with the jurisdiction of the European Prosecutor .
Of course , we all agree that the starting point was to combat fraud , which something needs to be done about immediately .
It is a sad fact , unfortunately , but it is a fact nonetheless .
However , the committee pointed out that transnational relations and the collective structures to which Member States take recourse mean that an evolutionary approach must be taken to the jurisdiction of the European Prosecutor , so that , if necessary , powers to combat other crimes can be added at a later date ; unfortunately , as we all know , the current international system is always thinking up new crimes .
The second point made by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerns the role of the European Parliament in relation to the European Prosecutor .
We feel that the European Parliament , which was the first to underline the issues and the problems of pan-European crime , should be the institution to which the European Prosecutor is accountable .
Thirdly , the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor goes hand in hand with the development of European criminal law , which is an inevitable development , and finally , it is , I think , important to point out , within the structure of relations between the European Union and its Member States , how the European Prosecutor will stand in relation to national public prosecutors .
Mr President , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen . Mrs Theato , I am sorry I was not able to be here when you made your speech .
I had a trialogue here in the House that has only just finished .
Fighting European budget fraud is and remains one of the Commission 's most important concerns .
We know that we can count on Parliament unreservedly in this , since it has taken and is taking many initiatives in this field .
We all know that the only appropriate and effective way of tackling crimes against Community finance is for there to be consistent criminal prosecution .
That is why , in 2000 , the Commission proposed including a provision for establishing the office of a European Public Prosecutor in the EC Treaty .
At the time , the Council decided not to do so .
It was in December 2001 that the Commission presented the Green Paper on the criminal-law protection of financial interests and the establishment of a European Prosecutor , which is being discussed today and is the subject of the report .
On the basis of that Green Paper , the Commission initiated a discussion process in 2002 .
The European Parliament , and in particular the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control , Mrs Theato , has made an important contribution to that debate and also given it impetus .
Mrs Theato , everyone here knows that we really would not have made the progress that we have with the project for a European Prosecutor without your active support and your commitment .
I would particularly like to thank you for that on the Commission 's behalf .
Last week , the Commission presented a follow-up report to the Green Paper , summarising the outcome of the public consultation .
Most people who took part in the debate and in the consultation process have a basically positive attitude towards a European Public Prosecutor .
As we all know , the governments had more reservations about it than the members of the legal professions and of the non-governmental organisations , and in particular than people who have to deal with the question every day .
But only a minority are totally against the project .
Over all , however , openness to the project of a European Public Prosecutor has grown appreciably as the year has gone by .
The Commission therefore reaffirms its proposal for the establishment of a Public Prosecutor .
This outcome is all the more important now that the Convention - as someone has already said - has entered its crucial phase .
Specific proposals for a constitution are now being discussed .
Last week the Convention Presidium proposed including an Article 20 about the European Public Prosecutor 's office in the ' Justice and Internal Affairs ' Title , and the Plenum of the Convention will give its opinion on that next week .
In this crucial phase it really is essential that Parliament and the Commission should be pulling in the same direction and sending the Convention a clear message .
It is already a cause for some satisfaction that our common concern has nevertheless come far enough for the European Public Prosecutor 's office to have been given an article of its own in the draft treaty .
The debate has done much to bring this about and it is very much to your credit .
However , the Commission takes the view that the Presidium 's proposal does not go far enough .
It stops short of the actual objective .
What is proposed is a clause empowering the Council to create the office of European Public Prosecutor unanimously at some time in the future .
With an empowerment clause of that nature , the European Prosecutor may well turn out to be an empty promise in an enlarged Union of 25 or more Member States .
That is the risk .
We must therefore anchor the office of the European Prosecutor in the Treaty itself , otherwise it is to be feared that the project really will be postponed indefinitely .
I am glad that Parliament and the Commission are in full and complete agreement on this eminently important and highly political question .
I hope that a large number of amendments will be tabled for the Convention 's plenary session on 3 and 4 April with the aim of creating a European Public Prosecutor in the Treaty itself .
The Commission therefore welcomes the European Parliament 's support , which is expressed very , very clearly in Mrs Theato 's report .
I congratulate you warmly on this report , knowing how much personal commitment lies behind it .
In the Convention 's decision-making phase that now lies before us , it is of the utmost importance that Parliament gives a clear sign .
The Commission agrees with the essentials of Mrs Theato 's report on the Green Paper , as I have said .
But we do not agree entirely on every point .
We are , for example , still debating whether there is a need for a Preliminary Chamber , whether national court control of the Public Prosecutor 's decisions is sufficient or not and whether it can be transferred .
So far as Eurojust is concerned , the Commission also considers it desirable that the European Public Prosecutor 's office should be close to this institution .
We have said more about this in our follow-up report .
There are still doubts about whether this can be achieved effectively by means of a strengthened Eurojust taking on the tasks of the Public Prosecutor 's office .
This is being discussed .
Both functions - the central criminal prosecution of crimes against the Union 's financial interests and the coordination of national criminal prosecution authorities in other areas of crime - could be brought together in a common structure , under the same roof so to speak .
Transferring Eurojust to the first pillar is in this respect a necessary condition but not a sufficient one .
That also has to be made very clear .
The Commission also agrees with the report that some questions connected with the creation of a European Public Prosecutor 's office still need further discussion .
This is true of the question of secondary law .
In our follow-up report we said we wanted to look in more detail at the following questions in particular , namely the question of evidence , so that evidence lawfully collected in one Member State can be admitted in another Member State , and the procedural guarantees for the accused , on which a special consultation is taking place on the basis of another Green Paper presented by my colleague Mr Vitorino .
The Commission will comply with the request of the Committee on Budgetary Control and look at these questions in detail in the course of this year .
In so doing it will be guided by the proposals made by the Convention and in particular also by the work in the field of justice and internal affairs .
The important thing now , however , is that a European criminal prosecution authority should be anchored in the Constitutional Treaty itself with a basis in law for developing the secondary law that will then be necessary .
That is the only way of dealing effectively on the criminal law side with the current difficulties in fighting fraud and corruption that are such a drain on the Community budget .
If we want to help to make the building of Europe more popular with the citizens and taxpayers , we must send an effective signal with the future Treaty .
Mr President , Commissioner , by means of this report presented by Mrs Theato , Parliament is calling on the Convention to include a modification in Article 280 allowing for the creation of a European Prosecutor .
At the heart of this issue lies the concern to protect the financial interests of European taxpayers .
For some time the European Parliament has been calling for the creation of a European Prosecutor with competences relating to the Union 's interests .
It is important to point out the existing differences between the Member States , which result in a lack of efficiency .
We must ensure greater European cooperation and move forward with the creation of a European judicial area .
The role of the European Prosecutor would be to tackle cross-border fraud by means of the adoption of specific rules making it possible to combat that fraud , including the definition of crimes .
The new Constitutional Treaty must make the basis for this European Prosecutor clear , and it should be based on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality , resolving the problems caused by the fragmentation of the current European judicial system .
We must achieve a transparent system which preserves the balance between efficiency and the investigation procedure , in the event of cross-border crime , and respect for fundamental rights , with coherence and cooperation between the existing structures : OLAF , Eurojust , Europol .
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has presented certain amendments aimed at taking this clarification further , and I would therefore ask the other groups to support them .
I would finally like to stress this report 's aim of contributing to the constitutional process under way so that we might clarify this issue of the European Prosecutor , which is enormously important for the future of the Union .
I must congratulate Mrs Theato , who has done an enormous amount of work , which has not been easy , and I hope she will achieve the proposed objective .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House fully supports Mrs Theato 's report and also congratulates her on the work presented to us here .
I believe it is no accident that the Committee on Budgetary Control repeatedly comes forward with such initiatives since we are finding from experience that it is impossible to protect a budget that has now grown to EUR 100 000 million with the funds of 50 years ago , that is with national funds .
This clear statement and such initiatives as today 's Theato report are things we owe to our taxpayers .
They know there have been initiatives like OLAF .
We know everything is not yet perfect .
There are intermediate stages and I believe a Public Prosecutor of this kind will not be the most perfect thing of all time , either .
But it will be a very important step towards protecting Europe 's taxpayers .
And it is important , above all , that Parliament should make clear that this institution will have a democratic foundation .
Europe also has institutions , such as Europol , that are not subject to parliamentary scrutiny , and it is therefore not surprising that people learn from the media that the Member States apparently allow Europol , behind closed doors , to process quite fantastic amounts of money .
Obviously there is no transparency because Parliament is not involved and I believe it is important that we secure these things for the Public Prosecutor .
We have already on occasion - and in other reports - pointed out that we want this Article 280 ( a ) .
Parliament voted on it again two weeks ago in Strasbourg and I hope that here , too , Parliament will back the rapporteur 's third paragraph , which deals with this .
From time to time , quite specific examples make clear how important a Public Prosecutor is for us .
Not long ago , we called on the smallest Member State , Luxembourg , to take action in a case - the so-called Perilux affair - that has been pending at the Luxembourg Public Prosecutor 's office for years .
Massive amounts of European taxpayer 's money are involved .
Luxembourg is not responding , and we must stress from this place once again how important a European Public Prosecutor would be to perhaps give a bit of a kick to Member States that do not take European taxpayers ' interests quite so seriously .
Such cases come up repeatedly and it is particularly annoying in Luxembourg 's case because Belgian courts have already reached findings in the matter .
Again warm congratulations and I think this House will take a good and important decision today with this report !
Mr President , I should like to state that I find it quite unacceptable that fraud involving EU funds should amount to something like two billion a year and even be increasing in some areas .
At the same time , it must however be acknowledged that this is basically a national problem in as much as approximately 80 % of the EU budget is administered by the national authorities .
I think that , in this area , the Member States display a fundamental unwillingness to take the necessary initiatives to deal specifically with fraud involving EU funds .
This is borne out by , for example , the Commission 's statement that , out of every four cases that are brought to light by OLAF and that should lead to the national authorities ' being prosecuted , only one has legal consequences .
I find all this unacceptable .
It does not however lead me unconditionally to endorse Mrs Theato 's conclusion that the optimum and only solution lies in setting up another institution : a common European Prosecutor in the form of a body taking precedence over national legislation and demanding extensive harmonisation in areas in which the Member States traditionally have different legal traditions and legal concepts . I need only mention harmonisation of penal legislation , production of evidence , penalties and the rules governing legal processes .
If we were to implement this model here and now , I would anticipate major conflicts of authority between the common European Prosecutor and the national authorities , as well as some overlap in relation to other Community initiatives such as Eurojust , OLAF and Europol , initiatives that , in view of the short period of time they have been up and running , should at all events be given more time to produce results in areas including that of fraud involving EU funds .
That having been said , however , I do in actual fact support in principle the idea of setting up this authority and embedding it in the treaty .
I just do not think that the time is ripe for such a drastic harmonisation of fundamental areas of legal policy , as proposed by Mrs Theato .
I believe instead that a European Prosecutor 's office should be developed gradually and within the framework of strengthened Eurojust cooperation .
That is , moreover , the model mentioned by Mrs Theato in Article 22 , Paragraph 2 of her report .
In general , it is these considerations that form the basis of the amendments to the report tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , after the establishment of OLAF , the creation of a European Public Prosecutor 's Office would be the next logical step in fighting financial fraud in the EU in the interests of the European taxpayer .
On behalf of my group I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur , Mrs Theato , for the courage and persistence with which she has fought for this matter for years , and I also expressly include Commissioner Schreyer in my thanks for supporting the fight for a European Public Prosecutor 's Office in the Green Paper and countless hearings .
Unfortunately , we still do not really have a Community policy for European home affairs and justice .
The third pillar not only excludes Parliament from important areas of parliamentary codetermination and control , but is also the cause of many democratic deficits in European legal and justice policy .
The establishment of OLAF as a European fraud office without judicial accompaniment creates a legal vacuum at European level .
Once again , we have taken the second step before the first .
Unfortunately , the Convention does not really seem to be seeing how acute the problem is either .
What other explanation can there be for the fact that the Convention Presidium is again insisting on unanimity in the Council for a decision on establishing a European Public Prosecutor ?
The Council has shown in the past that it is not single minded in this and it has unfortunately also repeatedly shown that it is not always single minded in really working to prevent fraud and to protect the EU 's financial interests .
Let us therefore show great unity and a broad majority in Parliament today .
I believe we urgently need such a broad majority in order to demonstrate to the Convention Plenum in particular that we are against such unanimity and that we believe that the European Public Prosecutor 's Office must have a really important place in the new treaty , that the establishment of this Public Prosecutor 's Office must be decided by qualified majority and that here , too , Parliament must be given rights of codetermination .
Mr President , there cannot be anyone in the House who is not aware of the most important rule in politics : when you are in a hole , stop digging .
There is also the joke about the tourist who , lost in depths of Ireland , asked a local how to get to Tipperary and he was told ' I would not start from here ' .
Yet , lost at the bottom of the hole , starts Mrs Theato , who declares in her explanatory statement that ' it has long been acknowledged that the Communities ' financial interests require special protection under criminal law ' .
I agree , but if there were no Community funds , there would be no Community financial interests and , therefore , no need for their protection .
That is where I am coming from .
It has never made sense to hand over money to an organisation to spend in a manner that has evaded reform and which cannot be accounted for .
That is the ' hole ' .
The answer is to stop digging . Stop giving the Community money .
As for the creation of a European Prosecutor : that might be your desired destination , but my advice is that if I were you , I would not start from here .
The essentially corrupt and uncontrolled system is the problem .
Attack the cause , not the system .
Mr President , as a former occasional legal prosecutor myself , I find that the case for the European Public Prosecutor has been made far from effectively .
As a member of the European Convention , I think our job is to look for ways in which we do not add to institutional bureaucracy , but we try to simplify things so that the citizens of Europe are both protected and more in touch with those who represent them .
I cannot see the advantages of having this particular office even if , as one of my colleagues has just said , it is embedded in another institution .
There are difficulties in relation to cost and bureaucracy .
There are difficulties , as has been suggested , in relation to the fitting of this particular role into the legal systems of Europe , which are very different in their effect , in the evidence they collect and the nature of the prosecution process itself .
In my view , there is also a difficulty on the legal base .
In addition , if we are to allow the organisations presently in place to reform , this would not be helpful to them in the process .
What we need is more cooperation between States and the Commission - between authorities .
We need to clarify internal accounting arrangements and to give greater penalties to States which take inadequate approaches to fraud .
We need to encourage greater action by States and improve the role of the Court of Auditors .
We need more internal reforms .
The reform strategy of the EU has , in my view , stalled at the present time - it needs to be revived .
Frankly , there is no point in treating Member States of the EU as naughty children , taking their toys away from them and giving them to some over-worked and inadequate new minder .
If we respect our membership to the EU , we ought also to respect our ability to prosecute effectively and to deal with fraud and reform as necessary .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is absolutely undeniable that , when criminal fraud is being perpetrated and when the national authorities are failing to address the problems , the protection of the Community 's financial interests is not working or is working poorly , and that the present situation is unsustainable , as Mr B√∂sch recalled a short while ago with regard to the situation in Luxembourg .
Our rapporteur , Diemut Theato , has been tireless in calling for a European Public Prosecutor to be established in order to address this situation . Commissioner Schreyer has also given her unrelenting support to this initiative , and I therefore wish to congratulate both of them on their hard work and dedication .
Nevertheless , and with all the friendship , consideration and respect that I have for them , I must highlight two aspects of this matter that I believe are crucial .
I believe that European citizens would not understand our institutions resolving once again to consider only economic issues , ignoring the concept of citizenship .
I do not think it is acceptable to establish a European Prosecutor who looks after our financial interests but who ignores , for example , crimes involving the trafficking of human beings , particularly of children .
Furthermore , the number of European bodies working in the field of preventing , fighting and prosecuting crime , Europol , Eurojust and OLAF , and the complexity of defining the scope of each of these counsel caution in this field .
The worst situation we could face would be to increase the entropy of the system , with the various bodies being concerned only with their own competences , without the fight against economic crime on a European scale being pursued more effectively .
I wish to say a final word to express my reservations about the principles of the secrecy of justice and of the independence of the prosecutor 's office when adopted as absolute principles , as has happened , in the latter case , with the Commission Green Paper .
One only has to bear in mind the disappointing results achieved in my country in this field to understand the need not to make the same mistakes .
Mr President , I too , like Mr Kirkhope who took the floor a few moments ago , used to be a public prosecutor , but I reached and have again reached diametrically opposed conclusions .
I call on those who truly believe in European integration to be consistent and to support the plan for a stronger European Union , that is , which can avail itself of all the necessary means in order to exert real influence on the scourge of fraud prejudicial to the Union 's financial interests , since until now , these interests have not been adequately protected by the Member States with their laws .
It is a fact that each year the amount of fraud prejudicial to Community budgets - that is , in the final analysis , prejudicial to European taxpayers - amounts to approximately EUR one billion , as rightly stated by the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Theato - who has all my admiration and respect - and all the studies agree in saying that this phenomenon is set to steadily increase .
This is why the existing legal instruments to combat fraud such as the conventions and protocols ratified by the Member States , the cumbersome nature of actually putting into practice mutual assistance in criminal matters , the nature of OLAF which , under its mandate , has to restrict itself to mere administrative checks and , above all , the fragmentation of the European criminal law-enforcement area are totally insufficient to effectively fight this phenomenon , and the excuses which have been proffered until now do not convince me that we should abandon the European Public Prosecutor either .
The mere decision in principle is , however , not sufficient : if we really are in favour of establishing a European Public Prosecutor , we must be consistent in also providing him with the effective means to operate .
We must therefore define with the greatest precision , at Community level , the crimes and penalties stipulated for criminal acts and moreover , draw up common provisions in the field of European Union criminal law and criminal procedural law .
Consequently , I also believe , as the rapporteur Mrs Theato says , that in observing the separation of powers , the European Public Prosecutor and the deputy European prosecutors must be independent and carry out their mandate on the basis of the principle of mandatory prosecution .
Furthermore , it will be necessary to subject the European Public Prosecutor 's actions to judicial review , both with regard to investigations and to committals for trial .
In conclusion , honest citizens of the Union can only welcome the creation of an instrument which fights dishonest people at all times and in all areas .
Mr President , the discussion on the criminal-law protection of the EC 's financial interests has been dragging on for quite some time now .
A great deal of time and energy has been invested ; unfortunately , chiefly in using this deficiency to set up a European judiciary .
This report is based on political motives , as the previous speaker illustrated .
It is no wonder , then , that it arouses political opposition .
I regret that this is to the detriment of an objective discussion .
Where the report refers to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , it is running ahead of reality .
After all , the Charter has not yet been incorporated in the EU Treaty as legally binding .
Nor does my group wish it to be , in view of the mediocrity of its contents and the fact that it duplicates national constitutions and the European Convention on Human Rights .
If the resolution were really aimed at an effective criminal prosecution of fraud and criminal activity detrimental to the interests of the Community , it would have received our support .
This has proved impossible , however , now that this report has overreached itself and is aspiring after the European Union as a political entity .
Mr President , it appears that protection of the European Union 's financial interests is being taken as an excuse for the creation - and this seems to be the principle aim - of a super-prosecutor , which is virtually bound up with the establishment of the European arrest warrant , on a line seeking to replace national jurisdictions : a line on which the Italian Government has taken a stance of clear opposition , with precise explanations given on several occasions .
A proposal - for a European Public Prosecutor - which , as luck would have it , has been put forward again by the Praesidium of the Convention : Article 20 proclaims a European law creating a European Public Prosecutor 's office , whose structure should be decided by a majority vote .
This gives rise to further concerns , not least because very sensitive issues arise regarding the Prosecutor , such as the principle of the free movement of evidence , insofar as this means that the conditions for the admissibility of evidence specifically laid down in the legal system of the individual state in which judgment is to be passed will be glossed over .
Cross-border crime will not be tackled by destroying national legal traditions , but through appropriate controls and with efficient , effective measures to fight , prevent and eliminate international financial crime .
Mr President , I was pleased to hear that two days ago the Belgian authorities brought fraud charges against former Commissioner , Mrs Cresson , four years after her misdemeanours brought down the Santer Commission .
This , too , shows the urgent need to create a European Public Prosecutor to bring to court solely and exclusively cases of fraud involving European money , and to do so soon after the offence was committed , because a preventive effect can only be expected if prosecution and conviction follow quickly .
Although in principle I would be the last person to advocate a further transfer of powers to the EU , in this exceptional case it is justified because all - and I stress all - the bodies that have been responsible for the protection of European money up until now have failed lamentably , most of all the present Commission , which is being reduced by this task to throwing around verbal abuse .
The need for action is greater than ever , however , because the amount of fraud , mismanagement and nepotism is growing .
I need only mention the most recent goings on in the European Statistical Office , EUROSTAT .
For the most part , national public prosecutors cannot cope .
But hanging the small fry and letting the big fish get away is having a devastating effect on European citizens ' confidence in the European institutions .
I therefore appeal to the Council and the Convention : we do not need any more green papers .
What we need is a clear legal basis that clearly defines the task to be performed .
Then there will be no more room for objections from individual Member States .
This first step must be taken now with the revision of the treaties and eastwards enlargement .
If we succeed , this institution will be linked inseparably to Mrs Theato 's efforts , and I expressly thank her here once again for her persistent efforts .
Mr President , today we have an open market within the European Union , but that means that the market is also open to fraudsters .
Most of the fraud against the EU actually comes from money not collected .
The Commission has estimated that EUR 90 billion has been lost to the EU budget from cigarette smuggling alone .
We have some measures in place to stop fraud from occurring .
OLAF has been established , it does its job and passes on the file to the Member States - where it sits on a shelf .
We could sanction the Court of Auditors , but the question still has to be answered : who prosecutes ?
We could fraud-proof further but the question remains : who prosecutes ?
The establishment of Eurojust is there , but again : who prosecutes ?
The answer , which is factual rather than theoretical , is : almost nobody .
Member States are not serious about tackling fraud in the EU .
It took five years for them to ratify the Convention on the protection of financial interests .
Prosecution against people who rip off the EU is absolutely minimal .
The current system does not work .
It is extremely difficult to prosecute cross-border fraud , partly because evidence collected in one Member State does not count in another Member State .
What we have here on the table is a Green Paper . It is essential that the European Public Prosecutor 's powers are restricted to the financial interests of the EU budget .
Anything beyond that opens the door to massive complications and serious constitutional implications - which is why Paragraph 4 , which calls for a judicial area to be set up , is nonsense .
If the problem exists now , just imagine how difficult it will become following enlargement .
If we are serious about tackling fraud , we must accept that the current system does not work and until there is an acceptable alternative , we must go along with this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the circumstances of this debate are certainly not the best for expressing one 's thoughts .
On behalf of the Italian Radicals , we will continue to consistently oppose the bare idea of the creation of a European Public Prosecutor which is not accompanied by those instruments and those arrangements which form part of the legal and cultural heritage of our countries .
How can we possibly consider just a European Public Prosecutor without the judgment , appeal and defence mechanisms which are inherent and peculiar to each country 's legal system ?
Rushing headlong in this way can only make the structure that we are trying to give Europe even more justicialist and export a certain model of Italian justice with which we are all familiar and which has caused a great deal of harm in our country .
These are the reasons why we will be voting against the Theato report , having already voted against in committee , not because the idea per se is without foundation , but because it lacks all the attributes to make it effectively fair , as justice also at European level should be .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Theato on the report which I supported in the Committee on Budgetary Control and which I also expect to support in this plenum .
I would like to place the report within its context and point out that we are talking about establishing the European Parliament 's position in relation to the Commission 's Green Paper on the European financial prosecutor .
By means of this publication , the Commission intends to establish an extremely broad debate on all the issues relating to this figure and this has led it to include certain points which , if this were a legislative draft , would be considered crude , with gaps , and questionable in many respects .
The Green Paper , however , can be summed up in the idea , the intellectual hypothesis , that the defence of Community , and therefore cross-border , financial interests can perhaps be better defended by a figure also at Community level in this same field .
The rapporteur 's work is conditional upon this structure and therefore has to respond to the most significant issues in the Green Paper and also glean from that supplementary and premature information the essential notion , which is to achieve the legal basis necessary to continue a careful analysis .
There are two topical reasons why this treatment and the approval of this report are advisable .
On the one hand , the current Convention and the next intergovernmental conference which will establish the future of Community law and , on the other hand , the imminent incorporation of the new members which , on entering , should be faced with a legal basis which would allow them to be involved in the collective work of creating , when appropriate , the figure of European financial prosecutor .
Mr President , the Theato report on the Commission 's Green Paper on the protection of Community financial interests and on the creation of a European Public Prosecutor has had a lot of preparation and a long debate .
At the beginning , we agreed on this , provided that the office of Prosecutor remained , and still remains limited , precisely , to the financial interests of the Community .
During the debate and the assessments made by the Parliamentary committees however , the original measure was in danger of being distorted and taking on a different , dangerous form in the European institutional context .
This is why the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , early on , prepared a negative opinion but , subsequently , following intelligent steps by Mr Lehne and explanations from the Chairman , Mrs Theato , it set out a compromise opinion and tried to bring the institution which we want to regulate back towards the original suggestion .
Further discussions with Mrs Theato enabled us to reach a united , compromise position , which we hope will be endorsed in the Chamber this morning .
With great sensitivity , Mrs Theato took this issue on herself because , in actual fact , the European Union 's legal system does not provide for competences in the field of criminal law and criminal procedural law , or a judiciary endowed with all the degrees of adjudication able to guarantee the full right of defence .
In the absence of such conditions , the creation of an independent European Public Prosecutor without any controls would damage , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the already fragile interinstitutional balance between the Union and the States in an area as sensitive as justice : it would therefore be illogical and unjustified .
In particular , the creation of such a body would seem truly premature if we consider that we have not yet attained the objectives on judicial cooperation , let alone , where necessary , on the harmonisation of the rules on Member States ' criminal-law issues .
It is in the context of Eurojust - this certainly does have a subsidiarity problem and a major problem with coordinating the European States - and in this context alone that we can truly achieve a significant , uniform result which respects the States and at the same time provides the guarantees which the European Union must have .
This is how we are going to vote , and we will table these amendments to the Convention , which obviously cannot incorporate a European Prosecutor , an unrestricted super-prosecutor , which would run counter to all the guarantees which nevertheless exist in Europe .
Mr President , this morning the MEPs from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , when we looked in the postboxes here next to the Chamber , discovered a poster with our name and the word ' murderer ' .
I believe that until now , Mr President , only our colleagues in the Basque Country have been accustomed to this , to seeing their names on the targets painted in the street , and for some of them , Mr President , we have observed a minute 's silence here in this House .
I do not believe this is compatible with the spirit in which the European Union was founded , which is also incompatible ? and I say this respectfully - with certain posters which we saw yesterday here in the plenum .
I would therefore ask you , Mr President , to appeal for tolerance , which is the foundation of European integration .
The response of colleagues already speaks volumes on your appeal for tolerance .
Regarding the incident to which you refer , I condemn it totally .
Whoever did this has behaved in an unacceptable and disgraceful way .
A parliament is the tribune of the people and Members are fully entitled to express their policy analyses and preferences and to do so in serenity , in dignity and with respectful tolerance of each other .
In the light of what you have reported this morning , Mr Galeote Quecedo , I propose to ask the services whether we can discover how this incident happened and who perpetrated it , so that if possible we can learn a lesson from it .
If we need to make changes to the Rules to cope with disgraceful incidents of this sort , I am determined that we shall do so .
( Applause )
Mr President , I had requested the floor to condemn these intolerable actions and to express my solidarity with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and I wanted to make the proposal that you yourself have made .
I support it on behalf of my group .
There is absolutely no justification to be made for the disgraceful behaviour we have seen here today .
The next item is the vote .
Report ( A5-0045 / 2003 ) by Salvador Jov√© Peres , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a tuna tracking and verification system ( COM ( 2001 ) 406 - C5-0408 / 2001 - 2001 / 0170 ( CNS ) )
( Parliament adopted the text )
Report ( A5-0336 / 2002 ) by Gianfranco Dell 'Alba , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the proposal for amendment of the constituent acts of Community bodies following the adoption of the new Financial Regulation ( COM ( 2002 ) 406 )
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolutions , 1 to 12 )
Report ( A5-0077 / 2003 ) by Elmar Brok , on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and Terence Wynn , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets containing the European Parliament 's recommendations to the Council on the introduction in the draft Accession Treaty of a financial framework ( 2003 / 2050 ( INI ) )
Before the vote :
Mr President , I do not fully understand why we are going to vote without any explanations , since Mr Brok and Mr Wynn took part in a three-way dialogue this morning on behalf of the committees .
I think that Parliament should be given further information as to the results of this dialogue before taking a decision .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , regarding this morning 's negotiations I can inform you that there has been no agreement so far and the trialogue will continue next Tuesday .
I see prospects for agreement , but I also believe acceptance of this recommendation is also a decisive instrument guaranteeing our objectives in this matter , namely equality for Parliament and the candidate countries in the Budget procedure .
Please therefore take this as a speech in support of the resolution .
Mr President , in accordance with Rule 69 of our Rules of Procedure , the Commission can explain its position on Parliament 's amendments and , in the event that it does not accept all of those amendments , the rapporteurs - because I agree with my co-rapporteur , Mr Harbour , on this - would request a postponement of the vote on the legislative motion for a resolution , pursuant to Rule 69 ( 2 ) .


Mr President , could I first of all very briefly thank both Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega for their very hard and effective work in drawing up this report .
During the extensive debate on the report , and indeed during the useful and open debate on the oral question on pensions yesterday evening , I gave details of the many amendments which the Commission can readily accept and I also indicated those which we are not able to accept .
The amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission - there is not a very long list - are Amendments Nos 16 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 37 , 39 , 53 , 55 and 63 .
This is not a long list , easily available in translation in all languages !
I shall pay particular attention to the amendment on Members ' assistants , as it is a matter of concern in this House .
I can only repeat at this juncture that the Commission is aware of , and sympathetic to , the concerns that have been raised in Parliament .
I consequently hope that representations will eventually have the effect of resolving this important employment issue by breaking the interinstitutional deadlock in a positive way .
In postponing the vote on the legislative resolution , I understand that the House is seeking to provide itself with an opportunity to exert pressure on outstanding matters of concern at a later stage .
I hope I do not exceed my brief when I say that I urge the House to follow its intended course in a timely way .
I am absolutely certain that the rapporteurs fully comprehend the necessity of doing so .
I look forward to that final vote .
Mr President , as we have heard , thank heavens that there were only a few amendments the Commissioner could not accept !
In any event , I would ask , on my own behalf and on behalf of my co-rapporteur , Mr Harbour , that it be referred back to committee and I hope that we will soon be able to bring the legislative package back to Parliament .
- ( DA ) The June Movement is voting against establishing a tuna tracking and verification system .
The purpose of the proposal is to comply with international obligations under EU law , to which we strongly object .
It must however be emphasised that we are in favour of introducing arrangements for protecting dolphins and other threatened species . It is just that this must not be done under the auspices of the EU .
Each individual Member State should , as far as possible , endeavour , through international and regional cooperation , to promote the conservation and protection of threatened species .
Mr President , I can see male and female pensioners among the dense crowd of members of the public .
I was thinking precisely of them when I voted for the introduction in the Accession Treaty of a financial framework , because my personal aim and the aim of the Pensioners ' Party is to have safe pensions , which enable elderly people to live in dignity , also in the candidate countries .
I also hope to see an immediate increase in funding for the construction of infrastructure for industries , and consequently for the well-being of all the workers , unemployed and pensioners , including those in the other two candidate countries which are not going to enter the European Union in 2004 , that is , Romania and Bulgaria .
. ( PT ) I have welcomed and supported this outcome of the conciliation process .
I fully subscribe to the determination to improve the protection of the health and safety of consumers , preventing , which is what this new directive does , substances classified as carcinogens , mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction and preparations containing these substances from being marketed for the use of the general public .
In fact , as we know , ' marketing ' implies greater responsibility for ensuring that the product in question will fulfil the purposes for which it is intended without compromising public health and safety ( of persons and goods ) .
This is a term that gives the general public the feeling that certain products are ' trustworthy ' .
This trust must therefore be matched both by the provision for and listing of these products or substances - a measure proposed by the Commission , which I welcome - bearing in mind that the new EU strategy on chemical products will involve the registration of around 30 000 substances - and by a preliminary evaluation of the risks inherent in each substance .
In fact , the monitoring , registration and handling of chemical products and substances must be covered by a set of rules that is clear , easy to understand and appropriate to the purposes for which the use of such products is intended .
Mr President , as this report explains , cement used in construction contains chromium IV which causes occupational diseases - known to all bricklayers - referred to as cement dermatitis .
I therefore could not fail to vote for this directive which limits and seeks to reduce the danger of the work of bricklayers who build what surrounds us .
As representative of the Pensioners ' Party I would like , however , to urge a directive to be adopted in Europe which reduces working hours - for harmful working activities such as bricklayers ' work - so that we have fewer occupational diseases .
. ( PT ) Although I understand the need to apply the precautionary principle so as to reduce the risks inherent in contact by chromium with the skin of civil construction and cement industry workers , it is my view that this proposal for a directive does not provide the best assurance of this .
First of all because sufficient account has not been taken of the results of the previous regulation ( 2001 / 60 EC ) .
Secondly , because it is not based on harmonised methods for determining chromium levels , which could consequently lead to distortions of competition and to reducing safeguards for workers .
Thirdly , because it establishes an unacceptable derogation for unbagged cement .
We know that a lack of objectivity in applying the precautionary principle has led to countless cases of non-compliance .
My fear is that this will also happen with this regulation .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur .
We have long argued for the development of research in clinical methods in the fight against HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries .
Much of the hope of the impoverished third world - currently the portion of the globe suffering under the heaviest burdens of death and misery from HIV / AIDS , malaria and TB - is vested in our ability to offer funding for research and medicines that are effective , easy to use and affordable .
I particularly welcome the fact that up to EUR 600 million will be made available for the fight against these diseases , of which the EU will contribute up to EUR 200 million .
It is important to recognise , however , that while this is a very welcome step , it is a small amount compared with the cost to the world if these diseases are left unchecked .
Mr President , I see that my previous explanations of vote have been heeded in the drawing up of this provision .
On other occasions , I have called for the funds spent on scientific research by each of the 15 Member States to be combined in order to avoid money being wasted and so that more can be used to make rapid scientific discoveries which will benefit all Europeans .
With this decision , EUR 200 million provided by the Member States is combined with EUR 200 million provided by the European Union and EUR 200 million provided by the private sector to fund research which will allow us to find more effective treatments for AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria .
I therefore voted for the Cauldron report with great pleasure .
. ( PT ) Our commitment to combating transmissible diseases , with particular focus on poverty-related diseases , such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , and on improving vaccination and healthcare levels by the more developed countries funding health programmes , by removing barriers of access ( licences and patents ) to pharmaceutical products faced by developing countries and the barriers faced by international partnerships in developing new generations of products is crucial .
I must once again point out that 70 % of those infected with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa and that AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria account for 5 million deaths per year .
I therefore welcome the EU 's proposal to participate in research programmes for new clinical interventions for combating HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis .
This participation cannot , however , replace the EU 's financial commitments to combating these diseases .
I congratulate Mr Caudron on his good work .
. ( PT ) I approve of Parliament 's proposal and amendments because I believe that these improve an important Commission proposal , establishing a viable and timely response for resolving a serious and universal problem : a long-term research programme intended to boost new clinical interventions to combat poverty-related diseases in developing countries .
I also support the report because it refers to a Commission proposal in which financial contributions converge from sources as diverse as the EU , national research programmes within the various participating States and from the private sector , involving the affected countries themselves in the programme .
The exponential increase in the sums involved in this programme in comparison with the previous programme , together with the ongoing concern to make the results of research genuinely accessible to the populations of developing countries , is making it more likely that the programmes will be effective .
I wish to note , however , that also because of the sums involved , this form of European cooperation requires the implementation of Community funds to be closely monitored .
. ( PT ) The gravity of the epidemics of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis and the need to increase levels of aid at national , regional and world level are undeniable .
Millions of people are dying every year in the poorest countries .
I fully agree with developing this programme in its various closely linked and interdependent strands : promoting prevention , encouraging treatment and making essential medicinal products more affordable , and stepping up research and development .
Regarding the Attwooll report on shark finning ( A5-0043 / 2003 ) I voted against Amendment No 13 which allows for shark fins and body parts to be landed separately .
The procedure renders futile attempts to monitor the numbers of sharks being caught .
That the Commission and the Council will determine the final shape of the regulation should be a consolation .
But sadly this is not the case .
The proposed regulation originated with a petition presented to Environment Commissioner Wallstr√∂m by the Shark Trust , and with a question I tabled in the Environment Committee .
I feel sure that Commissioner Wallstr√∂m will feel let down by DG Fisheries .
That an official from this DG 's Conservation Unit can dismiss the concerns with the words ' I must trust much more the opinion of our fishing industry if it is for them to obtain good returns from their landings ' suggests to me that he has a strange idea of conservation .
Perhaps Commissioner Fischler should put him in charge of inspecting abattoirs .
European citizens seeking to protect fish species from extinction can have no confidence in a Commission DG which seems to have sold its soul to serve the interests of the Spanish fishing industry .
. ( PT ) I have voted in favour of this report .
Whilst respecting the personal taste and the gastronomic heritage of certain communities and ethnic groups , and I do , of course , respect these , there are nevertheless minimum requirements for catching and preparing the species intended to satisfy these appetites and tastes .
The practice of removing sharks ' fins and throwing the rest of the body into the sea , sometimes while the animal is still alive , is considered to be a threat to the survival of some species of shark and , furthermore , lays itself open to a charge of barbarity , which is entirely incompatible with the principles and declarations that have been upheld throughout the process of European integration .
The report presented by Elspeth Attwooll ( ELDR , UK ) , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , welcoming the Commission 's proposal for a regulation intended to prohibit this practice therefore warrants my full support .

Mr President , Amendment No 2 to recital 2 ( b ) of the report by Mr Harbour and Mr Medina Ortega abolishes the weighting of pensions according to the pensioner 's place of residence , so that equal pensions are paid out for equal contributions .
This is a sound economic principle which I would like to see applied throughout Europe .
As we know , I regret to say that there are citizens in some states , not least Italy , who have not paid any contributions and yet receive the same sized pension as citizens who have paid a lot of contributions .
All 15 Member States should follow Europe 's example !
With the proposal to reform Staff Regulations , the European Union is being called on to apply internally the general choices made by big business , as it promotes cutbacks in public services and attacks workers ' rights .
Efforts to reduce wages and benefits , impose new taxes and drastically reduce pensions and pension rights are all part of the attack on workers ' rights .
The abolition of services and greater favouritism and dependence are being promoted within a framework of cutbacks in the role of public services and a more vigorous , peculiar sort of patronage which will serve the interests of lobbies , large companies and strong political families .
The majority of employees and the trades union of the various institutions of the European Union oppose Mr Kinnock 's proposal .
But , Mr Kinnock is using the usual tricks , with the connivance of certain trades union leaders , in an effort to strike the European public service a decisive blow and set an example for national public administrations .
We support the just demands of the workers and their movement .
We consider that the European Parliament should stand by the view that this matter requires the codecision procedure and should not allow the Commission and the Council to take decisions without any form of control on a matter which , moreover , also affects the smooth running of Parliament .
We voted against Amendment No 64 , even though it seeks to create a ' less unequal ' system for the employees of the Parliament .
Generally we want the staff to have equal rights regarding salary , thus we could have voted in favour of the amendment , if the 16 % was given to all new members of staff regardless of origin .
- ( DA ) We are voting against the amendment because we are opposed in principle to the expatriation allowance 's not being given to all employees on the grounds that it is not given to employees resident in Belgium at the start of their employment .
We agree with the content of Amendment No 64 and would have voted in favour of it if it had meant the expatriation allowance 's being granted to all employees .
Mr President , I have to admit that I had a little nap during the votes , and , while I was asleep , I saw the 15 Heads of State , meeting in Brussels for this European Council , having an animated discussion .
One of them said to the others : ' In order to balance the pensions accounts , you should do as we used to do in Italy and still do today .
In Italy , when we select the Finance Minister , we give him a medical examination .
We x-ray his chest to see if he has a heart of stone .
We test his eyes to see if he has square pupils for squaring the accounts . Then we carry out a blood test to see if he has a high resistance to alcohol because , in some governmental circles , a toast is drunk every time a pensioner dies .
We selected our Finance Minister in this way and so we do not have to worry .
You should do as we have done ! '
. ( FR ) The Brussels Council removed from its agenda the speech by Val√©ry Giscard d 'Estaing , President of the Convention , on the basis that the subject of Iraq required more urgent attention .
In fact , however , the Council hardly discussed Iraq either , in order to avoid exacerbating the existing division .
We might well ask ourselves whether the postponement of the speech by the President of the Convention could be indicative of deep unrest , for two reasons .
The first , of course , concerns the Iraq crisis , which shows that a unified foreign policy is impossible and which will probably lead to the formation of at least two Europes , with either a vertical or horizontal split .
This possibility , however , is not currently part of the Convention 's plans , which are still mainly along the lines of the united model .
The second reason relates to the presence , or absence , of the candidate countries at Council meetings .
It is true that they are not yet Members , but is it possible to discuss the Convention without them ?
If so , should it not be clearly stated that they will be full signatories to the future , so-called ' constitutional ' Treaty , in other words , that this Treaty can only be concluded after 1 May 2004 , when they have become Members ?
That is our position .
. ( ES ) The increasingly open and competitive economic environment in which the business world has to operate these days and the need to promote a form of economic growth capable of guaranteeing the employment and social well-being of the citizens , fully justifies the strategy and the agreements adopted by the European Council to provide that strategy with new impetus .
These agreements should have been much more ambitious in terms of their proposed scope and the fields covered , in view of the accumulated delays in the implementation of the measures agreed in Lisbon .
So I have voted in favour of the resolution , but I regret that it does not include a reference to the need to guarantee access to third-country markets on a reciprocal basis and with full respect for the rules governing international trade , an aspect which I believe to be essential .
In terms of maintaining and improving employment , the measures will be of little use , however necessary they are , if our companies are not able to export as a result of the unfair competition in the field of external trade which the EU is obliged to control .
. ( EL ) The Brussels Summit did not say a single word in even mild condemnation of this crime against the Iraqi people .
It only turned its attention to the imperialist war in order to express its fear that it might cause big business 's profits to fall and to propose preventive measures to escalate its anti-grass roots attack .
In the name of the misleadingly titled , anti-grass roots ' Lisbon objectives ' , it decided to promote measures and policies , in the name of competitiveness and entrepreneurship , which undermine employment , social , insurance and pension rights .
Guidelines were issued for extending and broadening part-time and temporary employment , agency systems and flexible employment relations , basically abolishing collective agreements , cutting social spending back even further , handing the wealth of the people over to private capital , ' liberalising ' public-sector and public utility services and encouraging health and health care to be turned into commodities and insurance systems to be privatised .
They are , of course , deluding themselves if they think that the workers will be distracted by false promises and PR tricks .
It is they who feel the pinch of recession , constantly eroded incomes and falling living standards .
They are organising and stepping up their fight against the choices being made by big business and the European Union .
Increasingly radical grass-roots rallies are springing up and the wave of opposition to the cruelties of capitalism is swelling in every Member State of the European Union .
. ( PT ) The environmental dimension has still not been sufficiently integrated into the Lisbon strategy .
I therefore feel that both the European Commission and the Member States must ensure that , before the 2004 Spring Summit , three objectives are fulfilled : first of all , extending the list of structural indicators that serves as a basis for evaluating the performance of Member States , including new environmental indicators that evaluate the European situation in areas such as water resources , biodiversity , soil degradation , chemical pollution and food safety .
Secondly , the European Strategy for Sustainable Development must be updated in light of the commitments given at the Johannesburg Conference and monitoring mechanisms must be established to evaluate the European Union 's compliance with worldwide targets .
Thirdly , also where the environment is concerned , the Lisbon strategy must provide for a genuine plan of action , including policies , targets and timetables for implementation .
Many of these targets have been debated on various occasions at European summits but have ultimately fallen by the wayside .
It is now time to include them in the Lisbon strategy .
Which way did I vote on the extremely serious issue of Iraq ?
Well , Mr President , I slept very well last night and , once again , I had a dream .
There was a boxing ring . The two boxers were President George W. Bush and President Saddam Hussein .
The referee was the Secretary-General of the UN , Kofi Annan . Miss Europe , dressed in a miniskirt , was the ring girl , holding a board bearing the words ' First round ' .
George Bush was immediately knocked to the floor by Saddam Hussein and lost the round amid applause from all the pacifists in the world .
When I saw George Bush lying on the ground , I was moved to pity and I decided to rush to the aid of the cowboy and vote for our support to be expressed to the United States of America , which has saved Europe from dictators in the past .
Mr President , I regret that this House has been unable to adopt a clear position on Iraq .
I would therefore like to state my position for the record . I consider this war to be illegal , immoral and politically counterproductive .
I also believe that we must use the current crisis in foreign and security policy to unite Europe in foreign and security policy , not against the USA but as a self-assured partner ; sadly we are still not that today , and it is our own fault .
Mr President , it is with great regret , not to say anguish , that I see the outcome of the vote on the motion today in this House .
It is tragic to see that , like the Council , Parliament too has decided not to speak out .
The deserted Chamber is , at this moment , the tragic symbol of our behaviour in this international crisis which is proving so terrible .
This sign of impotence can only be a cause of pain to all those who have always hoped and continue to hope that Europe will be to the world a shining example of balance , progress , peace and guaranteeing respect for the rights of peoples and international law .
Despite the fact that no resolution has been adopted , there were significant votes , the most important of which would appear to be that in which Parliament opted by a large majority for a common foreign and security policy with areas of enhanced cooperation .
This is the only glimmer of hope in the despair which follows a vote which does us no credit .
Mr President , the positions I have adopted on today 's votes on the crisis over Iraq have all been underpinned by an undeniable principle of solidarity .
Now that war has begun , this should be a time for unity , whether or not one agrees with the war .
When one of the Member States , the United Kingdom , is at war , our duty is to stand shoulder to shoulder with it .
When any of our allies in the Atlantic Alliance calls for our solidarity , we must stand shoulder to shoulder with them , especially during the most difficult times , so that we can count on them in the event that our own security is called into question .
Those who take the view that Resolution 1441 is inadequate should remember the 16 previous resolutions and the around 7 000 inspectors who in the last twelve years have spent almost seven years inspecting , without any visible results .
Those who still prefer inspections to continue , using the rhetorical threat of the use of force , should remember that the disunity of the international community revealed in the UN Security Council has been the most lethal weapon ever given to Saddam Hussein .
To those who , albeit entirely legitimately , are solely concerned with the humanitarian consequences of an armed conflict - and we are all concerned - I would say that we are opposing the harsh reality of the Iraqi people , who for decades have been subjected to a continual and silent ethnic cleansing and to the devastating consequences of a despotic , cruel and unpredictable dictatorship .
We all want peace , as quickly as possible , but the peace that I want to see is a secure peace , without the threats of terrorism or of the use of weapons of mass destruction , a peace that entails freedom not only for us but also for the Iraqis , as well as prosperity that is properly shared with those who need it most .
. ( EL ) The Greek Presidency of the Council maintains that it is making a quantum leap forward in order to overcome major differences within the European Union over Iraq .
It forgets the innocent victims in Baghdad , the inexorable siege of Basra and the rivers of blood , and talks instead about who will rule Iraq after the war , the USA or the UN .
In fact this is a step backwards , to the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century , when France , Britain and Spain quarrelled and haggled over who would control Morocco , Libya and Egypt .
The European Union must not shy away from what is happening ; it must call for this illegal war to stop , in accordance with Article 11 of the Treaties requiring its foreign policy to be in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter , and it must condemn the British Government .
Tony Blair , of course , is preparing to come to Athens in a few days ' time , for the signing of the Treaty by the 10 new Member States on 16 April .
He would do better to stay away .
For the Greek people he is persona non grata .
If he does come , if the bloodstained invader of Iraq sets foot on the Greek soil of freedom , he may be sure that he will never forget the reception which the Greek people have in store for him , a peaceful reception of course , but with flag-waving and voices raised in song .
. ( EL ) Regardless of the fact that the European Parliament was unable in the end to pass a resolution on Iraq , the way in which the majority of MEPs voted on the individual amendments is indicative of how it is dealing with this new demonstration of imperialist barbarity .
All the amendments condemning the war as unjust and illegal and calling on the Member States not to provide facilities to the invaders were rejected .
In an unprecedented distortion of the truth , the majority of members even voted against amendments which simply stated the obvious , that this war is being waged without the backing of the UN , is opposed by most members of the Security Council and has incited millions of people to take to the streets in daily protest .
By contrast , the amendments adopted prove that all the European Parliament is interested in is the so-called ' reconstruction ' of Iraq , for which read the sharing out of the spoils , and further militarization of the ? U by strengthening the CSDP .
It seems to us that the more the American and British imperialists stain their hands with the blood of the Iraqi people , the further the masks of the so-called moderate European imperialists will drop .
The only opponent able to put an end to the war and overturn the powers supporting it is the anti-imperialist , grass-roots movement .
I wish to record my absolute abhorrence of the war against Iraq , which is in breach of international law and natural justice .
Unilateral action by the US and UK Governments endangers world peace , regional stability and undermines the authority of the United Nations .
I am deeply disappointed at some Member States and applicant countries who give military support to the conflict .
I am further disappointed at the hypocritical stance adopted by the Irish Government .
It parades a fictitious commitment to neutrality while allowing US army planes to use Shannon airport despite the clear condemnation by the Irish people of the action in which these planes are engaged .
I call on Parliament to demand the immediate end of this illegal war .
Parliament should call upon the United Nations Security Council to be convened , to take control of the situation and to mandate the Secretary-General to initiate steps to stop the war .
The United Nations Security Council should also authorise the deployment of UN human rights monitors throughout Iraq .
Iraqi and Kurdish authorities should provide the monitors with full access and cooperation to protect the Iraqi population , including the Kurdish population of northern Iraq , now potentially at risk of attack from Turkey .
. ( PT ) Despite the humanitarian tragedy that the war against Iraq is causing , the majority of the European Parliament has unfortunately not adopted proposals by our group that sought to condemn this unjust , illegitimate and illegal war , which has been decided on unilaterally , in total breach of international law and against the majority opinion of the peoples of the entire world .
The proposals that called for an end to the bombardments and for a return to international legality were also rejected , as were those suggesting that the war now underway is a disaster for the region as a whole and for the entire world because it constitutes a threat to international security and runs the risk of creating permanent instability in the region , of causing the fragmentation of Iraq and of heightening tension , also leading to the resurgence of terrorism .
Consequently , so little remained that it would be preferable to maintain the position adopted on 30 January , in which the majority of Members of the European Parliament affirmed their commitment to the United Nations ' remaining at the centre of the world order and roundly condemned a unilateral war .
We shall continue to fight against war , and to ensure its immediate cessation for the sake of peace .
I had hoped the European Parliament would do its job to bridge differences between our countries at this time of international crisis , and like every rational member in this Chamber I believe everything possible must be done to avoid war whenever possible .
However , when an amendment passed which specifically condemned the decision to take military action which has already started , and which involves some of our own countries , I found it impossible to give my support .
MEPs should instead have looked forward to our joint task to seek the swiftest possible end to conflict with the minimum of casualties , to humanitarian assistance for the Iraqi people and to plans for the rebuilding of the country under the firm auspices of the United Nations .
Europe will not truly influence America or world affairs unless we are able to resolve our differences and speak with a common voice .
That is the lesson to be learnt from today 's failure to find an acceptable common resolution .
We voted against the joint resolution presented by the Verts / ALE , PSE and ELDR Groups , for the simple reason that as Baghdad is being destroyed by bombs , there is a complete lack of condemnation of US-UK belligerence .
Instead , the resolution levels the bulk of its criticism at Iraq and bemoans the tension with the US .
For example , it considers that the belligerent countries should not use disproportionate force that could injure large numbers of civilians .
As if this war , intended by the imperialist US to ensure control of Iraqi oil , was ever going to be a ' clean ' war .
The official number of civilian deaths during this first week reminds us that this is not the case .
The drama being played out in the Middle East deserves more than hypocrisy or pious hopes .
We are amazed to see that a resolution of this kind could be proposed by parties which have so far opposed this unjust , illegal , illegitimate war and which take part in anti-war protests .
Our attitude remains the same , whether in the Chamber of the European Parliament or in the street .
The tens of millions of people who have demonstrated all over the world in the past few weeks and who will take to the streets again on Saturday 29 March are showing the way to stop this war
- ( NL ) For a year and a half we have known that President Bush of the United States wanted war .
Now that war is a reality , many politicians seem to have forgotten their objections .
They deplore the fact that the United States is acting outside the UN , but now want to show that they have remained friends .
The focus of attention has shifted to the redevelopment of a common foreign policy in the EU and common military action .
People no longer want to talk about the disaster for the Iraqi population , which has already suffered many years of war , isolation and sanctions , but rather about post-war reconstruction .
Of course , no one need shed any tears if the brutal dictator Saddam is removed , something which might have succeeded much earlier if Europe , the United States and Russia had not supplied him with weapons .
We do not know whether his successor will be any better for the Iraqi people , but he will certainly be better for the supply of oil to the United States .
The Kurds want their freedom , but the chance of breaking away from Iraq will not come from the United States .
I am afraid that the only result of any US victory will be that the US Government will wage war more often against regimes it considers hostile .
That is why this war must be stopped before it is too late .
The majority that rejects stopping it becomes an accessory .
Their best-case scenario now is that no judgment be passed .
. ( IT ) The European Parliament cannot , on the tragedy of Iraq and the Middle East , continue to be divided and present different positions for ideological and exploitative reasons .
Many points in a number of resolutions tabled preserve the discrepancy between what is a partisan position and what ought to be a political message seeking to further peace , the elimination of a bloody dictatorship and reconstruction , under the auspices of the UN .
To this end , we should start to concentrate as of now on relieving the suffering of children and the oldest citizens .
We must , once more , condemn the subversive attitude of those who persist , whatever the situation , in feeling that they must first and foremost represent their own political faction and who , for reasons of party politics , prevent the achievement of common positions .
In a debate yesterday on the situation in Iraq , a deeply respected French colleague said that it was hardly the time to lay blame when men , women and children were dying in this tragic war .
It is time to focus on the humanitarian needs of this long-suffering people and on the reconstruction of this beautiful country .
We must commit to giving our utmost support , financial and otherwise , to achieve this .
In so doing , we must ensure that we show the deepest respect to the different religious traditions in this country and to this ancient civilisation which has contributed so much to the world .
Words alone may contribute little to the resolution of this conflict .
For those of us who feel forced to stand and watch helplessly , Pope John Paul II , one of the world 's greatest leaders , who has consistently reached out to the Muslim community , has asked us to fast and pray for a speedy end to this war .
. ( PT ) I have abstained from voting because the resolution that has been tabled is not as decisive as it could be with regard to the US position on the practice of preventive attacks .
I wish to emphasise the solidarity that we must show towards the Iraqi people and to the relatives of the young American and British soldiers who have died in this unjust war .
Mr President , I welcome a tough policy to restrict the use of pesticides .
According to the World Health Organisation , they are responsible for large numbers of cases of illness and even death worldwide each year , and their use has steadily risen .
This legislation will reduce the risk to human health and the environment posed by pesticides and is aimed at halving the quantities used within a decade .
This can only be achieved by creating a framework for taxes and other levies on pesticides and I support the plan to stop Member States from reducing VAT on pesticides .
Producers or importers should assume responsibility for the recovery and safe disposal of all pesticide packaging and pesticides past their expiry date and revoked pesticides products .
Reducing the levels of harmful active substances and in particular replacing the most dangerous by safer , non-chemical alternatives and encouraging pesticide-free crop farming are aims I very much welcome .
Mr President , it is , of course , a good thing that Europe is attempting to limit the harmful products which are used in farming to kill parasites and make fruit , vegetables and all agricultural produce as healthy as possible and to grow them in the greatest possible quantities .
However , I ask myself - and I wonder whether you might be asking yourself the same thing , Mr President , and whether the Greens , above all , might be asking themselves - why we do not increase research and scientific activities to create genetically modified organisms , GMOs , in agriculture to produce large quantities of high quality plants , fruit and agricultural produce which are resistant to parasites , which would therefore remove the need for genuinely harmful pesticides .
- ( DA ) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Van Brempt 's report but believe it to be crucial to draw attention to the fact that the use of pesticides can never be regarded as a sustainable alternative , irrespective of whether there is a reduction in their use .
Instead , the sustainable use of pesticides gives the green light to the spreading of poison .
We have the following comments on the actual proposal .
The limit value should relate to a variety of different pesticides , plus their breakdown products .
The proceeds from fees should , most importantly , be used for clearing up in accordance with the ' polluter pays ' principle .
If pesticides are used at any stage at all in the production process , the final product should be labelled to that effect .
Finally , it should always be possible for a country to pioneer the right to maintain and introduce bans on the use of pesticides , partly on the basis of a national assessment in terms of the precautionary principle .
The basic aim of the strategy is to reduce the impacts of pesticides on human health and the environment .
Pesticides are expensive commodities and farmers only use them where necessary .
We must not overlook the fact that pesticides play an important role in modern agriculture : using pesticides efficiently can increase crop yields and help maintain high standards of food quality and safety .
Pesticides play an important role in these elements demanded by European consumers .
The suggestion to reduce pesticide use by 50 % is not predicated upon any scientific data .
It is a figure drawn from thin air which somehow gives the impression that pesticide use is inherently bad .
This is clearly not the case .
Minimising risks can best be achieved by improving controls on the distribution and use of pesticides , as well as substituting the more dangerous substances with safer alternatives .
Education and training programmes also play an important role in introducing alternative cultivation practices .
And indeed , there is certainly potential for using CAP pillar II funds to this end .
We also need to remember that a regulatory framework for marketing and using plant protection products already exists under EU law .
Any future strategy must remain compatible with the existing framework .
. ( PT ) Agriculture in the European Union is increasingly dependent on pesticides ( 327 000 tonnes in 1999 ) .
Although we understand the importance of these substances in controlling pests , the fact is that alternatives do exist , particularly in organic farming .
Although it is believed that there can be no profitable agriculture without the intensive use of pesticides , this is only true if the environmental cost of all products is included in their final price .
Pesticides , however , entail enormous costs to the environment , such as the contamination of groundwater and the loss of biodiversity and costs to human health , such as endocrine disruption , infertility and cancer .
It is worth recalling that , according to the WHO , every year pesticides cause disease in 3 million people and the deaths of 220 000 throughout the world .
I therefore welcome this Communication by the European Commission and the report by Mrs Van Brempt , intended to ensure that European legislation on the use of pesticides is revised .
In this future legislation it is crucial that targets are defined , as well as timetables and means to ensure compliance with the objective of achieving a 50 % reduction in the use of pesticides in the EU by 2010 .
- ( DA ) We are voting in favour of the resolution despite the fact that we do not in principle believe that this is an EU concern .
Since the limits already lie within the EU and it is a question of amending already existing regulations , we shall
