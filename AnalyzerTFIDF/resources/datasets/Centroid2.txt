  i’m outraged and i think you will be too  just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slow acting poison spread in fields miles away  and who plans to commit such a mass bird killing  the u s department of agriculture  in fact the usda has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern great plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly    other bird species  it’s almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like ddt have had on wildlife and people  thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring but the usda’s plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration unless we act now  let me tell you exactly what’s at stake and how this could set a dangerous precedent first of all you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the migratory bird treaty act’s prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm  you see the usda found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities  so they applied for the right to spread poison as dart of a “scientific experiment” to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss  can you believe it the usda wants to conduct an “experiment” that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds  and if the death of two million birds doesn’t “prove” their theory and show a reduction in crop loss they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year  it’s time to tell the usda in no uncertain terms  “you will not conduct massive bird kills  to benefit a handful of special interests ”  because the usda’s slow acting pesticide takes three days to kill its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields before falling to the ground  meanwhile blackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison we’ve noted the presence of    other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison baited areas including the bobolink grasshopper sparrow harris’ sparrow and le conte’s sparrow  in all nine birds on the federal threatened or endangered lists and    birds on audubon’s watchlist of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields  we simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife  here’s what i need you to do to make sure we prevail first i need you to sign and return your petition to the u s secretary of agriculture  i’ll forward your petition along with those from thousands of other audubon members and supporters urging the usda to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds in favor of alternative benign methods of protecting sunflower crops  i can assure you that thousands of audubon petitions can make a difference just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago  but today’s battle is one we must win to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase    years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment  that’s why i hope you’ll also agree to help even more by making a tax deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of audubon’s vital conservation work to protect birds other wildlife and habitat and with a donation of    or more you’ll receive a free birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern  i’ll make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to  ·win a ban on the usda bird poisoning  ·gain strict enforcement of wildlife laws  ·ensure wildlife programs are based on sound science  ·monitor the health of audubon’s watchlist species  ·conserve america’s remaining grassland habitat  and audubon will draw upon its century long track record of highly effective conservation work to make a real difference in other key areas  audubon protects birds your help will be instrumental to our bird conservation work designating important bird areas to protect vital habitat maintaining the watchlist of bird species near endangered status www audubon org bird watch and engaging citizen participation in the vast birdsource database of north american bird trends  audubon rescues endangered wildlife nearly    years ago the national audubon society helped win passage of the endangered species act with your help audubon will remain committed to wildlife laws and regulations that are well funded properly implemented and strongly enforced  audubon establishes and protects wildlife refuges and sanctuaries “audubon is truly making a difference for wildlife refuges everywhere” says u s fish and wildlife official rick coleman and your support will help sustain our innovative audubon refuge keepers program and maintain our own network of more than     wildlife centers and sanctuaries  audubon restores wetlands wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife they also help purify our drinking water and prevent billions of dollars worth of flood damage your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore one million acres of irreplaceable wetlands  audubon educates the public teaching americans particularly young people how to become better stewards of our environment is one of the best investments that you and i can make for wildlife that’s why we’re expanding our network of audubon centers to reach children and adults in every corner of the nation  and of course your support will enable audubon to stand ready to act whenever a wildlife crisis emerges  like the usda’s bird poisoning proposal that i’m asking you to help us defeat today  so let me urge you to do your part by supporting a group that the san francisco chronicle calls “one of america’s most respected and influential conservation organizations  first sign and return your petition to the secretary of agriculture immediately to declare a firm and resounding “no ” to the usda’s bird poisoning plan  and i also hope you’ll take a second important step today by supporting audubon’s vital conservation work with a generous tax deductible gift thank you  very truly yours  john flicker  president  p s your gift will help us save birds other wildlife and their habitat for future generations to cherish and in thanks for your gift of    or more you    receive a free birdfeeder supplies are limited so please respond today 
  alaska emergency  dear defender  look closely at this photo and you’ll see a wolf running soon this wolf won’t be merely running in the snow  this wolf will be running for its life  the airplane above will be tracking her in order to land and immediately gun her down  you see the alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a    trapping or    hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down this cruel unethical wolf hunting practice is called “same day airborne land and shoot ”  it was a total shock and surprise  in may the alaska legislature voted to reinstate same day airborne wolf killing frankly we never thought alaska’s anti wolf politicians would go this far but they did overriding governor tony knowles’ veto — and ignoring the will of the majority of alaska’s citizens  unfortunately this practice will begin after the first snow this september when wolves will be “can’t miss” targets against alaska’s snowy terrain wolves can run fast — but they certainly can’t outrun airplanes  given the urgency of the situation in alaska defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save alaska’s wolves from same day airborne land and shoot slaughter  support the emergency effort to save alaska’s wolves  defenders hopes to raise at least         to help alaskans for wildlife a coalition of alaska citizens win a citizens’ ballot initiative this november and we face very wealthy opponents so today i urge you to do these two things  first sign the enclosed citizens’ advisory ballot to show our alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on “same day airborne  land and shoot” wolf killing in alaska  second rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in november  the alaska legislature is completely out of step with the will of alaska’s citizens and the american public at large  like you the majority of alaskans oppose same day land and shoot wolf killing but the anti wolf politicians in the alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of alaska citizens want and they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the alaska department of fish and game which opposed this legislation  they are utterly out of step with their alaska constituents the state agency that manages alaska wildlife and the rest of the american public  in the name of “wolf control ” wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion so that the wolves have literally no chance of survival  and if history is any guide over the years thousands of alaska’s wolves will be brutally killed  before the      ban on same day land and shoot as many as     wolves were killed in alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice  anti wolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new land and shoot law stands — even though most alaskans do not support it  so if we don’t act right now alaska’s snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in america’s “last frontier ”  say “no” to the barbaric practice of same day airborne wolf killing  the only way alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on same day airborne land and shoot wolf killing is with a citizens’ referendum  that’s why your special financial support is so important — and urgently needed  alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves  as i mentioned this new same day airborne land and shoot practice will start in september after the opening of hunting season and the first snow — and when wolves will be an easy target  to repeal this unconscionable law defenders must help provide our friends in alaska alaskans for wildlife — with the resources necessary to win at the polls in november  our well funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure we need help to supplement the funds raised by alaskans for wildlife for careful polling the development of voter education spots for television radio and newspapers the placement of those ads and “get out the vote” efforts on election day  if alaska’s new law is not replaced thousands of alaska s wolves will die in the years to come  and it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide — at a time when the american public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection a loss will encourage those anti wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild  so please don’t wait another minute  please sign your citizens’ advisory ballot to demonstrate to our alaska allies that you’re behind them and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort  so how will your money be spent  here’s the projected budget breakdown         — in depth state wide survey conducted by a top pollster to determine voters’ positions on the ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecided voters         — salaries office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day         — production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey          — placement of voter education spots in the key media including print radio and television money must be in hand by mid august to reserve time for september and october         — election day “get out the vote” drive including phone calls to get voters to the polls  you stood by defenders when we defeated the wealthy american farm bureau in court and saved the lives of the wolves in yellowstone national park and central idaho  now i’m hoping i can count on your moral and financial support again today to help save alaska’s wolves from same day airborne land and shoot killing  your special donation today is absolutely critical because many of alaska’s politicians clearly have anti wolf agendas they have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of alaska and the american public  please let alaskans know that you’re behind them let them know you share their concern about protecting alaska’s wolves  please help save alaska’s wolves by doing these two things    sign the enclosed citizens’ advisory ballot to show your support  for repealing “same day airborne land and shoot” wolf killing in alaska    rush a special donation to help our alaska allies overturn this odious new law  remember for this emergency effort to succeed we must act immediately  so please take out your pen right now and sign your absentee ballot and then mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save alaska’s wolves  thank you for your strong support  sincerely  rodger schlickeisen  president  p s defenders needs your help to raise         in emergency funds to help ensure that the coalition’s emergency effort to save alaska’s wolves succeeds so please sign the  enclosed citizens’ advisory ballot to lend your moral support to our alaska friends and return it in the enclosed envelope with a special donation time is so short

  what to do  shopping  inflation has taken its toll in hong kong while it’s no  longer the bargain shopping destination it once was there are still  some good buys to be had since hong kong is a duty free port and  charges no sales tax goods are cheaper here than in the country where  they were made on photographic equipment electronic goods and  watches you avoid the luxury tax payable in your home country  specialty goods and souvenirs often handmade come from hong kong and  elsewhere in china custom made garments by skillful hong kong tailors  are still much in demand and cost less than elsewhere for comparable  garments note that alcohol and tobacco are both exceptions to hong  kong’s duty free regime and are subject to tax  you’ll find that prices are about the same in hong kong  central and kowloon and somewhat cheaper in causeway bay which caters  to local shopping large shops on the fashionable thoroughfares tend to  be more expensive than smaller “family” shops tucked away in the side  streets  stores do not open until   am or later but shopping goes on  into the evening up to     pm most shops are open seven days a week  shops in central are an exception they generally close at  pm and are  not open on sunday the only holiday on which all commerce comes to a  halt is the chinese new year in january or february  buyer beware be aware that name brands including  electronics are sometimes fakes glass may be sold as jade and that  antique you bought may have been made last night always ask for a  receipt that records information about the item and if you buy an  antique be sure to get a certificate of authentication needless to  say avoid peddlers who approach you on the street and offer to take  you to wondrous bargains  the large department stores have fixed prices but elsewhere  you should ask whether there is a discount especially if you buy  several items in one shop compare prices before you buy any  significant item always ask to see the manufacturer’s guarantee when  purchasing watches cameras and audio visual and electronic  equipment  note that when haggling the merchant assumes you are  prepared to pay cash if after concluding a deal you try to pay with  a credit card he may then boost the price in order to cover the card  charges  it is advisable to shop at outlets that are members of the  hong kong tourist association hkta identified by a red junk logo  membership imposes an obligation to maintain standards of both quality  and service and provides dissatisfied customers with an officially  recognized channel for redressing complaints the number to call is  tel           pick up a copy of hkta’s “the official dining  entertainment shopping directory” in which all member stores are  listed  shipping many stores will pack and ship purchases ask if  automatic free insurance is provided if the goods are very valuable or  fragile it is a good idea to buy an all risk insurance for the  shipment packages sent to the us or to europe generally take six to  eight weeks by surface mail and one week by airmail  shopping areas major shopping areas are tsim sha tsui in  kowloon especially along nathan road central on hong kong island  particularly for upscale designer goods causeway bay for slightly  better prices and the hollywood road area  department stores look for lane crawford ltd an upscale  store with branches at pacific place    queen’s road and harbour  city wing on one of the oldest in hong kong marks and spencer and  the japanese department stores mitsukoshi sobo and seibu  malls hong kong is full of giant malls harbour city just  west of the star ferry terminal in tsim sha tsui is one of the largest  pacific place    queensway is central’s biggest mall with retail  outlets and department stores times square is a collection of retail  outlets in causeway bay in addition most top line hotels have upscale  malls full of designer boutiques  factory outlets these stores sell excess stock or factory  overruns hong kong is no longer a factory outlet center since much of  its clothing manufacturing has moved elsewhere there are factory  showrooms in the pedder building    pedder street in central  markets markets are the places to use your bargaining  skills hong kong’s most famous and colorful market is the temple  street night market near the jordan mtr stop every conceivable kind of  goods is sold here clothing all kinds of electronics cds souvenirs  crafts and jewelry  stanley market is located on hong kong’s southern coast  and is well known for all kinds of clothing including silk and  cashmere bargain and carefully examine any merchandise you buy  here  the jade market on kansu street in yau ma tei is known  for both jade and freshwater pearls this is not the

in hong kong look for fine chinese  bronzes embroidery lacquerware and porcelain tomb figures and wood  carvings among other possibilities the experts point out that it is  not age alone that determines a chinese antique’s value — the dynasties  of the past had their creative ups and downs for serious antiques try  honeychurch antiques at no    for furniture and silver tai sing  company at     for porcelain for fun you can visit the low price shop  at no    or the cat street crafts stores and flea market  brocades and silks fabrics from china are a bargain and  well worth taking home chinese product department stores stock silk  fabrics silk scarves finely embroidered blouses and traditional  padded jackets chinese arts and crafts is at pacific place in central  and in star house in tsim sha tsui crc department store is on hennessy  road in causeway bay for fabrics also try western market morrison  street in central  cameras photo buffs know that hong kong is the place to  buy some of the world’s most advanced photographic equipment and there  are some real bargains around however be sure you compare prices and  models before buying two reliable places to start looking in lan kwai  fong are photo scientific in the eurasia building and hing lee camera  company    lyndhurst terrace  carpets and rugs hong kong is a mecca for chinese  hand knotted wool carpets and silk rugs hong kong’s stores are usually  able to arrange shipment caravan at    hollywood road and the shops in  the silk road at ocean center in tsim sha tsui are good places to start  looking  china porcelain in hong kong you can have a plate or  even a whole dinner service hand painted to your own design factories  in kowloon and the new territories producing traditional and modern  china are geared to entertain and instruct visiting tourists prices  are appealing two of the largest places to go are the wah tung china  company in the grand marine industrial building in aberdeen and the  overjoy porcelain factory in block b of the kwai hing industrial  building kwai chung in the new territories in antiques shops look  for highly valued porcelains from china note that because of the  duty free situation good bargains may be found in european china  including spode and wedgwood  electronics the latest gadgets are sometimes available in  hong kong before anywhere else before you begin shopping pick up  hkta’s “shopping guide to consumer electronics ” prices on electronics  have risen in the past two years check prices at home before you buy  here nathan road has many electronics shops also check out star  computer city in the star house near the star ferry terminal  furniture the choice ranges from traditional hand carved  chinese rosewood furniture to well made reproductions of modern western  styles rattan furniture is highly popular hollywood road has several  furniture shops queen’s road east in wan chai is a furniture  manufacturing and retail area  jade “ good for the health” is just one of the many  magical qualities that are attributed to these beautiful emerald green  or turquoise stones real jade is extremely expensive and you may be  offered counterfeit jade which looks exactly like the genuine article  some people say you can test the authenticity by touch — real jade  feels smooth and cool alternatively you can shine a lamp on the  stone — real jade shows no reflected light better still go shopping  with an expert  jewelry thanks to the duty free situation prices in hong  kong are lower than they are in some other places you can buy  gemstones loose or set or have them made up to your own design  popular purchases include diamonds and freshwater pearls if you do  plan to buy jewelry be sure to consult the “shopping guide to  jewellery” published by the hong kong tourist authority to find a  reputable dealer  kitchen equipment woks and any other gadgets essential for  chinese cookery make good purchases department stores sell all sorts  of intriguing kitchen equipment  leather goods leather is not a great bargain in hong kong  locally made items do not live up to their european models however  the leather garment industry is growing and there is a wide range of  locally produced leather accessories all at extremely attractive  prices for european imports you will pay top dollar  musical audio and video equipment hong kong has a vast  range of the most high tech audio visual sound and screen equipment  before purchasing visitors should make sure of compatibility with  systems in their own countries be sure to look around and compare  before buying whatever you buy you may be able to work out a  discount  ready to wear clothes hong kong’s shops carry almost every  recognizable european and many american labels from top end designers  to the moderately priced or trendy nathan road central and the hotel  malls are places to look there are still a great many factory outlet  stores with reasonable prices you’ll also find bargain clothes for  sale at the markets and on push carts  tailoring tailor made clothes are not as popular in hong  kong as they were in the past but hundreds of shops still remain  local tailors are experts when it comes to producing custom tailored  garments for both men and women and are also adept at copying  patterns the result can be a quality suit at a
