  introduction  older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight  even though there is little evidence that overweight is  associated with increased mortality in those over age  six large controlled population based studies of  non smoking older adults have investigated the association  between body mass index bmi and mortality controlling  for relevant covariates             all studies found  excess risk for persons with very low bmi but that persons  with moderately high bmi had little or no extra risk except  in certain small subsets a review of    studies of older  adults drew similar conclusions  many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain  throughout adult life it may be that a small amount of  gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the  most robust health as we age it has been suggested that  weight standards be adjusted upwards for age   such  recommendations remain controversial however because the  number of studies of older persons is fairly small and  because few studies have examined the relation of bmi to  quality of life or years of healthy life yhl in the  elderly  in older adults risk factors may have a greater effect  on health than on mortality if so then behavior change  trials of weight modification might be more successful if  they were evaluated on improved health rather than on  decreased mortality clinical trials powered to detect  differences in yhl would often require fewer subjects than  trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular  events    in this paper we study whether bmi at  baseline is associated with living longer and or with more  years of being healthy in a cohort of older adults for  whom risk factors subclinical disease and morbidity are  well characterized the goal is to determine whether  analyses based on years of life yol or on yhl would  provide substantively different results and which measure  would yield more powerful evaluations of weight  modification interventions in older adults  materials and methods  study design the cardiovascular health  study  the cardiovascular health study chs is a  population based longitudinal study of       adults aged     and older at baseline    subjects were recruited  from a random sample of the medicare eligibility lists in  four us counties extensive baseline data were collected  for all subjects using a baseline home interview an  annual mail questionnaire and annual clinic  examinations additional information was collected in a  brief telephone interview   months after each scheduled  visit two cohorts were followed one with   years of  follow up n       and the second all african  american n     with   years of follow up to date  data collection began in      and follow up is virtually  complete for all surviving subjects  body mass index  bmi was calculated as measured weight in kilograms  divided by the square of measured height in meters a  report from the national heart lung and blood institute  classifies normal weight without reference to age as a  bmi of      to      overweight as    to      and  obesity as      and higher    we consider  separately the group with bmi between      and    which  was associated with lower survival in studies cited  above  years of life and years of healthy life  yol is the number of years that a person lived in the    years after baseline yhl is the number of years in  which the person was healthy and is similar in concept  to quality adjusted life years healthy year equivalents  or active life expectancy    we based yhl on  self rated health is your health excellent very good  good fair or poor evgfp which was collected every  months evgfp is a simple but well known measure which  has been studied in detail       and is predictive  of health events in many studies    because we are  examining health status over time we added a sixth  health state dead data were available about    of the  time we used linear interpolation to estimate missing  data when there were known values before and after the  missing value bringing the percent complete to  for this analysis we defined yhl as the number of  years of   in which a person reported excellent very  good or good health were healthy yhl ranges from  for persons who were never in excellent very good or  good health to   years for persons who were healthy  throughout since people reported their health every  months yhl has a reasonably continuous distribution a  drawback of this simple definition of healthy is that  it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and  death since all are considered not healthy we also  used an alternative approach which assigns a different  value to each level of evgfp    preliminary results  were similar for the two approaches however and we  report results using only the simpler definition  the calculations had to be modified to include the  persons in the second african american cohort who have  been followed only   years to date for those persons  and for    persons in the first cohort who did not have  complete data we estimated the last   years of yol and  yhl from their age sex and health at the end of  years using validated methods presented elsewhere  that article showed that estimated   year yol and yhl  were unbiased for the african american cohort in the  primary analysis we used observed   year yol and yhl when  they were available and observed   year yol and yhl plus    year estimated yol and yhl when they were not about     of the sample we performed all analyses with and  without the persons who had partially estimated data to  ensure that the estimation had not distorted the  findings  covariates  the goal is to examine the association of yol and yhl  with bmi to adjust for possible confounding we chose  baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly  related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies  and likely to be related to bmi self reported covariates  include age gender smoking never or former history  of arthritis cancer diabetes fair or poor self rated  health status limitations in activities of daily living  or in instrumental activities of daily living and  pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before  baseline clinical covariates include hypertension  cardiovascular disease prevalent heart disease  peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease  maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery  depression cesd score serum albumin serum  cholesterol and serum creatinine these measures are  explained in more detail elsewhere             we  excluded     current smokers and     others with  incomplete covariate data leaving       persons on whom  this analysis is based  analysis  all analyses were performed separately for men and  women we calculated two sets of adjusted values as  follows we regressed yol and yhl first on age age  squared race and smoking history former or never and  second on all of the covariates listed above we  calculated adjusted yol as a person s observed yol minus  predicted yol from the regression plus the mean yol       years for women or      for men that is a  person s adjusted yol is his residual from the regression  plus the grand mean the mean of this new variable for a  group of subjects is the adjusted mean yol for that  group adjusted yhl was calculated in a similar manner  we calculated two sets of adjusted variables because of  the possibility of over adjustment controlling  inappropriately for factors such as diabetes which may  have been causally affected by the person s weight we  plotted mean adjusted yol and yhl against bmi and tested  for difference among bmi groups using confidence  intervals or analysis of variance finally we calculated  the effect size for each measure comparing each bmi  subgroup to the normal group the effect size is the  difference in mean yol or yhl in two groups divided by  their common standard deviation since the sample size  required to detect an effect of this magnitude is  proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size  large effect sizes are desirable  results  table  shows the distribution of key variables by sex  and race mean age at baseline was      and about two  thirds of the men and a third of the women were former  smokers black women had a higher mean bmi and higher  percent obese bmi ≥    than the other three groups black  men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than     pounds in the past year white women were least  likely  about    of the subjects were healthy at baseline  declining to    at the end of   years    had died data  not shown of the    who were unhealthy fair or poor at  baseline about    were healthy   years later there was  thus substantial change in evgfp over time in both  directions table  shows the mean yol and yhl calculated  from evgfp in the first seven years of the study adjusted  to age    for example black women averaged     yol but  only     yhl of a maximum possible   we calculated some  additional descriptive statistics shown in the final two  lines years of unhealthy life yol minus yhl and years  lost to death   minus yol white women had the most yhl  and black men the fewest black women had the most years of  unhealthy life and white men the fewest black men lost  the most years to death     out of   while white women  lost only     years for blacks about    of their yol  were healthy yhl yol not shown for whites about  were healthy  among whites the gender differences in table  were  statistically significant p    except for bmi and  unintended weight loss among blacks gender differences  were significant except for    pounds unintended weight  loss and weight loss since age    among males there were  significant differences between black and white for bmi  unintended weight loss yol yhl years of unhealthy life  and years lost to death whites in the sample had higher  income and education data not shown after adjusting for  income and education as well as age and former smoking  the difference in bmi was no longer statistically  significant among females blacks and whites differed  significantly on bmi bmi    weight loss since age  yol yhl years of unhealthy life and years lost to death  after adjustment for income and education the difference  in weight loss since age    was no longer significant  blacks had significantly lower yol and yhl than whites  after adjustment for age but the difference disappeared  after adjustment for the entire set of health related  baseline covariates analyses not shown  we next examined the relationship of bmi to yol and yhl  table  presents the mean values of yol and yhl adjusted  for age race and previous smoking columns   and   and  also adjusted for the entire set of covariates columns  and   for example yol for women adjusted for age race  and smoking averaged     years for women with a baseline  bmi below      but averaged     years for women with a bmi  from    to      the second column which shows results  adjusted for all covariates is not very different the  only discrepancy is for men with bmi      a category  containing only    men adjustment for extensive  covariates also made little difference for yhl columns  and   subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age  race and former smoking as mentioned above the group  with bmi from      to    would be considered normal by  the nhlbi guidelines but had lower yol and yhl than those  with         in all comparisons for this reason and to  increase sample size for those with low bmi we combined  the two lower categories defining underweight as a bmi  under  figure  is a plot of adjusted yol and yhl by sex and  bmi for each bmi category the mean and its    confidence  interval are plotted categories whose confidence intervals  do not overlap or overlap only slightly are significantly  different the bars are slightly offset to permit all error  bars to be seen  yol for women the uppermost curve on figure   averaged  about     out of   years and showed no evident association  between bmi and yol for bmi above    underweight women  averaged about    fewer yol than other women p  compared with normal group underweight men also had lower  yol but this group was not significantly different from  the normal group in part because of low sample size men  classified as normal overweight or obese all had about the  same yol  the lowermost two lines in figure  show mean yhl for  women and men women who were normal or overweight averaged  about     yhl the yhl for underweight or obese women was  about     years which was significantly lower than the  normal group the relationship of bmi to yhl for men is  similar but differences among bmi groups were not  statistically significant yhl was significantly higher for  women than for men in the normal and overweight groups but  the sexes had similar yhl in the underweight and obese  groups  we next present the effect size for comparing each group  to the normal bmi group the effect sizes are shown in  table   with the significance results of the associated  t tests for the differences in means of the two groups  being compared for example underweight women averaged       yhl compared to      for normal women and the common  standard deviation was      the effect size is thus                    the two groups had significantly  different yhl implying that the effect size is also  significantly greater than zero a clinical trial of a  treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight  presumably by addressing the underlying cause could be  expected to have    power with n  about    women per treatment arm if   year yhl were the  outcome measure  the biggest effect sizes are in the first row comparing  underweight to normal yhl and yol have similar effect  sizes for women and are significantly different from zero  the effect sizes are not significantly different from zero  for men in part because there were only    men in the  underweight category the effect size comparing overweight  to normal yielded small non significant effect sizes with  inconsistent signs suggesting extremely large sample sizes  would be needed for comparing obese to normal only yhl  for women showed a large and significant effect size thus  an intervention to improve the health of underweight women  to that of their normal weight peers could be performed  using either yhl or yol as the outcome variable trials to  make obese women comparable to normal women could be  evaluated using yhl but not yol trials to improve the  health of the other groups to that of the normals would  probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being  overweight for men or women or obese for men affects  yol or yhl  as mentioned above we repeated these analyses excluding  the persons with partially estimated data and using two  different ways of coding yhl the only substantive change  was that some of the differences between blacks and whites  shown in table  were no longer statistically significant  due to a smaller sample size  discussion  optimal weight and overweight  recent studies have defined obesity without reference  to age         andres  et al proposed a desirable bmi of        for persons aged    to      allison  et al    proposed       for  older men and       for older women in figure   the  overweight as opposed to the obese are no different  from those of normal weight suggesting that these two  categories could be combined for older adults since  future improvements in life expectancy may be limited     the greatest advances may be made by improving  people s yhl this suggests that the development of  future guidelines should take yhl or other measures of  quality of life into account  implications for clinical trials  based on these findings trials to address obesity in  older women could be efficient if yhl but not yol was  the outcome measure that is women who changed from  being obese to being normal would likely show changes in  yhl but not yol clinical trials of weight modification  interventions for older adults who were merely overweight  would appear to be fruitless since the interventions  would probably not have a direct effect on either yol or  yhl  weight or weight change are sometimes used as the  outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or  exercise programs the fact that weight is not associated  in a consistent way with health suggests that such  evaluations should be considered critically when older  adults are the subjects this is particularly important  in the light of recent findings which found that  interventions such as weight loss drugs may be harmful        for older adults the risks associated with  higher weight are especially unclear and the optimal  outcome for a trial of weight loss in older adults  requires specific attention to improved health and  mortality  interestingly the strongest health relationships were  found for underweight older adults clinical trials whose  objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their  normal weight peers presumably by addressing the  underlying conditions that caused the low weight could  be performed efficiently using either yol or yhl as the  outcome measure both yol and yhl would be clinically  significant in this patient group  potential limitations  chs participants were somewhat healthier than the  average older adult however adjustment for detailed  covariates made little difference in the findings we  estimated the last four years of health data for about     of the sample but results with and without this  group were similar analysis of mean yol instead of the  more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was  appropriate here since virtually no persons were lost to  follow up biases caused by over adjustment are probably  not large since the findings were not sensitive to the  number of variables adjusted for  these results are for a   year follow up the relative  superiority of yhl to yol would probably hold in trials  with shorter follow up the effect sizes in table  might  also be appropriate in shorter trials since lengthy  trials often add little information  evgfp on which yhl was based might have missed some  effects of obesity on risk factors for future health a  person who is depressed because of a poor self image  related to obesity or who has osteo arthritis related to  obesity and limits to activities to successfully avoid  pain would surely have worse evgfp than others based on  results from many studies however health measures  designed specifically to measure those conditions might  be more sensitive to change in weight than evgfp if yhl  were based on such measures the superiority of yhl to  yol would likely be even greater than that shown here  these more sensitive measures might also have detected  differences between the overweight and normal weight  persons but we think this is unlikely given the absence  of any differences in evgfp  conclusion  recommendations for desirable weight have been  criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health we  found associations between yhl and obesity that were not  present in the mortality analysis suggesting that yhl may  be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in  older adults especially for women future efforts to  determine desirable weight guidelines should include  measures of yhl using either yol or yhl however we found  no excess risk for older adults who would be classified as  overweight by the nhlbi guidelines this suggests using  yhl as the outcome measure in clinical trials involving  obese or underweight older adults and discouraging trials  that address older adults who are merely overweight  competing interests  none declared  abbreviations  bmi body mass index  cesd center for epidemiologic studies

  the problem  three published       and one recently presented  randomized placebo controlled clinical trial have  unequivocally demonstrated that   hydroxy   methylgluatryl  coenzyme a hmg coa reductase inhibitors statins reduce  the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary  disease these trials found that when compared with  placebo statins significantly reduced the incidence of  death myocardial infarction unstable angina percutaneous  and surgical coronary revascularization and stroke in  persons with  stable coronary disease because  patients who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome  within three to six months of enrollment were excluded  these trials did not assess the effect of lipid lowering  therapy on adverse cardiovascular events in those with  recently  unstable coronary disease whether  lipid lowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if  initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome  is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse  cardiac events is much greater in patients with unstable  coronary disease than in the stable setting the myocardial  ischemia reduction with aggressive cholesterol lowering  miracl trial set out to answer this question  the answer  miracl enrolled       patients within       hours mean     hours of admission for unstable angina or a non q wave  myocardial infarction and randomized them to    weeks of  atorvastatin    mg or placebo once daily   the major  exclusion criteria were total cholesterol level greater  than     mg dl q wave myocardial infarction on admission  or during the previous month and coronary  revascularization in the months before admission during  the index hospitalization or anticipated following hospital  discharge the primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of  death non fatal myocardial infarction resuscitated sudden  cardiac death or emergent rehospitalization for worsening  symptomatic myocardial ischemia secondary endpoints  included stroke worsening heart failure need for coronary  revascularization and change in lipid levels throughout the  study on average patients were    years of age  approximately    were men    caucasian and the mean  baseline low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol level  was     mg dl atorvastatin treatment was associated with a      absolute reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint       vs      rr relative risk rr  confidence interval ci           p       this  reduction was primarily driven by the     absolute  reduction in incidence of emergent rehospitalization for  symptomatic myocardial ischemia     vs     rr     ci           p      the risk of death nonfatal  myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death  were each no different between the two groups while there  were no significant differences in the incidence of  worsening heart failure or need for coronary  revascularization atorvastatin did reduce the incidence of  fatal or non fatal stroke by         vs     rr     ci           p       atorvastatin also  significantly reduced total and ldl cholesterol and  triglyceride levels but did not significantly change high  density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol by    weeks by  weeks the adjusted mean ldl cholesterol decreased to  mg dl in atorvastatin treated patients but increased to  mg dl among placebo treated patients no serious adverse  events occurred as the result of treatment with  atorvastatin although reversible liver transaminase  elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal  occurred in     of atorvastatin treated versus     of  placebo treated patients p  the miraculous  the efficacy and safety findings from miracl were unique  for a number of reasons although lipid lowering therapy  was associated with a significantly lower mortality when  initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome in two  large observational studies     miracl was the first  randomized trial to suggest that statins confer clinical  benefits in this setting it was also the first trial to  identify a short term ie within    weeks clinical  benefit from statin therapy in previous secondary  prevention trials the benefit of statin therapy was not  evident for one to two years and while clinical trial  safety endpoints may be considered less glamorous miracl s  most important contribution may have been that high dose  statin therapy was not associated with serious harm  despite its use in the unstable setting earlier secondary  prevention statin trials had excluded patients with  unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical  concern that statin mediated reductions in vascular smooth  muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque  that no harm resulted from this aggressive treatment  strategy should allay theoretical fears and by doing so  remove a major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of  lipid lowing therapy after coronary events  the not so miraculous  despite these unique and important findings there were  a number of inherent study limitations worth noting first  and foremost the possibility of a null treatment effect  cannot be ignored given the wide confidence intervals and  hence marginally significant p value of       for the  effect of atorvastatin on the primary efficacy endpoint  furthermore while the number of patients lost to follow up  was small if adverse events had occurred in those treated  with atorvastatin n   but not placebo n   the  overall trial results may have been neutral rather than  positive  the types of events prevented in miracl are also worth  noting while rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial  ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and  health care costs other important endpoints were not  significantly affected eg death myocardial infarction  resuscitated sudden cardiac death worsening heart failure  need for coronary revascularization etc the question of  whether statins can prevent these and other adverse events  when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will  require further study  the short duration of follow up is also particularly  troubling while it is impressive that a clinical benefit  was realized after only    weeks of statin therapy the  increased risk of adverse clinical events persists  throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome  without longer clinical follow up it is not possible to  assess the intermediate term effect if any of  atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial  infarction to do so would be critical in light of the lack  of effect on these important endpoints at    weeks  unfortunately no late clinical follow up is planned  there were also a number of limitations that may have  hampered the study s generalizability first patients who  underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was  planned were excluded specifically patients who underwent  percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca or  coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery within the  previous three or six months respectively were not eligible  for inclusion the investigators reasoned that recurrent  ischemic events in this population were likely to result  from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins  would be less likely to affect these processes  nevertheless a number of trials have established the  benefits of statin therapy  early after coronary  revascularization         furthermore a number of  recent trials have suggested that higher risk patients with  non st elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when  an early invasive strategy is applied          and it  is not uncommon for patients to be treated in this fashion  second patients with q wave myocardial infarction were not  eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins  would not influence the development of important prognostic  determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction  ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications  nevertheless patients who develop electrocardiographic  q waves represent a substantial proportion of all patients  with myocardial infarction while their short term risk  following hospital discharge is lower relative to those  with a non q wave myocardial infarction it is still much  greater than in patients with stable coronary disease and  the need for secondary prevention in this population is  equally important third despite the high risk nature of  enrolled patients ie electrocardiogram ecg changes  and or other objective evidence of ischemia the rate of  platelet glycoprotein iib iiia inhibitor utilization was  quite low     such therapy appears to be cost effective        especially among high risk patients and is  recommended under current american college of  cardiology american heart association guidelines  fourth it may not be possible to ascertain whether these  findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary  syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels the small  difference in number of primary endpoint events between  atorvastatin and placebo groups make it difficult to  dissect the relationship between baseline lipid levels and  treatment effect further consequently it remains  uncertain whether one can extrapolate the miracl trial  results to those who undergo coronary revascularization  shortly before or after a coronary event who present with  a q wave myocardial infarction who are treated with  platelet glycoprotein iib iiia inhibitors or who have  relatively low admission ldl cholesterol levels  time to change current practice  although miracl and the two aforementioned cohort  studies suggest that lipid lowering agents exert short term  clinical benefits when initiated soon after an acute  coronary syndrome this remains an open question even if  these findings are not confirmed after further study one  could still make a compelling argument that lipid lowering  therapy barring contraindications should be initiated  early and universally in patients who present with an acute  coronary syndrome first the long term safety and  effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of  stable coronary disease is  well established       second as evidenced by  miracl these agents are safe when initiated at the time of  hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome third the  in hospital initiation of lipid lowering therapy appears to  promote greater long term utilization of these agents           finally although lipid levels may be  unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome  excepting total hdl and ldl hdl cholesterol ratios  the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary  disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and  non pharmacologic lipid lowering interventions to attain  recommended cholesterol targets          newer  guidelines are even more stringent    furthermore  data from the recently presented heart protection study  suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of  baseline cholesterol level   thus to withhold  lipid lowering therapy from patients who present with an  acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo  and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the  secondary prevention setting have been dismal  more miracles ahead  the ascertainment and quantification of any incremental  benefit conferred by statin therapy initiated early after  an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation there  is currently only one ongoing randomized placebo controlled  trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this  setting a   z aggrastat to zocor merck    the  a   z study is evaluating the efficacy of early treatment  with simvastatin in       patients following an episode of  unstable angina or a non q wave myocardial infarction in  the first four months patients will be randomized to  simvastatin    mg daily or placebo thereafter those  patients treated with simvastatin in the first phase will  receive    mg of simvastatin daily and those treated with  placebo    mg of simvastatin daily the primary composite  endpoint is the occurrence of cardiovascular death  non fatal myocardial infarction or rehospitalization for  an acute coronary syndrome acs at one year if a   z  demonstrates significant reductions in the incidence of  adverse events during the first four months it would  suggest an incremental clinical benefit from initiating  these agents early after an acute coronary syndrome if  benefits accrue but do so later during follow up it would  be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more  aggressive vs earlier lipid lowering therapy  the pravastatin or atorvastatin evaluation and infection  therapy prove it trial is looking at       patients  within    days of an acute coronary syndrome and  randomizing them to either pravastatin    mg or  atorvastatin    mg daily    patients will be observed  over at least     years for the occurrence of myocardial  infarction or other cardiovascular events unlike miracl  and the a   z trials this study will not assess the  efficacy of early statin therapy after an acute coronary  syndrome rather it will examine the role of  more vs  less aggressive lipid lowering in  this setting  in      many would consider it unethical to withhold  statins from patients with established coronary disease  this makes it unlikely that additional placebo controlled  trials will be carried out in this area future secondary  prevention studies should look at patients with stable  or unstable disease and will need to  address the comparative efficacy of different statins or  newer agents assess the incremental benefit of  combination therapy    and determine whether there is a  serum cholesterol floor below which reductions are  unlikely to provide further clinical benefit  competing interests  dr aronow has received honoraria as a speaker and

  there is a much quoted saying attributed to the epidemiologist geoffrey rose “a large  number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases than a small number  exposed to a very high risk ” this is true for many individual risk factors such as salt  intake linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and speeding on the  highway linked to injuries and accidents does it apply to many other global health  risks the study by anthony rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does  to develop effective health policies one must understand the existing health risks and  disease burdens on a worldwide scale this is a tough challenge the global burden of  disease database maintained by the world health organization who collects data from  countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco malnutrition childhood abuse  unsafe sex childbirth and cholesterol levels as well as on disease burdens for example  depression blindness and diarrhea a large group of scientists from all over the world  has developed a framework to analyze these data to compare different risks or burdens  they calculate disability adjusted life years or dalys—the number of healthy life years  lost because of a particular disease or risk factor  rodgers and colleagues used data from the who database for    risk factors and from  epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of  risk factor attributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age  sex and exposure level for being underweight in childhood for example—the leading risk  factor for global loss of healthy life—they found that only    of the disease burden  occurred in severely underweight children the rest occurred in those only moderately  underweight the relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower but the  number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted  to almost two thirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor  the analysis confirms—and extends to a global level—previous research showing that many  major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels not just among  individuals exposed to high levels of risk it also points to risk factors that are  particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups and for which highly  targeted interventions could be effective  despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one such analyses are  essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life  years lost to premature death and disability
