  a wasted day  richard harding   part one  when its turn came the private secretary somewhat apologetically laid the  letter in front of the wisest man in wall street  “from mrs austin probation officer court of general sessions he explained  “wants a letter about spear he’s been convicted of theft comes up for sentence  tuesday ”  “spear ” repeated arnold thorndike  “young fellow stenographer used to do your letters last summer going in and out  on the train ”  the great man nodded “i remember what about him ”  the habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin  “went on the loose had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm  he’s with isaacs sons now shoe people on sixth avenue met a woman and  woke up without the money the next morning he offered to make good but isaacs  called in a policeman when they looked into it they found the boy had been  drunk they tried to withdraw the charge but he’d been committed now the  probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence a letter from  you sir would—”  it was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere young men who drunk or  sober spent the firm’s money on women who disappeared before sunrise did not  appeal to him another letter submitted that morning had come from his art agent  in europe in florence he had discovered the correggio he had been sent to find  it was undoubtedly genuine and he asked to be instructed by cable the price was  forty thousand dollars with one eye closed and the other keenly regarding the  inkstand mr thorndike decided to pay the price and with the facility of long  practice dismissed the correggio and snapped his mind back to the present  “spear had a letter from us when he left didn’t he ” he asked what he has  developed into since he left us—” he shrugged his shoulders the secretary  withdrew the letter and slipped another in its place  “homer firth the landscape man ” he chanted “wants permission to use blue flint  on the new road with turf gutters and to plant silver firs each side says it  will run to about five thousand dollars a mile ”  “no ” protested the great man firmly “blue flint makes a country place look like  a cemetery mine looks too much like a cemetery now landscape gardeners ” he  exclaimed impatiently “their only idea is to insult nature the place was better  the day i bought it when it was running wild you could pick flowers all the way  to the gates ” pleased that it should have recurred to him the great man smiled  “why spear ” he exclaimed “always took in a bunch of them for his mother don’t  you remember we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds  picking flowers ” mr thorndike nodded briskly “i like his taking flowers to his  mother ”  “he said it was to his mother ” suggested the secretary gloomily  “well he picked the flowers anyway ” laughed mr thorndike “he didn’t pick our  pockets and he had the run of the house in those days as far as we know ” he  dictated “he was satisfactory don’t say more than that ”  the secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil “and the landscape man ”  “tell him ” commanded thorndike “i want a wood road suitable to a farm and to  let the trees grow where god planted them ”  as his car slid downtown on tuesday morning the mind of arnold thorndike was  occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad the  japanese loan the new wing to his art gallery and an attack that morning in his  own newspaper upon his pet trust but his busy mind was not too occupied to  return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him or by  some genius of memory to recall the fact that it was on this morning young spear  was to be sentenced for theft it was a charming morning the spring was at full  tide and the air was sweet and clean mr thorndike considered whimsically that  to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding  a year to his sentence he regretted he had not given the probation officer a  stronger letter he remembered the young man now and favorably a shy silent  youth deft in work and at other times conscious and embarrassed but that on  the part of a stenographer in the presence of the wisest man in wall street was  not unnatural on occasions mr thorndike had put even royalty— frayed  impecunious royalty on the lookout for a loan—at its ease  the hood of the car was down and the taste of the air warmed by the sun was  grateful it was at this time a year before that young spear picked the spring  flowers to take to his mother a year from now where would young spear be  it was characteristic of the great man to act quickly so quickly that his friends  declared he was a slave to impulse it was these same impulses leading so  invariably to success that made his enemies call him the wisest man he leaned  forward and touched the chauffeur’s shoulder “stop at the court of general  sessions ” he commanded what he proposed to do would take but a few minutes a  word a personal word from him to the district attorney or the judge would be  enough he recalled that a sunday special had once calculated that the working  time of arnold thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute at that  rate keeping spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars  out of the sunshine mr thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing rotunda  shut in on every side hung by balconies lit many stories overhead by a dirty  skylight the place was damp the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice  and foul with the presence of many unwashed humans a policeman chewing stolidly  nodded toward an elevator shaft and other policemen nodded him further on to the  office of the district attorney there arnold thorndike breathed more freely he  was again among his own people he could not help but appreciate the dramatic  qualities of the situation that the richest man in wall street should appear in  person to plead for a humble and weaker brother he knew he could not escape  recognition his face was too well known but he trusted for the sake of spear  the reporters would make no display of his visit with a deprecatory laugh he  explained why he had come but the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did  not follow  the district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card henry spear ”  he exclaimed “that’s your man part three judge fallon andrews is in that  court ” he walked to the door of his private office “andrews ” he called  he introduced an alert broad shouldered young man of years of much indiscretion  and with a charming and inconsequent manner  “mr thorndike is interested in henry spear coming up for sentence in part three  this morning wants to speak for him take him over with you ”  the district attorney shook hands quickly and retreated to his private office  mr andrews took out a cigarette and as he crossed the floor lit it  “come with me ” he commanded somewhat puzzled slightly annoyed but enjoying  withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception mr  thorndike followed he decided that in his ignorance he had wasted his own time  and that of the prosecuting attorney he should at once have sent in his card to  the judge as he understood it mr andrews was now conducting him to that  dignitary and in a moment he would be free to return to his own affairs which  were the affairs of two continents but mr andrews led him to an office bare and  small and offered him a chair and handed him a morning newspaper there were  people waiting in the room strange people only like those mr thorndike had seen  on ferry boats they leaned forward toward young mr andrews fawning their eyes  wide with apprehension  mr thorndike refused the newspaper “i thought i was going to see the judge ” he  suggested  “court doesn’t open for a few minutes yet ” said the assistant district attorney  “judge is always late anyway ”  mr thorndike suppressed an exclamation he wanted to protest but his clear mind  showed him that there was nothing against which with reason he could protest he  could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice  he was making he had come among them to perform a kindly act he recognized that  he must not stultify it by a show of irritation he had precipitated himself into  a game of which he did not know the rules that was all next time he would know  better next time he would send a clerk but he was not without a sense of humor  and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing he laughed  good naturedly and reached for the desk telephone  “may i use this ” he asked he spoke to the wall street office he explained he  would be a few minutes late he directed what should be done if the market opened  in a certain way he gave rapid orders on many different matters asked to have  read to him a cablegram he expected from petersburg and one from vienna  “they answer each other ” was his final instruction “it looks like peace ”  mr andrews with genial patience had remained silent now he turned upon his  visitors a levantine burly unshaven and soiled towered truculently above him  young mr andrews with his swivel chair tilted back his hands clasped behind his  head his cigarette hanging from his lips regarded the man dispassionately  “you gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me ” he commented cheerfully to mr  thorndike the form of greeting was novel so greatly did it differ from the  procedure of his own office that he listened with interest  “was it you ” demanded young andrews in a puzzled tone “or your brother who  tried to knife me ” mr thorndike unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his  office unless escorted by bank messengers and plain clothes men felt the room  growing rapidly smaller the figure of the truculent greek loomed to heroic  proportions the hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin and from there fell  to his pearl pin which he hastily covered  “get out ” said young andrews “and don’t show your face here—”  the door slammed upon the flying greek young andrews swung his swivel chair so  that over his shoulder he could see mr thorndike “i don’t like his face ” he  explained  a kindly eyed sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon andrews with the  familiarity of an old acquaintance  “is that woman going to get a divorce from my son ” she asked “now that he’s in  trouble ”  “now that he’s in sing sing ” corrected mr andrews “i hope so she deserves it  that son of yours mrs bernard ” he declared emphatically “is no good ”  the brutality shocked mr thorndike for the woman he felt a thrill of sympathy  but at once saw that it was superfluous from the secure and lofty heights of  motherhood mrs bernard smiled down upon the assistant district attorney as upon  a naughty child she did not even deign a protest she continued merely to smile  the smile reminded thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by  murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his  native town  “that son of yours ” repeated young andrews “is a leech he’s robbed you robbed  his wife best thing i ever did for you was to send him up the river ”  the mother smiled upon him beseechingly  “could you give me a pass ” she said  young andrews flung up his hands and appealed to thorndike  “isn’t that just like a mother ” he protested “that son of hers has broken her  heart tramped on her cheated her hasn’t left her a cent and she comes to me  for a pass so she can kiss him through the bars and i’ll bet she’s got a cake  for him in that basket ”  the mother laughed happily she knew now she would get the pass  “mothers ” explained mr andrews from the depth of his wisdom are all like  that your mother my mother if you went to jail your mother would be just like  that ”  mr thorndike bowed his head politely he had never considered going to jail or  whether if he did his mother would bring him cake in a basket apparently there  were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience  young andrews sprang to his feet and with the force of a hose flushing a gutter  swept his soiled visitors into the hall  “come on ” he called to the wisest man “the court is open ”  in the corridors were many people and with his eyes on the broad shoulders of the  assistant district attorney thorndike pushed his way through them the people who  blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him their looks were anxious  furtive miserable they stood in little groups listening eagerly to a  sharp faced lawyer or in sullen despair eying each other at a door a tipstaff  laid his hand roughly on the arm of mr thorndike  “that’s all right joe ” called young mr andrews “he’s with me they entered  the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure in which were high oak  chairs again in his effort to follow mr thorndike was halted but the first  tipstaff came to his rescue “all right ” he signalled “he’s with mr  andrews ”  mr andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs “you sit there ” he commanded “it’s  reserved for members of the bar but it’s all right you’re with me ”  distinctly annoyed slightly bewildered the banker sank between the arms of a  chair he felt he had lost his individuality andrews had become his sponsor  because of andrews he was tolerated because andrews had a pull he was permitted  to sit as an equal among police court lawyers no longer was he arnold thorndike  he was merely the man “with mr andrews ”  then even andrews abandoned him “the judge’ll be here in a minute now ” said the  assistant district attorney and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the  judge’s bench there he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years  were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of mr andrews seated on  the rail with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to mr  thorndike they laughed and talked together the subject of their discourse was  one mike donlin as he appeared in vaudeville  to mr thorndike it was evident that young andrews had entirely forgotten him he  arose and touched his sleeve with infinite sarcasm mr thorndike began “my  engagements are not pressing but—”  a court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail  “sit down ” whispered andrews “the judge is coming ”  mr thorndike sat down  the court attendant droned loudly words mr thorndike could not distinguish there  was a rustle of silk and from a door behind him the judge stalked past he was a  young man the type of the tammany politician on his shrewd alert  irish american features was an expression of unnatural gloom with a smile mr  thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young  judge as was the robe to his shoulders mr thorndike was still smiling when young  andrews leaned over the rail  “stand up ” he hissed mr thorndike stood up  after the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words every one sat  down and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail  “i would like to speak to him now before he begins ” he whispered i can’t  wait ”  mr andrews stared in amazement the banker had not believed the young man could  look so serious  “speak to him now ” exclaimed the district attorney ’you’ve got to wait till  your man comes up if you speak to the judge now— the voice of andrews faded  away in horror  not knowing in what way he had offended but convinced that it was only by the  grace of andrews he had escaped a dungeon mr thorndike retreated to his  arm chair  the clock on the wall showed him that already he had given to young spear one  hour and a quarter the idea was preposterous no one better than himself knew  what his time was really worth in half an hour there was a board meeting later  he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad at every moment questions were being  asked by telegraph by cable questions that involved the credit of individuals  of firms of even the country and the one man who could answer them was risking  untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice inside the  railed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech he assured his honor  that he must have more time to prepare his case it was one of immense importance  the name of a most respectable business house was involved and a sum of no less  than nine hundred dollars nine hundred dollars the contrast struck mr  thorndike’s sense of humor full in the centre unknowingly he laughed and found  himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his night clothes  the tipstaffs beat upon the rail the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an  indignant exclamation andrews came hurriedly toward him and the young judge  slowly turned his head  “those persons ” he said “who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave  it ” as he spoke with his eyes fixed on those of mr thorndike the latter saw  that the young judge had suddenly recognized him but the fact of his identity did  not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered in even icy tones  the judge continued “and it is well they should remember that the law is no  respecter of persons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced no  matter who the offender may happen to be ”  andrews slipped into the chair beside mr thorndike and grinned  sympathetically  “sorry ” he whispered “should have warned you we won’t be long now ” he added  encouragingly “as soon as this fellow finishes his argument the judge’ll take up  the sentences your man seems to have other friends isaacs sons are here  and the type writer firm who taught him but what you say will help most it won’t  be more than a couple of hours now ”  “a couple of hours ” mr thorndike raged inwardly a couple of hours in this place  where he had been publicly humiliated he smiled a thin shark like smile those  who made it their business to study his expressions on seeing it would have  fled young andrews not being acquainted with the moods of the great man added  cheerfully “by one o’clock anyway ”  mr thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves for all he cared now young spear  could go hang andrews nudged his elbow  “see that old lady in the front row ” he whispered “that’s mrs spear what did i  tell you mothers are all alike she’s not taken her eyes off you since court  opened she knows you’re her one best bet ”  impatiently mr thorndike raised his head he saw a little white haired woman  who stared at him in her eyes was the same look he had seen in the eyes of men  who at times of panic fled to him beseeching entreating forcing upon him what  was left of the wreck of their fortunes if only he would save their honor  “and here come the prisoners ” andrews whispered “see spear third man from the  last ” a long line guarded in front and rear shuffled into the court room and  as ordered ranged themselves against the wall among them were old men and young  boys well dressed clever looking rascals collarless tramps fierce eyed aliens  smooth shaven thin lipped broadwayards—and spear  spear his head hanging with lips white and cheeks ashen and his eyes heavy with  shame  mr thorndike had risen and in farewell was holding out his hand to andrews he  turned and across the court room the eyes of the financier and the stenographer  met at the sight of the great man spear flushed crimson and then his look of  despair slowly disappeared and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and  gratitude he turned his head suddenly to the wall  mr thorndike stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair  the first man in the line was already at the railing and the questions put to him  by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney  and a court attendant his muttered answers were in turn repeated to the  judge  “says he’s married naturalized citizen lutheran church die cutter by  profession ”  the probation officer her hands filled with papers bustled forward and  whispered  “mrs austin says ” continued the district attorney “she’s looked into this case  and asks to have the man turned over to her he has a wife and three children has  supported them for five years ”  “is the wife in court ” the judge said  a thin washed out pretty woman stood up and clasped her hands in front of  her  “has this man been a good husband to you madam ” asked the young judge  the woman broke into vehement assurances no man could have been a better husband  would she take him back indeed she would take him back she held out her hands as  though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory  the judge bowed toward the probation officer and she beckoned the prisoner to  her  part two  other men followed and in the fortune of each mr thorndike found himself to his  surprise taking a personal interest it was as good as a play it reminded him of  the sicilians he had seen in london in their little sordid tragedies only these  actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not  know but which appealed to something that had been long untouched long in  disuse it was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because as he  appreciated it needed expression an outlet he found this partially in  praising through andrews the young judge who had publicly rebuked him mr  thorndike found him astute sane his queries intelligent his comments just and  this probation officer she too was capable was she not smiling at his  interest in what to him was an old story the younger man nodded  “i like her looks ” whispered the great man “like her clear eyes and clean skin  she strikes me as able full of energy and yet womanly these men when they come  under her charge ” he insisted eagerly “need money to start again don’t they ”  he spoke anxiously he believed he had found the clew to his restlessness it was  a desire to help to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being  lifted to their feet andrews looked at him curiously “anything you give her ” he  answered “would be well invested ”  “if you will tell me her name and address ” whispered the banker he was much  given to charity but it had been perfunctory it was extended on the advice of  his secretary in helping here he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure it was  much more satisfactory than giving an old master to his private chapel  in the rear of the court room there was a scuffle that caused every one to turn  and look a man who had tried to force his way past the tipstaffs was being  violently ejected and as he disappeared he waved a paper toward mr thorndike  the banker recognized him as his chief clerk andrews rose anxiously “that man  wanted to get to you i’ll see what it is maybe it’s important ”  mr thorndike pulled him back  “maybe it is ” he said dryly “but i can’t see him now i’m busy ”  slowly the long line of derelicts of birds of prey of sorry weak failures  passed before the seat of judgment mr thorndike had moved into a chair nearer to  the rail and from time to time made a note upon the back of an envelope he had  forgotten the time or had chosen to disregard it so great was his interest that  he had forgotten the particular derelict he had come to serve until spear stood  almost at his elbow  thorndike turned eagerly to the judge and saw that he was listening to a rotund  gray little man with beady bird like eyes who as he talked bowed and  gesticulated behind him stood a younger man a more modern edition of the other  he also bowed and behind gold eye glasses smiled ingratiatingly  the judge nodded and leaning forward for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the  prisoner  “you are a very fortunate young man ” he said he laid his hand upon a pile of  letters “when you were your own worst enemy your friends came to help you these  letters speak for you your employers whom you robbed have pleaded with me in  your favor it is urged in your behalf that at the time you committed the crime  of which you are found guilty you were intoxicated in the eyes of the law that  is no excuse some men can drink and keep their senses it appears you can not  when you drink you are a menace to yourself—and as is shown by this crime to the  community therefore you must not drink in view of the good character to which  your friends have testified and on the condition that you do not touch liquor i  will not sentence you to jail but will place you in charge of the probation  officer ”  the judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to mr andrews it was finished  spear was free and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving  toward the door their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been  many mr thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment even though the  result relieved and pleased him he wished in bringing it about he had had some  part  he begrudged to isaacs sons the credit of having given spear his liberty  his morning had been wasted he had neglected his own interests and in no way  assisted those of spear he was moving out of the railed enclosure when andrews  called him by name  “his honor ” he said impressively “wishes to speak to you ”  the judge leaned over his desk and shook mr thorndike by the hand then he made a  speech the speech was about public spirited citizens who to the neglect of their  own interests came to assist the ends of justice and fellow creatures in  misfortune he purposely spoke in a loud voice and every one stopped to  listen  “the law mr thorndike is not vindictive ” he said “it wishes only to be just  nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences but when there  is good in a man i personally want to know it and when gentlemen like  yourself of your standing in this city come here to speak a good word for a man  we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen i thank you for  coming and i wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and  public spirited ”  it was all quite absurd and most embarrassing but inwardly mr thorndike glowed  with pleasure it was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him  he had done well from the friends of spear there was a ripple of applause which  no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress and to the accompaniment of this  mr thorndike walked to the corridor he was pleased with himself and with his  fellow men he shook hands with isaacs sons and congratulated them upon  their public spirit and the type writer firm upon their public spirit and then  he saw spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully  spear did not offer his hand but mr thorndike took it and shook it and said  “i want to meet your mother ”  and when mrs spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she  was and how grateful he instead told her what a fine son she had and that he  remembered when spear used to carry flowers to town for her and she remembered  it too and thanked him for the flowers and he told spear when isaacs  sons went bankrupt which at the rate they were giving away their money to the  hebrew hospital would be very soon spear must come back to him and isaacs  sons were delighted at the great man’s pleasantry and afterward repeated it many  times calling upon each other to bear witness and spear felt as though some one  had given him a new backbone and andrews who was guiding thorndike out of the  building was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when  thorndike became a banker  the chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile with  written calls for help from the office they pounced upon the banker and almost  lifted him into the car  “there’s still time ” panted the chief clerk  “there is not ” answered mr thorndike his tone was rebellious defiant it  carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune “i’ve wasted most of this  day ” he declared “and i intend to waste the rest of it andrews ” he called  “jump in and i’ll give you a lunch at sherry’s ”  the vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building  “wait till i get my hat ” he called  as the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them the sense  of duties neglected added zest to their holiday and young mr andrews laughed  aloud  mr thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly “i was wondering said andrews  “how much it cost you to keep spear out of jail ”  “i don’t care ” said the great man guiltily “it was worth it ”

remember papa s stopbox a teal blue tiempo capturado that mama brought home  for his birthday it was huge and inefficient and she should never have spent  so many pesos on a toy but papa would not let her return it he used it to  preserve baby tomatoes cucumbers and strawberries in translucent cubes that he  stored in the pantry for spring time meals in the middle of winter mama kept  her mink jacket a family hand me down safe from time in a stopbox and lent  the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection sometimes they would let us  little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we  begged them for its release usually a few hours after enclosing it  when my father died a year after my mother my sisters and i cleaned out their  apartment we found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes i took mine home  where they sat above my computer while i worked on my first play one night when  i did not believe love had ever existed for anyone i used my own capturador a  sleek titanium sanyo tardar ahora to undo the stopbox bringing my face close  to the shoes i breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing  up that symbol of their love for me  the instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they  were encased but as soon as i coughed i laughed and i did not try to kill  myself that night  let me begin again  i like life on the resort worlds always have and after the upcoming  mindwipe always will last year i rented a small house on vega iv a sea  world all islands and reefs and archipelagos turquoise waters and aquamarine  skies sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova there s  only one city called nuevo acapulco in la enciclopedia del empirio de la  humanidad it s n apulco to the locals the n apulcans are mostly emigrants from  polaris ii the only difference between them and their carribbean ancestors is  that the ancestors fleeced noram tourists now the n apulcans profit from their  hispanic siblings  i don t mean to sound cynical i suppose i wish to show that i m still capable  of a certain authorial distance a semblance of dispassionate observation the  following events may indicate otherwise  in fine tourist tradition most homes on vega iv are named mine was the  sleeping flamingo and its outer walls were coral pink were they  mood sensitive they would have changed as i first viewed them the rental  agent an attractive n apulcan named tasha cortez was not mood sensitive  either she said it s beautiful isn t it señor flynn  my instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat  and take me elsewhere but she was young and attractive as i have said and may  say again and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous bernardo flynn  that i merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism and then because a  playwright cannot resist a promising line i said your sleeping flamingo  should be put to sleep  to say her face fell would do a disservice to tasha and to literature allow me  my self indulgences as you would those of a dying man when i convince my  mindsmith to permit the wipe there will be another bernardo flynn one who  knows no more of tasha cortez or vega iv than he reads here her brows drew  together creasing the lovely caramel colored skin around her eyes and showing  the pattern for an old woman s wrinkles on her forehead her lower lip a trifle  too narrow for her face perhaps her only physical flaw thrust forward slightly  as she started to speak she caught herself slid her jaw infinitesimally back  into place and said you don t like it  i laughed what could i do i clapped her shoulder to show i was not laughing at  her like it i hate it despise it abhor it it s gaudy graceless  pretentious that house is an affront to taste and intelligence i should buy  it to raze it but i am not so kind hearted i might however rent it  i think she only heard the last words of my speech you will  it amuses me show me around and then i shall decide  of course señor flynn  and stop calling me señor not even los mundos is so polite call me  bernardo  if you wish  i beg you change the color of the walls at the very least  but of course the house walls shifted from pink to lavender  i stared  how s that  i looked at her  worse  i nodded i would not have thought it possible  she frowned it is rather ugly  thoroughly ugly i corrected with smile  obscenely ugly said she smiling too  no i pointed it has no tower  i can fix that she reached for another dial on the house controls  don t you dare her wrist when i grabbed it was smooth and strong and warm  in my fingers i ll take it exactly as it is  you will  i must god knows what you might do to it next reluctantly i released her  hand  the interior of the flamingo was a welcome surprise cloudwood had been used in  a mediterranean manner making the house seem primitive and civilized at the  same time the kitchen and baths had every convenience that i desired from the  living room the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that tasha  asked if i felt ill all i could say was no i m in love we both thought i  referred to the vista  it s strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life  forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one  would remember and suddenly the forgotten in revenge rears up to savage the  unwary so it was as i wrote the preceding my heart convulsed and i left this  manuscript for a three day spree apparently i was so successful that it lasted  a week and a half not bad for an eighty three year old even for one who has  his rejuve every month and if i can brag and digress so easily this must not  be painful enough to merit a mindwipe yes  no i abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately  thinking that bernardo flynn should receive such services when he needed them  even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight my mindsmith is not  so understanding she says i am emotionally a child to which i reply of  course why else would i come to you this logic does not soothe her she says  i must wait three weeks three such is the law i say i do not care about law  i care about service and she should care about money enough i went on a spree  and it must have been a good one i hope the wipe is as successful with my time  on vega iv as my spree was with my time here i dimly remember three bedpartners  who were probably human and one that i hope was delirium i will not answer the  phone for a week no matter whose face appears on it  i keep evading the issue but which issue the issue of why i am evading the  issue or the issue itself to deal with the first it hurts to remember if i  am capable of love i loved tasha cortez if i am not i had the perfect mirror  for my narcissism  as for the issue itself i m no longer sure what i want to record the  playwright in me wants every scene of our time together the editor says no  only those that are relevant the sufferer says no only those which cause no  pain and the artist says no only those which cause the most pain for those  would be the truest memories  so i shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise i will not talk of the  first time tasha and i tried any act of sex or sport together i can remember  similar things with others tasha s witchery lay in making old acts new is that  love probably not but it is something marvelous and rare which is surely a  sign of love  if my love for her was the only important thing i would leave a holo of her  with a note dear future this is tasha cortez you loved her with warmest  regards your past  enough tasha and i walked through the sleeping flamingo together and i decided  to buy it then  this is not easy i stand up i walk around i pretend someone makes a vid about  a writer and i must enact every cliche i cannot decide what s important but i  have learned something writing trivializes the tasha who was is not the tasha  in this file the tasha in this file is not even the tasha i loved and thought i  knew the tasha in this file would walk through a net show in half an hour  including commercials and just before an ad for figuero s flash diapers  keeps baby driest she  tasha is not the whole of what happened on vega iv i must also write about  emiliano gabriel malaquez  future self you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between  the last sentence and this not another spree at least not like the other i  have been re reading all our favorite books  but neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects do we  i want to pick up with tasha and me walking about the sleeping flamingo and  then for the sake of literary convenience to say that from a corner of the  yard i saw a neighboring house and the sight filled me with darkest  forebodings but the truth is that tasha pointed it out from the one place where  it could barely be seen and i only felt envy that it had been designed by  someone with understated good taste who lives there i asked  no one tasha replied  truth is always more boring than fiction for malaquez did not move into dream s  end until four or five months after i we how does one speak to one s future  self occupied the flamingo  i do not plan to write a book this narrative must move more quickly tasha and  i became lovers that evening after a good dinner of paella at her apartment i  made some small joke afterward about approving of her firm s business  incentives and she cried consoling her i began to suspect i loved her i  moved into the flamingo the next day and she gave up her apartment three weeks  later to join me it was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most  people believe it does not happen at all the sort of romance that sustains the  hopeless billions who regularly watch a wandering star called love which is to  say you and me future self  who was tasha cortez she was a twenty four year old terran standard n apulcan  who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunt s real estate  firm her family said she did it to support her father who was dying of a  particularly painful degenerative disease tasha said she woke up one morning  convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables she would become  one  she did not like my plays i had impressed her because i was famous and amusing  and not as i had hoped because i was a great artist that bothered yes and  intrigued me until i realized that she was bored by most plays movies and  vid she did not like being a spectator i often told her that she should have a  bio check to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance i often told her  too many things  search emiliano malaquez and you ll find he s a master of the captured  moment school of sculpture even the terran times has only praise for his work  to compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living  models he accents the illusion of reality i paraphrase his entry in la  enciclopedia humanica by doing life size scenes in the full round never the  easier frontal or three quarters view moreover he never did portraits of  famous people his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared  to it as is typical of his school his pieces are sealed in stopboxes the  shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that we re looking at an  instant snatched from under the hooves of time they say the cubes will outlast  planets and suns that when the universe dies the works of malaquez and his  followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of god s eye  yes self i am also bothered that this observation ignores half eaten cheese  sandwiches incomplete insect collections and locks of infants hair forgotten  in closets basements and warehouses  you see the inspiration for my latest play captured moments the mindwipe  will take its creation from my future self but time too often does that  without aid the play s second act concludes with the last fight between tasha  and me i have disguised us in the play and deleted one brief melodramatic  interchange now i will mention it in case i you decide to restore it shortly  before she left tasha said you steal from life for art bernardo you ll  impoverish yourself i only snarled at her and  my story leaps ahead of itself let me retreat and retrench  one night during n apulco s mild winter tasha returned to the flamingo saying  nardo nardo guess what  my mind was on other things you wish to become pregnant i suppose i could  assist a friend purely for the sake of the race of course  ever the altruist still if i do decide we could practice  later i said you ve been chosen to succeed the emperor  what  my guess  she batted at my nose like a cat silly nardo  then i give up  emil malaquez is buying the house up the hill  oh  you don t know who he is  well  nardo one of the many things i liked about her was that she often thought me  shockingly ignorant  that s uh i am never so quick witted in person as i am on the page  especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant  you know the sculptor he s had shows in brazil and new madrid and everywhere  he may be more famous than you  imagine that i remembered an article in the medusa and a photo of a work in  which     peso notes fell like confetti onto a small undersider sexlessly young  in grimy oversized clothing the child s face was a warground for wonder and  mistrust imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal  threads in the fluttering pesos the stars themselves might have fallen on the  undersider and the event would have been no less strange no less miraculous a  great artist will grace this world then  nardo she was never tolerant of my ego  well what s this more famous than me person like  i didn t meet him jealous old one  too bad if i thought he could free me from you  hah she wrapped her arms around my stomach you ll never be free of me old  man  the next evening she arrived with a stack of glistening stopboxes containing  sushi sashimi oysters in their shells and terran vegetables fresh plucked  from their hydroponic beds wondering about the reason for her extravagance i  asked how work had gone that day  emil came in he s taking dream s end  emil  you ve no memory left old one emil malaquez  ah you did that to test my affections  what  calling him by his first name i did that in a comedy once nights with karl  and groucho it was before your time  oh  the critics liked it  i m glad a moment later that s not why i called him emil  no  no we lunched together he s nice  oh  it wasn t like that  you re free  of course still it wasn t like that you think i sleep with every famous  person i meet  as you may have guessed we had talked about such things i do not claim ours  was a perfect affair only a wonderful one  tasha  do you  no  good i invited him to dinner tomorrow  oh  he ll be our neighbor you say we re becoming too insular that we need to  socialize  i ve socialized for sixty three years  nardo  yes  how should i reply her voice had grown quiet and i began to feel some guilt  i had it is true told her that we needed other company than our own i said  this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel  but knowing this did not mean i wanted it  i said truthfully it was the statement of a younger and crueler man than i  she screamed i haven t socialized with terra s elite for most of my life i  haven t socialized with hardly anyone for hardly any of my life and i invite a  neighbor one nice lonely man  i m sorry  who took me to what  i m sorry truly  oh she studied me as a suspicious puppy might then said i m sorry too  i suppose i sound like i m bragging when i talk of the things i m tired of  only because you are she smiled  i had to grin so i did true  he may come to dinner  if you wish he may be dinner  i love you  and i you months earlier we might have sought a bed a couch or a  comfortable chair at this point instead i asked is he handsome  you re jealous  a tiny bit extremely  content yourself old one he s four inches shorter than i his nose is big and  broken and  this is cosmetic  he s not that ugly i think they re his natural features  interesting  you could write a play about someone like him  perhaps  i think his face is his form of vanity it s the reverse of you with those  ridiculous stomach muscles old men should be fat  is emil  yes  i am jealous i ll eat two dinners tonight five deserts  she giggled and then we did make love   i ve been thinking about the mindwipe now two days away who said that those  who forget the past are doomed to repeat it i fear that may be true for me add  this to the reasons i write now to remember something perhaps even to learn  emil malaquez arrived after sundown carrying a small package wrapped in what  looked like real paper his evening dress was formal expensive and slightly  stained as that of all forgetful artists should be he was a jovial man with an  easy laugh and even uglier than tasha had suggested i liked him immediately  señor malaquez  please call me emil you must be bernardo tasha s told me much about you  all of it outrageous praise  all of it  ah she is wonderfully perceptive  he raised an eyebrow then guffawed has she said as much about me  she thinks you are a genius do come in  thank you stepping into the living room he said a beautiful house  i m glad you came after dark  tasha by accident or design had found an innocently erotic posture on the  couch where she lay with a book of m duvian prints emil she leapt up i  did not expect you  so early  on time it s unforgiveable but you re forgiven she nodded at the  package what s that  for your kindness in inviting a stranger into your home he held it out and  with a delighted oh tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper  i stopped writing and only the thought that i might miss the mindwipe kept me  from another spree i went walking but after n apulco rio seems no fit abode  for a creature of flesh i walked from this hotel to the old city past the end  of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard cracked pavement of city park but  undersiders left me alone perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost so i  returned and slept and now the mindwipe is thirteen hours away  the side of malaquez s parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen  of solid air bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a  friend or a bringer of food tasha oohed in awe i said frodo s been visiting  you eh  malaquez said your pet  hardly he lives around here somewhere i suppose he was attracted to the  commotion up the hill  ah malaquez said why frodo  tasha said a little fellow with big furry feet what else could he be  called she handed the sculpture to me  i almost dropped it i expected it to weigh no more than a holo heavy i  said as if he might not have known  he laughed my last piece was of four old undersiders crouched around a trash  fire be glad someone didn t toss that to you he spoke of his art with the  enthusiasm of a seven year old um i should wait to importune you but he  grinned shyly a confession and then a request and then you must forgive me  for being so forward it s not easy for me to ask a favor  relax i said it s easy for me to turn one down  he glanced at me and decided i was joking the surprising thing is that i was  good my last show  was glorious tasha said  was kindly received he said but an artist who would stay first among his  fellows can tell when he begins to fail  oh i hoped no one would bring up my last three plays  i must change my subject matter no more urchins dopers vagrants or whores  i want to do more traditional portraits he spoke quickly prepared to be  rejected would you permit me to do one of you i would pay  never i said  ah he shrugged lightly  nardo tasha said it s an honor  of course i said that s why i cannot take payment  oh oh thank you malaquez turned to tasha and you as well perhaps the two  of you together  her eyes became circles at the idea of being as she undoubtedly thought it  immortalized by emil malaquez catching herself she said casually oh and  then she smiled laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think  how much i loved her and said my god yes yes yes for a perfect moment  emil and tasha and i were one entity laughing until our lungs hurt  this is torture i had not considered that i might not write to learn but to  punish myself let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in  a few sentences after giving emil full rights to a sculpture of tasha and me  we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder lobsters boiled on terra and  unstopped still steaming on n apulco and cinnamon custard for desert then we  went out for a late swim  i had drunk too much i confess though we all had somehow tasha and i began  to argue the worth of solevgrad jazz as inconsequential a topic as i can  imagine she had studied it in school so she thought herself as an expert i  once had a neighbor who played it constantly loudly and badly so i thought i  knew it better malaquez tried to mediate but i saw him as siding with tasha  so i think did she the subject shifted from music to tasha s obsession with  fame undoubtedly by a leap that i made she had no choice but to follow i do  not remember any of this well just now nor do i care to those who are truly  curious may look at the last act of captured moments i remember suggesting  with characteristic tact that she add emil to her small list of major  accomplishments  malaquez glanced away embarrassed tasha looked at me as if to say i will  she said i feel sorry for you nardo i ll see emil home  yes i said do that and did not care what she did or why  emil asked you re all right i muttered something he must have interpreted as  assent they both walked up to emil s home while i watched the scarlet moonlight  ripple on distant waves disgusted with tasha but more disgusted with myself i  finally realized she would not return that night and went into the sleeping  flamingo to drink myself to sleep  she had not come home when i woke in mid morning i waited and drank a glass of  morningafter and three cups of coffee and wondered whether our affair could  survive the events of the night and whether i wanted it to perhaps i should  have invited emil to stay but even then i knew that sex was not the problem  between tasha and me the problem was that i have trouble distinguishing between  compromise and capitulation between symbols and substance shortly before noon  i climbed the sandy path to dream s end rehearsing my apology slowing only to  pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet  malaquez answered the door in blood red pajamas and a black silk robe sixty  years ago in a similar situation i had broken my knuckles on someone s face i  merely said is tasha here  he pursed his lips slightly then nodded yes  may i see her when he hesitated i said last night was my fault i hold it  against neither of you please let me talk to her  i  please  he looked me and at last said very well  we walked through his house in silence it was as attractive and as impersonal  as a decorator could arrange for tenants of unknown taste a tall narrow  stopbox stood in the center of one room sand trickled forever downward while  beads of water splashed across the sand s path if that was malaquez s work it  was a very minor effort but then i was in no mood to consider art i only  wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover that was easier than  despising myself  he paused before a bedroom door i should go in first to prepare her  i smiled she handles surprise surprisingly well  what would it hurt  true go ahead tell her i shrugged tell her i love her  he studied me then said i m sorry things happened this way bernardo i  didn t anticipate last night  i m very good at making things happen this way but if tasha will forgive me  he nodded repeated i am sorry then slipped into the next room i waited in  the dark carpeted hall a warm breeze came from silent vents above me i heard  no voices until malaquez said enter  i blinked when i opened the door sunlight filled malaquez s bedroom tasha lay  sprawled nude on a rumpled bed her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the  bed s teak frame she was looking slightly to my left smiling with trust and  satisfaction like one sexually content malaquez stood near her pointing  something at my chest though the morning sun shone fully on both of them it  shimmered around tasha  the part of my mind that remembered four months in noram during the great  cleaning sent me rolling across the floor malaquez was not prepared for me to  react so quickly or perhaps he waited too long for an expression i would not  have a gesture i would not make a poignant moment of repentence wonder  despair or love had he been faster he could have had rage i threw a chair at  him as he fell i scrambled onto him my knees pinning his arms my fingers  probing his neck  i shouted where is she tell me or i ll kill  he began to cry she left earlier this morning  her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed i hit him with the back of my  hand tell me malaquez  she wanted to be famous she did now she will be  he seemed to expect me to understand where i demanded squeezing his throat  until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture  i stared at the naked tasha most of his story i have pieced together since but  i understood enough as i knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy  throat he had made his name with a home capturador he began with small animals  and moved on to derelicts and undersiders people who would never be missed now  he had thought to use vacationers like tasha and me and when someone came  looking he would say we had gone island hopping in our windboat our boat would  disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose his  story would stand in either case  i wanted him to tell me more but he babbled begging me to forgive him to  understand i did not listen i took the capturador a matte black tiempo  capturado from his grip and studied it not really thinking about it or  malaquez or tasha i think i was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was  art so we accepted it as art or perhaps i was thinking about the things that  humanity made that would outlive our species but i was probably only looking at  my reflection in the capturador s lens had he said then that i should use it on  myself i might have  that moment passed i looked at malaquez his eyes opened wider while we watched  each other his lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound  i turned to touch the cube that was tasha s crypt she smiled in trust or  pleasure or pride an erotic mona lisa who would smile forever and i could  never know why  the controls of the capturador were more complex than those of a kitchen model  but i recognized the unstop tab i could free tasha if i did one of three  things would happen most likely she would be meat there is a reason why  stopboxes are most often used in kitchens less likely she would live the rest  of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slug s and the tiniest chance of  all she would blink as if i had just materialized in emil s bedroom and then  she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal  as i put my hand on the impervious surface of tasha s stopbox i heard malaquez  run for the door  it is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we  should hate know this my future self thanks to us emil malaquez s name will  live as long as his masterpiece a self portrait anguish endures  and tasha i could say that i did not dare to take responsibility for her fate  i could say that i chose out of consideration for her desire for fame some  critics already say waking with tasha is malaquez s finest work if science  finds a way to safely free the subjects of emil s art perhaps the i who reads  this file will know that my decision is wise but i cannot stop thinking that i  was never afraid of losing tasha to brain damage or death my fear is that she  would live and i would learn that i had lost her long before emil malaquez  translated her into a thing that can be kept admired and loved  for in my way i have done the same thing  i am ready for the mindwipe now  
    hotel california  fact sound is a vibration sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium and in space there is no medium so when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didn t keep the air in i heard nothing after the first whoosh of the air being sucked away there was lightning but no thunder eyes bulging in panic but no screams quiet and peaceful right such a relief to never again hear my crewmate jesse natter about his girl back on earth and that all expenses paid vacation for two she won last time he was on leave i swore if i ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again giving the camera a cheesy thumbs up from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches i d kiss a monkey metaphorically of course  fact if before all the air is sucked out of the ship a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit that person has less than twenty four hours to live this is more than the person would have sans space suit me i found a space suit but it was statistically unlikely that i and whomever else has followed suit pun intended would manage to repair our ship before the less than twenty four hours are up yes studies have been done so twenty four hours give or take  about the time i was composing my last words in my head trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like that s when i heard a bell  my first thought i was going crazy twenty four hours of silence vacuum remember was i hallucinating noises now  i heard it again it was a fine bell reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals i d seen in documentaries and accompanying the bell i saw a light  now there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense first the whole in a vacuum why s there a bell thing second i was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship and any conceivable light sources were not within view starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright  these signals were the heralds of my saviors  the first words they said to me meant nothing i wasn t listening i didn t care i was going to live i was going to keep breathing next to those nothing else mattered the recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life giving substances and how breathing was like sex only better i reserved the right to revise this opinion later  when i was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue i looked around the ship it was odd and old either so outdated or so heavily modified that i couldn t tell what make it was and somehow the crew standing around me fit the same description a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk and me i guess i was one more piece in their puzzle i was one more scrap to weld onto the rest one more stranded survivor who was found  i was now one of them  this story it s our story the survivors of the unfortunate accidents the catastrophic malfunctions the fateful crashes this is us floating alone each of us facing the silence of the vacuum we were found  once found we can never be lost  this is our hotel california  we can never leave  “so i m on a ship now you do this a lot ”  a woman introduced as tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful shrugged “now and then ”  “what about my crewmates why didn t you save them ” as much as jesse had irritated me i didn t like the picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave body swollen and bloated who would tell his girl how he had died  “couldn t ” said the captain jefferson he called himself clean shaven and smart a picture of the perfect entrepreneur an opportunist and a businessman that was jefferson “we re selective about our passengers ” he continued “you fit the bill they didn t ”  tiffany she looked at the captain grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder she turned to me “come on ” she said before i could say anything else “let s get you settled in ” no time for questions no time for answers   the ship had all the usual accoutrements artificial gravity tastefully painted walls sound dampeners to keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane recycled air systems and a few less usual lush carpeting lighting that was decorative as well as functional spacious corridors the occasional painting hung on the wall generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met primarily glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways music voices the aroma of real food  this was heaven no seventy two virgins but it would do  “where are we going ” i asked  tiffany looked back “to your quarters it s not far you re not going to get blisters ”  “no i meant where s the ship going what s our destination ”  tiffany she stopped walking she gave me a look pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to share the news “honey ” she said “you re going to be delighted destination everywhere destination nowhere ”  this was hell i died in those last moments suffocating on my own exhaled breath and this this was my reward  fact the speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees celsius or sixty eight degrees fahrenheit is three hundred and forty three meters per second or one thousand one hundred twenty five feet per second  it took me a couple days to realize i was in fact still alive i mean sure i d had my moment of elation when i had first realized i d been rescued but it didn t sink in after watching my ship tear apart after spending a good twenty three hours floating in silence in the wreck wondering whether i was currently facing stars belonging to the constellation libra or the constellation orion when those stars were viewed from earth wondering what it felt like to suffocate and after the feeling that yes i was in fact going to die alone in space had sunk in it took time for that feeling to dissipate  fact i wasn t dead  after i realized this i left my quarters the lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official meals were taking place but i hadn t bothered to acknowledge the invitations it hadn t seemed relevant somehow given that i was still reeling over the explosion the deaths of my crewmates and the rescue i ve heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock i guess i was working my way through them food was delivered to my quarters initially i couldn t figure out why—i hadn t requested any be sent then i realized someone must have noticed i hadn t left and was nice enough to send food my way the accompanying bottle of wine was a nice touch i must have consumed it too because later on the plates and the bottle were both empty i spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling or slumped in the old fashioned armchair staring out the windows at the stars i did a lot of staring and not moving  man was it good to be done with that stage  it was time to find out what hell looked like  fact hell is other people sure the ship was spacious we didn t pick up many passengers—just the select special few scattered here and there between the stars but we were all on this ship and we were on it together  cliques form in any decent sized group of people me i was singled out by sarah an unassuming forty something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the other she sidled up to me as i was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro cream dip onto a plate the plate by the way was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish paprika dusted deviled eggs toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese and balls of meat smothered in a tomato based sauce luxurious even compared to the fare one would find in the high class space stations and pleasure cruisers compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship it was mouthwateringly lip smackingly gorgeous i wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing i decided it couldn t have been  “liking the taste of the sweet life eh i m sarah and this is alexis—you must be the new pickup ” she looked me over approvingly “come on let s get you a glass of champagne ” i looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar but didn t protest  the bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot it turned toward sarah s wave and acknowledged her with a nod moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her i marveled at the robot s smoothness and coordination clearly it was a high end model sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions with alexis trailing after us  i spent the evening listening mostly listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided no one minded sarah s inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter ray a plump man who was grey where he wasn t bald zheng short and dark and lean with a very intense gaze he made me a little uncomfortable kishori petite her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist i categorized them based on their appearances hoping i d be able to pick them out of the crowd again later most of their chatter was meaningless to me—stories of day to day activities how so and so had been seen in so and so s table at lunch and my wasn t that a surprise and why hadn t the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on earth didn t they and this was somehow an interesting fact  after the first half hour i stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight i wasn t learning anything useful i could have started asking questions but i wanted to get my bearings first tonight was for observation i didn t bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people though they all looked the same clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt the hangers on the circle with whom the gossip was shared i wondered at the ship instead all the fine food and the ornamental lighting it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain if the barkeep was any indication i suspected similarly high class robots fulfilled other positions on the ship how they were all powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got a quality robot like that was still an energy sink it was the brain mostly the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources  sarah s crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled all seemingly pleased to have a new set of ears to talk at i slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract film—done in the style of old flatscreen movies—that i had seen during off time at geminia station  by the end of the evening when i finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room a satisfying haze had settled on my mind it was nice i decided this ship this life the nagging questions about where the ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged but somehow seemed less urgent did it truly matter what the ship s origin was and why jefferson had saved me if now i was content  fact it s easy to fall into patterns i would wake late checking the clock on my room s lightscreen to make sure i hadn t slept through brunch i would join the rest of the ship for meals and i would take my turn in the weight room i would watch old films on the entertainment screens taking mental notes for later dinnertime discussions i would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks i would attend afternoon dance classes so that when the evening dances came around modeled after the historical social gatherings of several hundred years prior i would be less of an embarrassment to myself  i did not ask questions i told myself i should i told myself that tonight the observation period would end and i d start puzzling out the ship s mystery but i fell under the ship s sway bereft of my previous familiar life i latched onto kishori and ray and zheng and sarah with alexis dragged along on her arm now and then he was mostly her favorite dancing partner she confided to us one night that his conversational skills left something to be desired i smothered thoughts of friends back on earth—this was my long awaited vacation my clean break and my temporary retreat i d try contacting those friends tomorrow i continued to care little for shipwide gossip but our discussions of films and flicks old and new brought out my artistic story loving argumentative side a side of me i d tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer it was a good life if surreal but i wasn t sure i wanted the dream stage to end  fact some places are timeless days passed weeks passed but i couldn t tell if it had been months or years since i was rescued all there was all i remembered was a blur gathering for drinks in the parlors playing dress up with all the fine clothes i found in the closets some of it modern some of it period dress for special themed events idling in the lounges now and then a new face mingled in the crowd other faces washed out fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines  one of these evenings we were gathered in the south ballroom for post dinner drinks lounging on couches and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor the south was in the title to suggest that there were more ballrooms there weren t sarah s circle had picked up another newcomer adrienne a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on earth let alone work on the ship in whose wreck jefferson had found her maybe it was her curiosity asking a question i should have asked long before that turned the conversation serious maybe there was just something special about that evening maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life hitting some threshold or some breaking point regardless when adrienne asked what the ship s purpose was we all gave it a measure of thought we dredged up half fledged theories and inchoate explanations tossing these out the same way we pitched ideas about the art films  “i believe we ll see the end of the universe ” said tiffany captain s cohort she had a glass of orange brown liquid in one hand it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor she swirled it speculatively i watched adrienne she tilted her head listening not speaking  “impossible ” said zheng sitting in the chair to her left “we can t live that long ”  “maybe the universe will end sooner than you think ” said jefferson yeah the captain was there with the rest of us he didn t drink but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques  “maybe we ll travel at the speed of light and we won t age ” said sarah setting her wine glass on the little round end table by her couch “maybe we re already traveling at the speed of light ”  tiffany she nodded eagerly “relatively says it all ”  zheng scoffed “also impossible even if we were traveling at ninety nine percent of the speed of light—that s assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible because it isn t—we d still age we d just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us ”  “and ” said sarah “aging is relative anyway besides i wouldn t mind being around forever give our ancestors purpose keep their dreams alive ”  “new hypothesis ” suggested kishori slipping into the conversation “no one s immortal in fact the opposite we re all going to die ”  “bleak ” commented zheng “but i like it ” he grinned at sarah who frowned ray took a drink from his glass of ice water and shook his head  “we re all going to die so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have ” kishori gestured to the bar the carpets the paintings “all the luxuries money can buy ”  tiffany took a drink thinking “all the luxuries money can buy ” she echoed  zheng looked skeptical “paid for how ”  “smuggling ” responded kishori matter of fact jefferson snorted amused “think about it ” kishori continued “where else would we get the money to buy all this ”  “renegade smugglers so what s our cargo eh captain ” zheng joked leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine  jefferson shook his head and stood up “i ll leave you to your speculation ” he said a chorus of good nights followed him out the door  after the captain left zheng leaned in he set his glass down on an end table steepled his fingers together “we re revolting ” he told us “and i don t mean that you disgust me no we re the start of a rebellion did you hear what the captain said earlier he means we re going to change the future the universe as we know it won t be the same ”  “that s dumb ” said sarah “wouldn t we know it if we were part of a rebellion  zheng shook his head “the captain selected us for a reason he has inside intelligence—how else would he know where to find us he knows about us ”  “that s still dumb ” said sarah “inside intelligence don t you remember there s not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information ”  “i still like my idea ” said tiffany  me i followed adrienne s example and didn t speak up fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in gather info observation mode though i thought zheng had a point jefferson didn t share how he found people he didn t share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were or why he saved some people but not others but then again no one asked i guess we all figured he knew what he was doing he had been at this savior business longer than any of us i wondered if adrienne would ask about that  “we re going to mean something ” zheng was saying “what we do rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us we re going to leave a legacy ” he sounded certain enthusiastic even  ray he shook his head and broke the quiet he d held most of the evening “you ve got it all wrong ” he looked from sarah to adrienne to zheng to kishori and tiffany to me “obviously we can t last longer than the rest of the universe we aren t giving anyone purpose we re not even going to leave a legacy all we re doing is existing all we re doing is eating and drinking and shitting breathing and fucking and nothing important ever we aren t special ”  “again bleak ” commented zheng adrienne gestured for him to be quiet she leaned forward setting her elbows on the foot stool in front of her  “you never know when it will end ” ray continued not addressing any one of us in particular “you can t hold on forever even if you don t ever ever want to forget how long until the memories slip away how long until all you remember is this the ship the thick red carpeting the chandeliers the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people when your life the reason you lived the people and faces and places the emotions you felt who and what you loved when all that is gone faded what will you have left ”  i wondered how long ray had been on this ship i wondered why if he had such an unpropitious outlook he hadn t tried to change his situation i wanted to ask but he was still talking and i was too self conscious to interrupt  “you can try to hold on ” said ray “you can try and try and try repeat stories to yourself in the artificial night sketch faces in your mind you can make their names your mantra but words if you repeat them enough times lose their meaning emily emily em ill ee em i lee eh mill ee eh mih lee my wife s name once repeat it enough times it s just a sound no longer grounded ”  ray he said “if we last forever if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out it won t mean a thing to us we won t care that we re last and we won t care that there are no more stars we aren t angels we re just dumb and lucky ”  “pure dumb luck ” he said  “struck a nerve huh ” said zheng  “sorry ” said ray  “how long ago was that ” asked adrienne “leaving your wife i mean traveling on this ship ”  ray he looked down at his hands folded together in his lap fingers interlaced “i don t know ” he said we were all quiet for a moment ray shrugged then got up and left we let him go silent self conscious more excuses were made and after a few moments only adrienne and i were left sitting in the ballroom she looked across the circle of couches at me  “what s your theory ” she asked me  i shrugged  “how long have you been here ”  “not that long ” i said “a couple weeks i guess maybe a month or two ”  “why don t you know for sure ” she asked  i shrugged i hadn t been counting days  “what did you do before this how were you found ”  “i was an engineer ” i explained how my ship had malfunctioned no warning at all the explosions the impossible rescue “i don t know how jefferson knew to find me there ”  she nodded “the ship i was on i guess that s what happened too some vital part broke and well boom it was all so fast ” she took a sip of her drink plain water because she had explained earlier she had never liked the taste of alcohol then fixed her gaze on me “i m going to figure it out ” she said “how and why this ship exists i ll figure it out then i m going to find a way home ”  i paced my room that night unable to sleep the more i thought about it the less sense the ship made worse adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question i had spent weeks asking nothing contentedly getting nowhere  fact adrienne intimidated me  fact it s too easy to fall into patterns  i resolved to break the pattern  another evening another chandeliered room another swirl of conversations and dances and hor d oevres another circle of chairs and couches another uncomfortable question  “has anyone ever left ” adrienne looked at each of us in turn  ray exchanged a glance with zheng  sarah frowned “now that you mention it i haven t seen alexis in days i assumed he was indisposed ” kishori nodded in agreement  i looked at ray and raised an eyebrow “what ”  “well ” ray said slowly “people do leave the approximate number of people at any given event is always the same but we see new faces ”  “you re sure it s not just some people being indisposed ” asked adrienne using sarah s phrasing  zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table “keep adding people long enough regardless you get more overall a couple people staying in their rooms even if you switch out the people won t make a difference ” he dropped the pecans back into the dish one by one  “so where do they go ” adrienne focused on zheng  i cut in “maybe a better question is does anyone ever come back ”  ray and zheng exchanged another glance kishori chewed her lip sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink after a moment ray said “i don t think so ”  “are there patterns ” adrienne asked “who leaves ”  again there was an uncomfortable moment of silence i hazarded a guess “you don t notice do you ”  sarah looked indignant “of course we notice but well no one important ever disappears so it doesn t really matter does it ” i could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left and failing no one contradicted her no one offered a different answer  i looked at adrienne mission accomplished our routine insouciance had been disrupted the scales had tipped even when the conversation returned to lighter tones as it soon did i dwelt on adrienne s questions from the looks on my companions faces i knew they were thinking the same  “how long have you been here ”  the question previously posed to me was presented to the rest of our group excluding ray adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill recalling the last time the subject was broached  sarah she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass “a long time got to be months and months at least ”  “you were here before i was ” said kishori “and so was tiffany ”  i looked at zheng he shrugged “time passes in a weird way here i kept track for a while—thirty eight days—but after that i guess i didn t see the point ”  fact some places are timeless  “why not ” asked adrienne  “days don t matter ” he said “the eleventh of a month or the seventeenth whether it s wednesday or sunday summer back on earth or winter it doesn t affect us here ”  tiffany nodded but kishori spoke before the other woman could “why are you so interested ” she asked adrienne  adrienne met her gaze “i don t want to be here forever ”  “but we re not here forever ” objected sarah “remember alexis left ”  “disappeared ” i corrected her “we don t know how or why he left or where he went ”  zheng looked thoughtful he picked up his glass swirled the liquid around took a sip then set the glass back down he glanced around at the rest of us “do you want to leave ” he asked “could you live anywhere else now ”  i spoke up “yes ” i said “i wouldn t miss this much ” no one else said anything i watched adrienne s eyes move from one face to the next  zheng he addressed me again leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense steady gaze “you think that ” he said “but is it true would you be happy back in a normal life working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days ”  i didn t answer  fact it s too easy to fall into patterns  fact i wasn t sure i wanted the dream stage to end  my quarters felt stifling asphyxiating my mind i sat sideways in the armchair feet dangling over one arm neck resting against the other absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as i ruminated on the situation the lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful i inspected the arrays of entertainment options—abstract old style flatscreens engrossing vr flicks and action games a selection of quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity there was a schedule advertising upcoming on ship events such as dance classes craft sessions and discussion groups and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to a menu of display options allowing me to customize all the lightscreen s superficial characteristics a simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship that was all  a methodical search of my two adjoining rooms the ample closet space and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder furniture dark wood expensive polished no secret compartments clothes leftover tray of half consumed food from the previous day s lunch toiletries complete with miniature bottles of sweet smelling apricot honey lotion lightscreen me  i was discouraged and frustrated i wanted to prove to adrienne that i wanted solve the ship s mystery just as much as she did i wanted to find something anything that would prove all this was normal and sane i didn t want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences  i wanted my contentment back  i cornered adrienne at dinner that night in one hand i balanced my plate of star shaped crackers globs of elegant dips and garnishes little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant and an array of other delectable bite sized items my other hand pointedly steered adrienne to a small table against a wall she glared at me but obediently let me pull her along  “tell me ” i said after we sat “what you have found ” it wasn t a question  she gave me a grumpy look that informed me quite clearly of her current opinion of me “not if you re going to be rude about it ”  i sighed “sorry ” i wasn t not really but i d lie to get the conversation going “i want to know ” i explained in two brief sentences my earlier impasse  “i don t know much ” she said still annoyed but at least cooperative she reviewed the information gleaned from our previous dinner conversations adding “i heard the captain say something yesterday as i walking to the pyrope parlor i was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side talking to a couple people and they must not have known i was there he said something about a wreck going well and listen when they came round the corner ray was with the captain ”  the next time the captain stopped by our group tiffany tagging along pretending that she too was a social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone we were ready  “is there a doctor on board ” asked adrienne “i ve been having headaches ” it was a lie but we needed information  jefferson nodded “down past the emerald lounge second door on the left all hours ” a robot then medical ai were even more expensive than the barkeep i wondered how many people it treated had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill  “does he age ” asked adrienne  “the captain ” i shrugged “i never thought about it ”  adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face “that doesn t answer my question ” she said  adrienne only picked at her food  “not hungry ” asked kishori sympathetically  “no ” said adrienne  “at least have a drink ” said sarah “i find it takes the edge off ”  “she doesn t drink remember ” said kishori  “maybe that s the problem ” said sarah  “one hundred and forty seven is a magic number ” said sarah “you ever heard of dunbar well we ve got the perfect size group right here ” just enough for us all to recognize each other just enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other  “why doesn t anyone mutiny ” adrienne asked “if you dislike this place so much why don t you do something about it ”  “we can t ” said ray “what would we do ”  adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust “you could force the captain to set down somewhere let us off the ship if he refuses threaten him if he still refuses well of all of us isn t there someone who can drive a ship ”  “that s murder ” objected sarah  “that s survival ” adrienne corrected her “do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life ”  sarah didn t reply  i shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the emerald lounge looking out the windows at the stars times like that running on less sleep than i should alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night i had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it the stillness of the room contributed as did the view black and more black speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to break the emptiness if only for a brief time all of it was temporary save for the black that was tonight s melodramatic theme the ephemeral nature of life everything temporary everything to fade away lost as dust and scattered atoms between the stars and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born  thinking about that i wondered if sarah s theory was right after all some things in this world we have to make them permanent ourselves and jefferson he had done that he had made us a constant he made this ship—this life—a constant the one thing that was known the one thing that wouldn t change  maybe everything we did all the stories we told maybe it was all lies maybe we d never know each other not truly because we all hid behind the stories creating the realities we wanted to see but ultimately this ship its purpose our purpose—did it matter we each had our own theory maybe that was enough and all of us we were permanent characters in each others stories maybe that made us more real maybe it made us feel less alone  “mind if i join you ”  i turned to see adrienne in the doorway she smiled then crossed the room to join me by the window not waiting for an answer  “some nights ” i said “i can t see the meaning in any of it all these things i do they re just to pass the time until i die ”  adrienne looked at me then back out through the window “you don t see a meaning because there is no meaning ” she said  after all of it as much as we feared being alone we feared being vulnerable even more our instinct was to hide  “look what i found ” adrienne said in her hands was a bottle  and what happens to adrienne  i couldn t find her  jefferson was in the captain s lounge  fact sound is a vibration the speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees celsius or sixty eight degrees fahrenheit is three hundred and forty three meters per second or one thousand one hundred twenty five feet per second  “up his dosage ” i heard the captain say “i ve got a replacement lined up ”  i ran  i didn t want to forget  i didn t want to be harvested  the last thing i remember i was tearing down the corridors life boats i thought every ship had life boats in case of emergency break glass i d find one i d put on a space suit i d get out of this ship i d find civilization again a planet a space station some other ship any place but this place  failing all else i d suffocate alone  ray he caught me as i pounded on the corridor walls finding no glass to break “relax ” he told me sliding a needle into my arm “it ll pass ” he told me he held me in his arms until i stopped flailing  it passed  this is my hotel california  i can never leave

  foster a ranney  nathan’s bylichka  dedicated to neil gaiman radiohead and black sabbath  strange things have always happened to my family it came in through my mother s blood my russian grandmother would always tell me stories bylichkas of ancestors with the second sight stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times when i asked her if she d ever seen them – before i was old enough to stop believing i mean – she would always look sad and tell me no not since the family came to america has anything happened to us but if you ever should see a faerie tell him that you are of the blood of ivan bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly as i got older i shook the tales off with a nod and a yes nana  i got older and went to school then to college and i replaced the dreams my nana gave me with the music djs mixed for crowds in clubs webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything my girlfriend rachel and i would go to the clubs near our school sometimes we d get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges and we d rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up boston is a strange place at night you wouldn t believe half of the shit i ve seen even when i was straight  it was a friday night rachel and i went out to dinner and when we finished she saw that there was a message on her cell phone she checked it there in the restaurant her head tilted into the phone as she listened her pleather purse on her lap shining jet against the worn black of her snug dead can dance t shirt “it’s from mitch ” she said folding up the phone “he says we should meet him tonight there’s a good one going on in that church that closed down last month ”  “i don’t know … it was going to be just us tonight i’m not sure i’m up for a night out ” i was feeling calm and private that night it seemed like tonight’s darkness was small and personal cupped hands offering a place for two not the burning open darkness of a rave  “baby let’s go it’s been over a week and i want to dance let’s go together you know you’ll have fun once you get into it ” she bit the inside of her bottom lip looking at me like i was breaking her poor sweet heart i’m a sucker for that and she knows it  “okay rachel let’s go you’re probably right ”  she grinned and gave me a kiss across the table her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing not just pressing your face into someone else’s  “let’s not get fucked up tonight though okay rache we don’t – ”  “sure babe come on i don’t have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself let’s not waste any more time ” she stood up and i followed her out to the street it was dark enough that i could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light without hearing the car horns i could almost taste the air of late march through the street fumes if it was march that meant that we’d been together almost a year and a half it was last february after the winter break that we moved in together now spring was back under the concrete and i could smell it even here  “isn’t it an amazing night rache even the city feels alive when spring comes ”  “taxi ” she waved down a car and pulled me in in a few minutes we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church after she paid the driver she grabbed my arm laughing and we ran down the street i heard the pulse already we slammed against the doorway and i was laughing too the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest rachel in my arms because she’d used me to soften her landing we kissed and slipped inside  the old vaulted church was stripped down there was no cloth on the altar just a dj’s toolkit and his beer through the dark i could see three bolts left in the wall from where they’d taken down the crucifix a confessional too beaten up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside and where the pews had been taken out a couple hundred people were testifying to the dj’s moving sermon  rachel stepped forward into the crowd while i took a moment to drink in the ceiling’s blue lit shadowed vault and the light catching haze from who knows what rising between the dj and the crowd there was a terrific echo each beat reverberating inside of the next and the old stained glass windows rattled in their frames on the dance floor people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air  i danced with rachel for a while but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes she told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd  when she hadn’t come back halfway through the next song i glanced over at the bar it was just a little set up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share mostly beer rachel was standing with a plastic cup looking like she was having a conversation but i couldn’t see anyone else there the next time the crowd split i saw him he stood in front of a blue light so i couldn’t see him clearly but what i saw was memorable he wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet and his hair gleamed black against his white skin the blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor setting off his striking face without illuminating its details and his wrists flashed white in the darkness he didn’t move just stared and held his drink  the next time i saw them his mouth was moving she nodded and he took her arm i watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong  saturday morning i woke up and saw that she still hadn’t come home i called mitch and our other friends hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses but i had no luck a couple of them remembered seeing her leave but none of them had seen the thin man with her i didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features even in that distorting light  i caught a taxi back to the church it was still a mess but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared i walked across what had been the dance floor the church was completely different now sunlight fell through the stained glass catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry healthy warmth into the edges of the room through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights i realized that rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and i had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up – which if she were in a situation where i should be doing something would probably be never  standing in the center of the church i took out my cell phone and called the police “i need to file a missing persons report …rachel frieze last night walking on west  nd street around – maybe eleven or twelve o’clock what …but sir this is an unusual situation she didn’t come home last night none of her friends have seen her …sir if she’s in any danger it will probably be too late to help her by that time my girlfriend has disappeared i don’t even know where to start looking and i need help …yes sir i understand ” the police wouldn’t file a report for someone who’d been missing overnight i closed the phone  walking out of the church a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise a cold front must have hit while i was inside glancing down the street i realized that i didn’t have a friend to drive me home this time and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran i pulled my t shirt’s sleeves down my arms as far as they’d go but i wasn’t ready for cold  walking didn’t build up much heat it just moved the air enough to chill me more after i’d walked about a block a car rolled up behind me it slowed down as it neared me and i started to worry this wasn’t the best of neighborhoods i kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it  i heard an automatic window roll down “hey ” said a male voice “do you need some help ”  i turned around the man looked over forty and he was driving a car i’d be afraid to drive on this street “it’s a long way to anywhere worth going ” he said “would you like some help ”  “ah i think i’m fine thanks ” i told him and turned back to the sidewalk  “really i’d like to help please hop in you don’t look dressed for this weather ”  i glanced back over my shoulder “no thanks sir i’m just fine really don’t worry about me ”  “nathan spencer i offer you help i advise that you not refuse me a third time ”  i stopped and looked back at him surprised he met my eyes coolly “how do you know my name ”  “i know your family get in we have a lot of work ahead of us and it’s best to start now ”  i walked around the car and got into the passenger seat before i had my belt on we were rolling forward “okay ” i said “i’m in the car now will you tell me how you know my family and how you happened to be driving by just now in fact why didn’t you call me by name the first time and how did you recognize me when – ”  “that’s enough i can only answer one question at a time i know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours i am here now because you called for help and no one else would answer ” he turned onto the next street and shifted up “i will help you find your rachel i have to warn you though you won’t like what i have to tell you ”  i shivered something in his tone couldn’t be disbelieved “tell me anyway if she’s in trouble i want to find her wherever she is ”  my driver took a deep breath as he did his neck stretched in a strange way and i noticed several thin lines like wrinkles running across the sides of his neck “nathan ” he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation “rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet this person like me is not a member of traditional society you see nathan there is …separate from your society …oh damn it i’ve never had to give this conversation before come on i have something to show you ” with that he made a sharp turn onto a side street that i hadn’t noticed before we drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that i couldn’t tell whether they were abandoned my driver turned again next to an old warehouse that i might have been in once when mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year  in front of a few houses there were cars parked but there were almost none on the streets their bumpers looked ready to drop off and their paint was half smog i got a strange feeling that we weren’t supposed to be driving here “hey ” i said “are you sure that we should be going this way i mean – ”  “just ignore that ” he told me “you’ll be used to the sensation in a moment ” that just unnerved me more as we kept driving the anxiety grew more pronounced i noticed that there were some people on the street people the same color as the soiled buildings someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes “okay this is the spot ” said my driver pulling over he parked and got out  “is it really safe to leave the car …” he was already walking toward the squat brick windowed building we were parked next to glancing back at that gleaming glare i decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car i hopped out ran after him and reached him just as he was knocking on the door someone opened it a crack then ushered us in  inside the building opened up the ceiling was high and wooden and i could see part of a dj’s booth down the hall it looked like we were in the back of a nightclub then i looked down and saw what had let us in “nepthys my man what up ” the hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap “nice my man ” he said as they clasped hands “who’s the freak ”  “this is someone from ivan’s family did i ever tell you about them ”  “yeah one time man but you were pretty fucked up what’s your problem kid ”  the hunchbacked man came up to my stomach his skin was brown and stretched like some diseased sapling’s bark it pulled back around his fingertips which bore things that might have been nails or claws when he grinned i saw that his teeth were sharp and small like a hunting cat’s under matted hair his eyes had slit pupils  nepthys quickly answered for me “girlfriend troubles she came down here with someone after a party and i don’t think it was one of your average pixies ”  “bummer so what’s the cat look like ”  he turned to me nepthys nodded “it’s okay you can trust him that’s why we came here ”  it was easier to talk than to question “i …i noticed him from across the room when i was looking around for rachel he was standing right in front of some blue lights so i couldn’t see him very well but i noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin it almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly he was slim almost drawn but he had a kind of … luster to him i guess he wasn’t a person you’d describe with normal adjectives you know ”  they nodded “oh totally ” said the hunchback “i get that all the time around here ”  “he was wearing a sort of jacket …maybe blue velvet i couldn’t tell in the dark but it had ruffles at the throat things like that he really stood out that’s why i couldn’t understand why no one else remembered him he had some rings too i remember that he hardly ever moved just stared at rachel even when he talked he hardly opened his mouth i don’t know how he could’ve been heard over the music ”  the two glanced at each other “what do you think ” asked the hunchback  “i’ve looked into it a little and i do think we might be dealing with one of them have you seen anyone like that in your club ”  “not that i can remember man i can send you to a guy who knows all about them though if this cat’s for real i bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know ”  “you’re a wonder dvorov we should head straight over it won’t be long before nightfall ”  “oh yeah man here let me write down how to find him ” the hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail then handed it to nepthys “here you go man good luck ”  “thanks dvorov i owe you one let’s go ” that last one was to me i waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left he gave me a half hearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing and whether i should be wearing body armor  back on the street i began to see things that i had never looked for until then still in my initial shock i suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadn’t registered when we parked i saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through – people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail the yellow of this sky wasn’t just smog it had a leeching heavy dimness i saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light a corpulent batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle leaning from the rough hewn window of one building on our right was something with long green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill thirty five thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed i noticed when my back hit the wall that i was walking backwards  “we and thousands like us have been living separately as long as there has been a human society ” said my driver i noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills “we interact with humans take advantage of them grant them boons sometimes even become their friends but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction at this point we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional  “the only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours love ins raves gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over and that is where rachel met someone from this world those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this where the human population is so overwhelming that they won’t be noticed in the right corner with the right protective spells ”  he took out the hunchback’s directions and glanced at an alley behind us “okay nathan we should get started right away there’s no time to waste ”  he saw that i wasn’t moving setting an arm on my shoulder he said “nathan what you see here might be frightening but those things you saw are people just like you they’ll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms ”  “thanks it’s very reassuring that i’ll not only be an outsider but a curiosity ”  “nathan you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help rachel well she’s here and she needs your help now the more we can do before nightfall the better ”  “but why are you even helping me until thirty seconds ago i didn’t believe in magic or any of that kind of …weirdness ”  “nathan i told you my family owes yours a debt in this world one’s word is a promise now can we get going ”  i caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye “only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name ”  “you’ve got a deal let’s go ”  as we headed down the sidewalk i said “what is your name anyway ”  “that’s a question you learn not to ask here what you may call me is nepthys ”  holding dvorov’s directions nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway i started wondering again how reliable my guide’s credentials were walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other he did not inspire confidence  “just at this corner ” he said interrupting my immanent panic attack “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er counterclockwise then face east east is that way ” he pointed at the wall to our right “don’t let the sun fool you then i’m going to shed a little blood but don’t worry none of yours ” i blinked at him but he just kept walking until we reached the corner “okay you might feel silly but just turn three times to your left try to keep in time with me ” we spun around three times and then something flashed across nepthys’ hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust the blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground and i jumped back when it had all burnt a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it opening the door “are you coming ”  we slipped through the door and came out not inside the building but on a busy street in a completely different part of town the sky cupping over squat buildings was less yellow here and stands were set up everywhere the way i’d picture a market in the middle east nepthys took us immediately to the right where he led us to a cart filled with herbs spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon rosemary and scents i couldn’t place the thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from alice in wonderland it had the same opium dream wise man quality i’d always given the caterpillar its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart and with its long many shouldered pole of a torso it rose over our heads even while seated its face was small and wrinkled with penny sized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose “would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs ” it asked “there are no finer to spice a meal nor purer to mix a potion please let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs ”  “we’re not here to browse ” nepthys told him “we’d like to see a man about some garlic ”  the thing frowned “we have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart gentle sir if – ”  “you know what i mean please if we could see him we would be much obliged i imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons ”  it hissed thoughtfully “true true step behind the cart and enter through the door there using your left hand to open the door and your right – ” he looked at me “ – to close it ”  “thank you ” nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart  the latch opened under nepthys’ left hand with a clack the door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs at the top was one door we entered  the room held a bed a bookcase and a desk with one chair its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls on the bed was a small ratty man i smelled matted hair and cedar chips he opened one eye when we came in but did not move  “we’re here for information about a vampire ” said nepthys  “oh shit ” i said  “sorry kid –would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual ”  “wait nepthys – you said nothing about vampires frankly i don’t know if we can even doing anything against a vampire there’s an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are are …look are they as bad as people in my world think they are ”  “i don’t know they’re almost as rare here and i’ve never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire ”  “only unsuccessfully right ”  “no those people don’t usually leave stories ”  “oh thanks nepthys for your confidence inspiring tales of experience so they’re probably worse than we think okay that’s great now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an anne rice novel ”  “my plan is that you shut up while we’re trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what we’re actually going up against okay don’t forget she’s your girlfriend now calm down while i talk to this gentleman i can hear your heartbeat from over here ”  i shut up and tried to breathe nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed who had not moved “please accept our apologies as you can see our situation is of personal importance to the young man now may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire it would be a great help to us ”  the little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden room’s tight air finally in a pinched rasp he said “my information is purely for the purposes of a collector i do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm ”  “sir we simply want to discover whether this individual is in fact a vampire if there is any boon that you would have us do in return we would be glad to do it ”  he continued to lie in place still breathing heavily i tried to keep myself calm then with a sigh he said “i have need of a certain stone that i once possessed it would allow me to leave this bed despite my current illness my problem is that it was not made in this realm but by a human and only a human may handle it the herb vendor will tell you where you can find it if you would fetch me this stone i would tell you what i can ”  “of course we will fetch you the stone ” nepthys assured him “you have our thanks ”  outside the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone he told nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street and we set off  when we reached the street i expected some sort of temple or a row of antiquaries or at least a sleazy black market relics merchant instead it looked like we were in the red light district women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys nepthys didn’t need to warn me not to speak to them he took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted like a saint under g d’s light and handcuffed  inside the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive a large woman similarly decorated quickly drifted up to us  “good evening gentlemen ” she said “may i invite you to have a cup of tea ”  “no thank you ” said nepthys “we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer are you the proprietor of this shop ”  “yes ” answered the woman “i am madame entera at your service how can i help you gentlemen ”  “we are here to see about a certain stone ”  she raised an eyebrow “are you well we don’t get many customers asking about that item please walk this way ”  she led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like african tribesmen the next room had mosaics of what could have been rome with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd floppy hats on the other after this we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside  “excuse me ” i said ignoring nepthys’ warning look “but may i ask what is kept in these rooms ”  the woman laughed “why the merchandise of course ” she said  nepthys leaned close to my ear “this is a slave shop ” he explained quietly  the woman paused before another door this one not barred but locked as she brought out the key she said “we deal mostly in fairly mundane trades but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items we’ve had genies indentured sorcerers even golems and the occasional elf this is one of the stranger items though it’s been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it if we only had a human on our staff we could have done so ages ago and sold it off but we have no such luck ” she opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room “here it is ” she said  with a flourish she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire intricate patterns like a czar’s jewelry box crawling down the walls in its center under a spearing white light was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth on which lay a gray plum sized rock  “a marvel isn’t it ” she said “that such a rock could hold so much magic – it’s a wonder ”  “that it is ” nepthys assured her “what would convince you to part with it ”  she considered this looking him over “you wouldn’t give me the human would you no ” she said seeing his expression “that would make the stone rather useless ” nevertheless she gave me what i can only describe as an “appraising glance” i have never felt so appraised in all my life “he looks healthy ” she said “how about a pint of his blood ”  “a pint madame i have his health to consider ”  “half a pint then – and his hair ”  nepthys turned to me “well kid what do you think remember this is your quest i’m not giving my blood ”  “as if i wanted it ” interrupted the woman  “i think it’s a fair deal considering the return ” he told me “but it’s up to you ”  i thought about it then nodded  “marvelous ” cried the woman “one half pint of human blood willingly given and his fine head of hair for the stone ”  she took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping there was a wooden chair where she sat me down and asked me to wait soon she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl which she put on the table beside me “roll up your sleeves ” she told me she opened the bowl and carefully gingerly brought out a fat dripping leech it must have been larger than my finger she laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm the cold thing stretched and cast around with its sucker mouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin i thought that i could feel a slight itching  “they take about a quarter pint each ” said madame entera drawing out another skinny leech “they’re quick too we’ll be done with them before your hair is finished ” then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber  half an hour later i left the room pale and bald running my fingers over my scalp at least the barber hadn’t nicked me madame entera took me back up to the stone’s room where nepthys was waiting by the door “be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it ” the woman admonished nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him “thank you for doing business at our house and i hope to see you again ”  i left not a little unnerved and still woozy from the leeches “come on ” said nepthys “you could use a drink ”  we hit a bar on the next street over “vodka straight up ” nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter “and a bloody mary for my friend make it extra bloody ” when our drinks came he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my bloody mary “that should help ” he said “you could run on empty with a little of that stuff it won’t refill your blood supply but while that’s in your system you won’t even need blood ” he grinned at me “drink up kid ”  i took about half of the bloody mary in one gulp and then ate the celery nepthys slapped me on the back “okay ” i said “now that we’re sitting down can you explain a little more of what’s going on here i mean what is this place really ”  he thought about that “i think that our world is a reflection of yours or yours is a more boring reflection of ours this place is just a little of both in america things are still weird after the european conquest the natives are still here but so is everyone else the europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities we aren’t quite what you’d expect from reading the grimms ”  “what do you mean ”  “okay take elves ” he caught the bartender’s eye for another shot “you figure they’re some lincoln green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory right not in america here they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world too right except it’s worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of society’s lowest rungs some of them actually commit to this society though there’s an amazing dj who’s an elf he has a real ear for it when they do decide to do something for real they’re always the best at it ” he downed the second shot “i am glad to be out of the favor trading scene for half a minute it’s exhausting to talk to those people one wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something so what else do you want to know nathan ”  “i don’t know …hey what about the nature spirits things like that i mean where do the dryads fit in a place like this ”  “if the tree isn’t around the dryad isn’t around it’s as simple as that ”  that made me a little sad they were always my favorite part of the greek myths i read in elementary school “well what about you how did you get to america ”  “my parents came over from russia just like your family my real name is a little more ethnically appropriate but we don’t toss those around in this place they were spirits of a certain branch of the volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary when the russian government dammed the river my parents decided that instead of dying with the river they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected i was born here and i was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river sure i miss having a place to settle down but it’s better than waiting to get dammed ” he took another shot of vodka  “shouldn’t you be going light on the vodka i mean we might have a lot of work ahead of us ”  “are you kidding i can drink like a fish kid we should get going though still woozy ” i nodded “a little walking should get the stuff into your system come on let’s go ”  as we left the bar i asked to see the rock “why ” nepthys asked  “i’m just curious i want to see what a magic stone looks like don’t worry i’ll be careful not to touch it ”  he thought about it then handed me the pouch i undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that i could see the stone inside it looked like a normal river stone a gray oval with a white stripe through it as long as i looked at it it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow  suddenly what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me i almost tripped over him and the stone went flying out of the pouch nepthys tried to grab it but by reflex i caught it first  immediately i felt it grow warm and knew that i had done something very stupid “nathan ” said nepthys “i think that you just did something very stupid ”  “i agree ” i told him the stone was as warm as human flesh now and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stone’s soft heat i don’t know then there was light a kind of rosy glow and i felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air the air around me seemed to still sound and light came in around the corners of my eyes “do you know what this thing does ” i shouted hardly able to hear myself  nepthys was saying something that looked like “i have no idea ” but i couldn’t hear him the light in the corners of my eyes rushed in converging on the rosy glow around the stone and for a moment i was blind then i opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street there was no sign of the stone  “i think i understand why we got that stone from a slave shop ” said nepthys the girl was as soft and rosy as the stone’s glow and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a celtic knot her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles and soft white leather boots held her feet  when she didn’t move i knelt down and put a hand to her brow as soon as i touched her her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist i couldn’t move  “name me ” she said  i opened my mouth to ask for an explanation but nepthys stopped me “don’t name her ‘what did you say ’ okay the next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what she’ll respond to until we figure out how to put her back ”  i was at a loss i’d never named anyone before i thought back to one time when i’d been thinking about raising a family and remembered that i’d always liked the name –  “amy ”  nepthys looked at me incredulously “you awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer and you name her ‘amy’ ” amy smiled at me and let go of my arm but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss  i stood up and amy stood with me “so …back to our garlicky friend ”  “i suppose so ” said nepthys “and you’d better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he won’t care we woke her up ”  we walked back to the herb stand the vendor stared a little at amy his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs  when nepthys opened the little man’s door he rolled over and grinned to see us but when amy walked in he blanched “what ” he screamed “you idiots you woke it up get out of my sight this instant ”  “but …but sir ” i said “are you sure she’s no help to you ”  “not if you named it already you ninny and i’m sure that you have fools get out of my sight now – unless you know how to put it back …i thought as much now leave before i call the rats on you ”  we left nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck “you idiot ” he hissed “do you know how much you’ve set us back i should say set yourself back since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for ” i thought about rachel in the excitement i had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts “you’re just lucky that dvorov isn’t my only contact come on we’re heading out ” he held the door for me and amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs walking outside i was shocked to see that it was already dark “night comes quickly here ” said nepthys quietly as he came out behind me “didn’t i warn you ”  “okay ” he said as we hit the street “we’re going to see another friend of mine first though we are getting you a hat you look ridiculous with a shaved head ” at a nearby stand he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real boston it was a black baseball cap that read “dead can dance” in gold across the front amy liked it i think she still hadn’t spoken since i named her so i wasn’t sure  he took us to a squat long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal the black door opened as we came up to it and a pale man opened the door he was naked but there was nothing to hide his body was hairless and completely smooth i only say “he” because he didn’t have a hint of femininity his eyes were white from behind him i could hear something that sounded like a remix of the cure’s “a forest”  “i’m here to see isis tell her that nepthys is here to see her ”  the man closed his eyes a moment later he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in nepthys walked straight past him and i tried to keep up taking amy’s small hand so that she wouldn’t lag behind i shivered as i walked past the pale man’s blank eyes wondering what they were staring at amy gave my hand a squeeze  nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the building’s façade a vaulted ribbed intestine of a hallway whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic i thought that i saw one rib shift in its setting like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall but when i turned it was still  then there was a door which opened as we approached inside the space opened into a wide square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size in the center was a dais covered with white furs and a young woman surrounded by more pale men these were incontestably male  “nepthys ” said the woman slithering up across the furs to sit up as she rose her robes fell open and i realized that except for what looked like a red silk kimono she was naked – naked and stunning i had an urge to cover amy’s eyes “it’s been years since i’ve seen you please come and sit beside me and introduce your friends ”  “this man is here in search of his lover who was stolen from him in the human world ” said nepthys ushering us toward the woman in silk “the girl is …surprising ” he concluded  “and i am isis ” said the woman offering her hand to me i took it and dropping to one knee gave her fingers a small kiss it seemed appropriate “it is an honor to meet you lady isis ” i said  she laughed liquid alluring alarming “oh precious he has lovely manners nepthys despite his poor taste in hats you may leave out the ‘lady ’ boy i don’t wish to be reminded of how old i actually am ” a wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes “now how can i help the elegantly mannered friend of my nepthys and his surprising young charge i hope i can start by offering some wine ”  nepthys poured out wine for three of us “may i have a little more of what you gave me before nepthys ” i asked “i still feel a little woozy ” he poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me the wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that i recognized from the bar but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth  isis’ nostrils twitched slightly “you’ve lost blood boy this story might be interesting does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved ”  “it was part of the price for this girl who was a rock at the time ” explained nepthys  “i have a feeling that she was worth the trade ” i added amy still holding my hand smiled  “she may be at that ” said isis gazing at her “that sweet small nose and her soft lips – she’d kiss well i should think if gently she has good blood under her cheeks good round breasts too even though they’re small they suit her ” amy didn’t blush and i hoped that she didn’t understand what isis was saying  “she would have been worth it ” nepthys interrupted “if this fool hadn’t accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact he was going to give us valuable information for her ”  “now i understand why you’re here ” said isis “so what do you need to know ”  “you know i wouldn’t come to you if i could get this information another way ” said nepthys apologetically  “mmm ” she replied i couldn’t tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant  “i think that the person who stole the girl we’re looking for might be a vampire isis …you know some way to locate the undead don’t you ”  “i do describe this one to me if i know him i can find him if not you’ll have to bring me something to work with ”  nepthys looked at me i thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin his dark hair the way that light seemed to flow around him as best as i could isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while i spoke and tried not to stare at her full hanging breasts when i had told her all that i could remember she blinked her black lashes and said “i remember him ”  “you do ” nepthys could hardly believe her “that’s amazing ”  “it is i would have sworn to you that he was dead he should be i hope that you can do a better job than the last lot ” she sat up running her hands along her pale round thighs “all right then let me see if i can find him ”  isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands a dark glow coalesced around her palms amy leaned forward looking amazed the glow reflected on her pink face casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat strong cheeks tiny drops of blood began to seep out of isis’ palms as her brow creased her candy lips twisted into a frown the dark glow grew stronger and larger filling the air for about a foot around her hands in her palms the droplets of blood swelled into small pools  the dark glow began to flicker and isis’ frown of concentration became one of worry the pools in her hands grew deeper she didn’t shed a bead of sweat and i didn’t even see her draw a breath but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake the blood in her palms still filling up began to ripple shivers swept through her body and nepthys reached out to touch her but i stopped him he glanced at me with honest concern probably the first honest moment he’d shown me ‘is she all right ’ i didn’t know  her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs she gasped and the dark glow went out taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam isis collapsed on the fur strings cut  now nepthys lunged forward took her by the arms “isis what happened are you hurt ”  she shook her head rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something “what did you say ” asked nepthys  she rolled onto her back her arms crossed tightly over her chest for the first time she looked vulnerable when she finally spoke i had to lean close to hear her “i found your vampire ” she said “but he might know that someone’s looking for him he’s taken great pains to keep himself hidden you should look for him at dvorov’s as quickly as you can ” she turned to me with tired sympathy “i didn’t see a girl with him hurry though and you might find him before he leaves ” a twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants “one of these will lead you out ”  i stood and one of her servants took me and amy to the door i looked back to see nepthys whispering something to her he stood to go but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment i turned back to the door “come on amy ” i said “he’ll be along soon ”  nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall when we got there another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood he offered it to nepthys who opened the box on velvet lining a wooden hammer and two stakes  “mountain ash ” said nepthys “that was very kind of her ” closing the box he paused beside the open door and looked back at me “i really hope we find your rachel ” he said it looked like he was going to continue but then he walked out the door  “i know a quick way to dvorov’s ” said nepthys “i bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me ” in a few minutes we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and dvorov himself was greeting us the pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart  “yo my man nep you got the sucker already ”  “no but we got a tip that he might be in your club have you seen him ”  “here man you’re crazy i haven’t had a vampire here since you and – ” nepthys shot a wicked look at him “anyway long time man ”  “that’s odd do you mind if we check it out anyway i have a real feeling that he’s in here somewhere ”  dvorov glanced over his shoulder a little nervous “i guess man but be quick i don’t want my customers thinkin’ that anything’s wrong you know ”  “of course we’ll be in and out in a minute ” nepthys stepped in and dvorov walked us towards the dance floor  “so did you get anything out of the guy i sent you to ” dvorov asked us  “no he said that his research was purely academic not for hunters ”  “bummer i guess i probably should’ve known though i mean he is kinda tight about that stuff ” he didn’t look very surprised “anyway this is the dance floor man good luck ”  something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before then i saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking  i tried to slip along the edge of the crowd things with scales and claws kept flailing against me pressing me into the wall but i took a breath and kept moving my nose filled with a reek of thick sweat the music began to build and a strobe came on somewhere toward the center of the dance floor i heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second i was back with my family in russia hiding from the cold then i felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that amy was following me i gathered her under my arm dvorov was somewhere behind me too negotiating delicately through his patrons  just in front of me a massive thing slammed into the wall sending up a cloud of granite dust it slumped to the floor and i realized that it was a werewolf its haunches twitched in time to the music as it started to rise a man with thick scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him i thought that my odds were better on the dance floor  holding amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers i started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this i wasn’t sure that i could survive the crush of the crowd a cold thing with countless writhing tentacles fell against me thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose tripping me and clutching at my limbs a woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing then a looming shape to my right fell away and i saw him in a flash of the strobe his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd the creature blocking my vision moved back but i had seen all that i needed to see  a bleeding eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me but i ducked around it and toward the bar i slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before a mountain of wet veined flesh and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm  it was dvorov he pulled my ear down to his mouth “you seen enough man ” he shouted  “yes ” i called back “i saw him he’s sitting right there at the bar ”  dvorov tried to peek through the crowd but it had shifted again and we couldn’t see a thing “i don’t think he’s there ” dvorov shouted to me “it must have been wishful thinking ”  “no i saw him i have to hurry too who knows how long he’ll stick around ”  “listen man he’s not there i’m telling you it’s not even worth checking the bar ” i turned to keep going but he caught my arm again “don’t do this kid it’s a dumb idea even if you did find this vampire cat he’d tear you apart if he got your girl she’s probably dead ” i shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs getting almost to the edge of the dance floor  suddenly amy screamed i whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock dvorov away his eyes were glowing red and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off the dancers near us tried to clear some space he shot back up hardly touching the ground and i kicked him back he jumped at my arm while i was still off balance and i felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself  a heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up on the floor was dvorov’s head separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand it flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with dvorov’s blood  “he wasn’t the only one with a secret or two ” he said by way of explanation “you spotted our boy didn’t you i bet his hide out is nearby too let’s hurry ” he wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip the crowd parted for us  the vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us in a blink of the strobe light he was on his feet and dashing from the room “come on ” shouted nepthys  we chased after him amy keeping up valiantly behind us he bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall and we chased up after him heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held luckily the vampire turned off after three stories he ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors but nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me i called out to amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for dj equipment nepthys urged me on from the back of the room then made a turn out of sight  when i came to the door at the end of the room it looked like it had been torn off its hinges i didn’t imagine that nepthys had done it and it wasn’t without alarm that i ran after him  a black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral the vault rose into obscurity above me and a massive rose window stood ahead of me the panes looked dyed black and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter footsteps echoed through the stone chamber and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere i couldn’t tell how many people were running much less where they were on the steps in front of the altar i saw pale forms and realized that they were rachel and two other women then i heard nepthys shout “nathan behind you ” i whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head leaping like a panther he smashed into the pews behind me and i heard him leap across the rest of the row there was nepthys on the other side of the pews holding the wooden box in his hand he tossed it to me and i just barely had it open before i saw the vampire again turning to face me  i pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes he leapt over the pews soaring like a grasshopper and drew a gleaming knife in midair i dodged but he tossed it and i held the box in front of my face the blade lodged in the wood its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin my arms shook from the force of his throw then he landed heavy beside me and i scrambled to stand his first move pulled out the dagger almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as i held on to the box and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards i dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer ready to drive the ash spike into his heart behind him i saw nepthys running between the pews i braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me i raised the stake he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine the stake went down there was a blur and then my hands were empty and i felt pain under my jaw  two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant then all went numb taste hearing and touch became a single blur and i do not know if my eyes were open my mind began to dissipate but then i felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said “this one’s blood isn’t worth drinking ” hands closed on my neck and i felt my spine crack  i must have fallen to the floor then i could perceive nepthys’ sword flashing over me and i heard steel crack then bone i thought i heard rachel’s voice blearily calling for me then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar  i was content to let myself drift away and i had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when i felt a warm touch on its cheek a girl’s voice soft and almost recognizable spoke “nathan ” i felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected then my eyes opened and amy handed me the hammer and stake  i stood and turned toward the altar the vampire was walking just steps ahead of me i stepped up behind him and raised my hands which almost seemed to be glowing then the stake came down into his back and one two three strikes with the hammer drove it in the vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth  behind me amy was kneeling beside nepthys whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug i pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar  rachel her clothes torn and her face drawn looked like she might cry when she saw me i pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me “my fuckin’ hero ” she whispered 
  the black willow  allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close opening a side drawer he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot after filling his pen allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desk s right hand corner his pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lantern s struggling glow the only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds casting its bone pale glow onto the pine floorboards  allan unfolded another page this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right the lines of letters stepped into their divisions in the shape of a story s outline the loose dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet awaiting tendons muscle and blushing skin allan reviewed the troops all prepared to disembark their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from life abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to be thus upsetting the apple cart of his life s plan clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best  although the concept was a simple one allan thought it had potential besides the public liked a good simple romance perhaps this will be more saleable he thought and began to write  they gazed at each other lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before what about roger she asked knowing that the answer no longer mattered  this is good he thought pausing to raise the low light of the lantern i m almost done and the happy ending is just falling into place i hardly dare to think it but – i may finish this story  as he thought this a sinuous wind encircled the house slipping through the walls to chill him the papers and the lantern s flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on allan s window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door this was no stranger however the twisted ancient thing was older than allan its branches rapping on his window since his childhood its thin drawn fingers framed the bloated moon whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly the great jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author who gazed up through his window s tiny frame with trepidation allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him his pen flickered forth words dancing out from its nib in the author s eye gleamed the lantern s reflection – or was it a reflection for while the lantern s spark shivered in the chill breeze this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owner s pen scratching out the rhythm of the willow s fingers  the frenzied writing ceased at last the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort he held a hand to his forehead eyes closed and face flushed i did it again he thought after all that – so near the end to lose control again his breath returning to its normal rhythms he dared to look at the page before him  his face soft as if caught between a smile and tears he draped his loose cape over her shoulders come darling he whispered where i am to take you one need never think of those left behind  they stepped together into his carriage her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt conveyed as if through her skin the unearthly nature of the rails and reins the wheelspokes they took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting for a few yards they kicked up dust along the roadway then they raised their hooves and took to the air she gaped afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand the new england woods disappeared even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky above them the milky way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached a magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the sky s glory  allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window damn you he cried will you never leave me be shall i never finish a story in peace he pounded his desk in vain cursing the foul muse that drove him  the next day allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well furnished parlor taking a measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass he glanced at his host – a cultured man dressed in a light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with a heavy set of sideburns – who passed him a silver tray  cucumber sandwich  allan took a sandwich between his fingers thank you arthur  arthur replaced the tray onto the lacquered cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber in a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial he refilled their glasses how is the writing these days my dear mr clemm  perfectly dreadful my dear mr mason allan sighed i had a perfect story in my pages my hero returned home and reclaimed his love i nearly had it tied together before…  before  before that blasted impulse came over me and i started writing like edgar poe – though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others thank heaven  arthur s face assumed a long suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation i m not familiar with mr poe s works but i assume you re referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic  it s far from a penchant arthur this is more like a compulsion a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment then leaps and takes ahold of me screaming out through my quill  how perfectly awful arthur grimaced at the vivid description i m sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption  i know allan replied but how am i to do that you know i do not wish to make my stories thus but it is my nemesis confronting me anew at every turn  arthur raised a critical brow perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal and believe me allan you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish there simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience at least  it is true allan admitted fidgeting with his cufflinks that i would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher i ve even tried rewriting the corrupted sections but once my characters have gone down that road nothing can recall their former life my prodigal ink blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road  arthur sighed and sipped his wine if only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours you might write something really worth reading it s hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd  allan hung his head holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees his hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night and his clothing had a rumpled look as if by mere proximity it had taken on the aspect of his weariness he scratched the back of his dark haloed head and blinked bleary eyes i would drive it out he said softly but i fear for what would remain  perhaps you require a rest from writing suggested arthur you might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat improve your disposition  perhaps it would allan replied rising and vainly straightening his suit i shall consider it in the meantime however i must be off you have been a gracious host as always  arthur rose and shook his hand so dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home he said i hope soon to see you in better sorts  they parted and allan made his way pensively from arthur s gate he walked the wheel ruts hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust some quarter mile from arthur s gate he halted confronted by a halloo nathan he called out to the empty road  the reply came from above him and allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree i had a hunch you d be at arthur s today said nathan so i thought i d wait here for you nathan s lanky frame dressed in a loose tan jacket fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton his hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface infusing his body with a rakish energy so allan said nathan unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside how goes life for the quintessential american author  i wouldn t know replied allan dryly before continuing in another tone entirely i destroyed another story last night nathan  leaning against his tree nathan shook his head you mean finished another story  yes it is finished ended never again shall it see the rosy fingered dawn nathan you ve read these abominations of mine you know just as well as i that they have no future no potential at best they are faery tales at worst expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see  so instead you would write – what  something saleable something worth reading worth writing i want to write as others do a tale set in our real world of characters who might live therein not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars  why is that more desirable than what you write today  people will read such stories they are worth publishing  if you never finish such stories how can they be worth publishing  that is precisely why i must excise this malignant instinct  why do you write  …why – to earn a living i suppose why do you ask  you choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter though you face such difficulty why is that  i suppose it is because i enjoy my craft i would not be happy thus separated from it  so at its heart then your writing – as opposed to working otherwise – is for yourself  yes i suppose one could see it thus but really nathan your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level  ignoring the statement nathan continued your writing is for you allan not for the publishers or some imagined audience since you seem unable to write normally why not embrace your tales as they are leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure your stories strike a chord with the deepest most ancient stories of mankind the tales basic to humanity tell them and they will create an audience you need not pander to what you imagine their wants are speak and they shall listen  allan crouched over his desk once more pen in hand and mind blank he contemplated a story an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago he had filled his pen and raised it the nib descending towards the paper before the sound came the gentle persistent tapping of the gnarled primeval willow touching the window with long insistent fingers  his eyes awoke with a passionate determined flame though the only light came from the glutted moon allan filled page after page the words escaping from his mind onto the paper where before they had marched in regiments practiced in ranks and followed their leaders commands the words now escaped in their true forms unhindered by any stricture he continued long into the night until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow raised perpetually skyward  arthur looked up from the results of a night’s frenzied labors and looked allan in the eye  what is this he queried indicating the pages he held in his left hand  i decided that… since i wasn t having much success with more – traditional – stories i might see what sort of work i produced if i let my imagination go freely allan replied somewhat less self assured than he had been the previous night  what in g d s name could have possessed you to do such a thing cried arthur nearly raising his voice after all i said the day before why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some self indulgent fantasy he shook the papers at allan raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son this is nothing but a glorified grimm s tale a miscarried child of stoker a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant he spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from arthur s throat do you hate the modern system of literature do you personally despise the works the enlightenment or the progress made since shakespeare  for a moment allan could hardly do more than shake his head no of course not… i–  then why arthur barreled on do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble this morbid paganistic drivel why do you disregard my warnings my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption this literary debauchery he glared at allan eyes impaling him and demanding a response  could you write decent tales with that willow at your window allan cried out at last stepping forward and casting his arms open confronting arthur with this demanding pleading interrogation its twigs rap constantly against the wall the wind always demanding my attention how could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door  arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was arthur mason a tree a tree forced you to write this my dear mr clemm i must admit this seems far fetched even by your standards – even your nathan might have difficulty believing you  you don t know what this is like said allan shaking his head nathan would understand completely even as he said it allan prayed that his statement was true  very well said arthur then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you if you insist on abandoning me i shall not hold you with that he tossed the papers at allan and left the room  stunned allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order he then turned and left through the door opposite that arthur had taken making his way past his host s doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards nathan s residence several miles away  nathan read the package of words in silence his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages allan sat nervously across from him in a chair nathan had probably upholstered himself a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period at long last nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them allan leaned forward unconsciously  it s the best story you ve ever written  allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts so he asked you don t think it s a waste of ink and paper a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery  heavens no said nathan aghast this is one of the strongest works i ve read in ages it speaks to the deepest storyteller s instinct within us all yet is entirely original my dear friend you have done it oh they may rail against you at first they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage but while those in power say such things others will read your tales and see their true worth believe me when i say that you will be read a century from now  allan though dubious as to that possibility felt some temptation from the compliment mainly it granted him the encouragement he still needed nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and allan left it with him then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face he felt now that perhaps nathan was right although the man was somewhat peculiar he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight certainly it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them his mind s strangest fruit had ripened at last and he found the taste less bitter than expected these thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home  it was evening and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last passionate fiery colors filled the western sky before him though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead as allan drew closer he distinguished a new cloud a pillar rising directly ahead a road of smoke ascended in the west its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door  allan s thoughts fled as one scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume he ran the last distance crested the hill puffing to reveal arthur below walking to the carriage parked before allan s house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicle s roof arthur paused in the door looking up at allan for a moment then he turned and shut the door behind him the driver snapped the reins and set the horses on as they trotted forth allan s eyes remained trapped by the carriage following it up the hillock and past himself the heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows he watched as the carriage drew still more distant the horses hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway  when they had gone he remained stunned until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself he turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done  rounding the corner he saw a great bonfire a mass of flaming wood stood before him heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house it was a moment before he realized what else had changed near the wall beneath his window was a stump with black and ancient bark  in a thoughtless panic allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre his thoughts were not of the act s futility nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing instead all that filled his mind was the tree s constant presence in his life growing with him and beside him its persistent reminders that he had higher truer things to write the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake his handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn burning logs but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers  but he did not weep instead he bethought himself of the loss of the tree considered also arthur s motivation and whether some good might not come of this after all leaving the circle of ashes he stood and turned towards the woods in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood he stepped slowly beneath the branches a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great swirling eddy a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willow s last breath  allan wandered beneath the trees for a time thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate he considered arthur s intervention considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested to write stories that others would read for after all what purpose writing if not to be read and without that torturous willow he might be free to write whatever he saw fit indeed if he still could not he could at any time follow arthur s advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind he found himself along the bank of a low wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current as it turned to the deeper woods elder giants rose above him a beech smooth bark a gray green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark cracked trunks of the nearer trees great pines a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three stroke symbol of the british king a towering black birch leaves impossibly high above him as the stream wound its way through the largest pines grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings allan continued slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants there was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass  emerging from between the antediluvian trunks allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped before him roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream grew a stand of black willows fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers sprang up where branches reached the ground though the elders trunks fell and died their children first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead continued unabated a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors  allan stumbled forward jaw slightly slack until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted three trunked willow whose waists were each larger than allan himself collapsing at its base allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream flowing through the ground beneath them

sir head  p i am writing in response to your request for additional information in block   of the accident report form i put poor planning as the cause of my accident you asked for a fuller explanation and i trust the following details will be sufficient am a bricklayer by trade on the day of the accident i was working alone on the roof of a new six storey building when i completed my work i found i had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of    lbs rather than carry the bricks down by hand i decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor securing the rope at ground level i went up to the roof i swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it then i went down and untied the rope holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks you will note in block    of the accident report form that i weigh    lbs due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly i lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope needless to say i proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building in the vicinity of the third floor i met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed this explains the fractured skull minor abrasions and the broken collarbone as listed in section   of the accident report form slowed only slightly i continued my rapid ascent not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley fortunately by this time i had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope in spite of the excruciating pain i was now beginning to experience at approximately the same time however the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel now devoid of the weight of the bricks that barrel weighed approximately    lbs i refer you again to my weight as you might imagine i began a rapid descent down the side of the building in the vicinity of the third floor i met the barrel coming up this accounts for the two fractured ankles broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body here my luck began to change slightly the encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when i fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked i am sorry to report however as i lay there on the pile of bricks in pain unable to move i again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and i had to lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me this explains the two broken legs i hope this answers your inquiry  p   head type title deep thoughts from comedian steven wright head  p a bus station is where a bus stops a

   ussrsos  some new information has come to light over the kursk disaster for those with short attention spans the kursk was the submarine that blew up and sank in the arctic ocean killing all     on board the russians tried to blame the incident on a collision with an unidentified object however sonar tapes which recorded the blasts a small one at first then a much larger one two minutes later cast doubt on these claims a whistle blower within the russian military has leaked that the crew of the kursk was testing a new type of torpedo when the accident occurred it seemed very likely that the test didn t go quite as planned while rescue efforts to save the survivors of the kursk failed salvage crews were able to recover a black box from the submarine which recorded events leading up to the explosion as luck would have it we managed to obtain a copy of those tapes it turns out that the submarine crew was trying to load microsoft windows on their fire control computer their intent was to replace the aging cp m operating system with the flashier windows os apparently the russians didn t know about the legendary stability problems exhibited by windows the log tapes make this painfully obvious   captain is the new fire control windows os installed yet seaman almost sir we just need to finish filling out the registration card captain excellent soon we will be able to point

can be dangerous yes grass snakes not rattlesnakes a couple in sweetwater texas had a lot of potted plants and during a recent cold spell the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze it turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants and when it had warmed up it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa she let out a very loud scream the husband who was taking a shower ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was she told him there was a snake under the sofa he got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it about that time the family dog came and cold nosed him on the leg he thought the snake had bitten him and he fainted his wife thought he had a heart attack so she called an ambulance the attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and started carrying him out about that time the snake came out from under the sofa and the emergency medical technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher that s when the man broke his leg and why he is in the hospital the wife still had the problem of the snake in the house so she called on a neighbor man he volunteered to capture the snake he armed himself with a rolled up newspaper and began poking under the couch soon he decided it was gone and told the woman who sat down on the sofa in relief but in relaxing her hand dangled in between the cushions where she felt the snake wriggling around she screamed and fainted the snake rushed back under the sofa and the neighbor man seeing her laying there passed out tried to use cpr to revive her the neighbor s wife who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store saw her husband s mouth on the woman s mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches an ambulance was again called and it was determined that the injury required hospitalization the noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him so she assumed he had been bitten by the snake she went to the kitchen brought back a small bottle of whiskey and began pouring it down the man s throat by now the police had arrived they saw the unconscious man smelled the whiskey and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred they were about to arrest them all when the two women tried to explain how it all happened over a little green snake they called an ambulance which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife just then the little snake crawled out from under the couch one of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it he missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table that was on one side of the sofa the table fell over and the lamp on it shattered and as the bulb broke it started a fire in the drapes the other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog who startled jumped up and raced out into the street where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it on fire meanwhile the burning drapes had spread to the walls and the entire house was blazing neighbors had called the fire department and the arriving fire truck had started raising his ladder as they were halfway down the street the rising ladder tore out the overhead wires and put out the electricity and disconnected the telephones in a ten square city block area time passed both men were discharged from the hospital the house was re built the police acquired a new car and all was right with their world about a year later they were watching tv and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night the

account of the funds needed to honour it i refer of course to the automatic monthly deposit of my entire salary an arrangement which i admit has only been in place for eight years you are to be commended for seizing that brief window of opportunity and also for debiting my account with    by way of penalty for the inconvenience i caused your bank my thankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has caused me to re think my errant financial ways you have set me on the path of fiscal righteousness no more will our relationship be blighted by these unpleasant incidents for i am restructuring my affairs in      taking as my model the procedures attitudes and conduct of your very bank i can think of no greater compliment and i know you will be excited and proud to hear it to this end please be advised about the following first i have noticed that whereas i personally attend to your telephone calls and letters when i try to contact you i am confronted by the impersonal ever changing pre recorded faceless entity which your bank has become from now on i like you choose only to deal with a flesh and blood person my mortgage and loan repayments will therefore and hereafter no longer be automatic but will arrive at your bank by cheque addressed personally and confidentially to an employee of your branch whom you must nominate you will be aware that it is an offence under the postal act for any other person to open such an envelope please find attached an application contact status which i require your chosen employee to complete i am sorry it runs to eight pages but in order that i know as much about him or her as your bank knows about me there is no alternative please note that all copies of his or her medical history must be countersigned by a justice of the peace and that the mandatory details of his her financial situation income debts assets and liabilities must be accompanied by documented proof in due course i will issue your employee with a pin number which he she must quote in all dealings with me i regret that it cannot be shorter than    digits but again i have modeled it on the number of button presses required to access my account balance on your phone bank service as they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery let me level the playing field even further by introducing you to my new telephone system which you will notice is very much like yours my authorised contact at your bank the only person with whom i will have any dealings may call me at any time and will be answered by an automated voice by pressing buttons on the phone he she will be guided through an extensive set of menus   to make an appointment to see me   to query a missing repayment   to make a general complaint or inquiry   to transfer

a later date to the contact   to return to the main menu and listen carefully to options   to    the contact will then be put on hold pending the attention of my automated answering service while this may on occasion involve a lengthy wait uplifting music will play for the duration this month i ve chosen a refrain from the best of woody guthrie  oh the banks are made of marble  with a guard at every door  and the vaults are filled with silver  that the miners sweated for after twenty minutes of that our mutual contact will probably know it off by heart on a more serious note we come to the matter of cost as your bank has often pointed out the ongoing drive for greater efficiency comes at a cost a cost which you have always been quick to pass on to me let me repay your kindness by passing some costs back first there is the matter of advertising material you send me this i will read for a fee of    page enquiries from your nominated contact will be billed at   per minute of my time spent in response any debits to my account as for example in the matter of the penalty for the dishonoured cheque will be passed back to you my new phone service runs at    cents a minute even

parenthetical remarks however relevant are unnecessary   parenthetical words however must be enclosed in commas   it is wrong to ever split an infinitive   contractions aren t necessary    do not use a foreign word when there is an adequate english quid pro quo    one should never generalize    eliminate quotations as ralph waldo emerson said i hate quotations tell me what you know    comparisons are as bad as cliches    don t be redundant don t use more words than necessary it s highly superfluous    profanity sucks    be more or less specific    understatement is always best    exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement    one word sentences eliminate    analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake    the passive voice should not be used    go around the barn at high

sentences as of    or more words to their antecedents    writing carefully dangling participles must be avoided    if any word is improper at the end of a sentence a linking verb is    avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky    everyone should be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing    always pick on the correct idiom    the adverb always follows the verb    and

  even more proving rape   chatterbox feels that the wall street journal editorial page s coverage of juanita broaddrick s rape charges against bill clinton see  proving rape more proving rape as well as michael kinsley s  readme column in the current issue cries out for the introduction of the scientific method into the usually mushy business of assessing press responsibility with that in mind chatterbox hereby inaugurates the intellectual dishonesty henceforth to be known as the indis index here s how it works publications that refuse to acknowledge  even if to refute the importance of highly significant but inconvenient facts in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one point for the initial offense they will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or internet posting after the first offense is noted by chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow up without making note of said inconvenient fact publications receiving a score of    will be inducted into the indis hall of fame publications that get all the way up to    will be faxed a likeness of joseph stalin chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase  intellectual dishonesty because it s pompous and falsely suggests that only intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest but chatterbox doesn t know any other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of offense   for the purposes of this survey the wall street journal will be counted as a separate and distinct publication from the journal s editorial page because in essence it is   the journal editorial page continues not to acknowledge that norma kelsey the friend and employee to juanita broaddrick who is one of two people partially corroborating broaddrick s rape accusation is the daughter of a man whose murderer was pardoned by gov bill clinton a responsible account of the whole controversy in today s new york times reports that kelsey says the pardon had nothing to do with her corroboration the journal editorial page gets one point for failing to note the pardon in its initial op ed by dorothy rabinowitz on feb    because it has published three times since the initial omission it scores an additional three points and because it published an editorial feb    taunting the rest of the press for not following it on the story and still didn t mention the pardon it scores an extra two points that comes to a total of six chatterbox feels certain that the journal editorial page will provide some follow up tomorrow to tonight s nbc broadcast of its own broaddrick interview which means that if the journal editorial page continues to take no action it will be in the indis hall of fame by monday at the latest   chatterbox considered but rejected the idea of awarding rabinowitz bonus points for having eventually convinced broaddrick to grant an interview to the new york times as the times reports in today s story but the scientific method does not permit any tinkering with the indis index s scoring procedures and besides rabinowitz s efforts on the times behalf weren t really unethical just puzzling given the two newspapers intense rivalry when chatterbox asked the journal s dc bureau chief alan murray who exercised good judgment in not breaking the broaddrick story and full disclosure is chatterbox s former boss to comment about a journal employee s feeding sources to the times he replied i don t really have any comment on what the edit page did they do their thing we do ours which is what journal news employees are instructed to say whenever the editorial page causes them cringing embarrassment   for her part rabinowitz explains to chatterbox that her efforts on behalf of the times were more indifferent than the times made them sound ms broaddrick told me sunday that a times reporter had appeared at the house in the a m and that she had refused an interview rabinowitz writes in an e mail message i asked her why she had decided to talk to the new york post s steve dunleavy and refused a times reporter she said dunleavy caught her by surprise she asked if i thought it would be all right to talk to the times reporter i told her it would be certainly as all right as talking to dunleavy she said well i m sorry i didn t she said she would if he called again i passed this on to times reporter felicity barringer during our second day s interview chat so that s how it happens that in the new york times piece today i m described solemnly as having eventually convinced her to repeat the story to the new york times   timothy noah  
  husbands and wives   chatterbox feels a little dense for not realizing sooner that the subtext  and hence much of the appeal of a hillary clinton rudy giuliani senate race would be wronged wife vs neglectful husband by running against giuliani who has been reported in vanity fair to have a mistress he denies it and by all accounts has a sham marriage the first lady could exact symbolic revenge on her philandering husband while advancing the fortunes of the democratic party at the same time that s almost enough for chatterbox to jump on the hillary for senate bandwagon   the media conventional wisdom is that giuliani would make hillary clinton s marital problems a major campaign issue giuliani makes ken starr look like a patsy cried time this week but er wouldn t that be kind of a risky strategy given his own problematic union many have already opined that the mayor is too vituperative too much of a loner to practice the congenial teamwork oriented politics of the senate other doubters have pointed to his hardhearted uncaring social policies the last thing he needs is to draw more attention to these qualities in his personal life   giuliani s estrangement from his wife donna hanover is made clear in an interview with hanover that appears in today s new york times hanover would not say whether giuliani would run for the senate whether she would like him to run for senate or whether she would campaign for him if he did but she did say in the interview which was conducted before the recent frenzy of speculation about hillary rodham clinton s interest in the same new york senate seat that mrs clinton is a very interesting person i think she s dynamic and i think she s very smart and she s an amazing speaker ms hanover said and for a punch line ms hanover s press secretary joannie danielides said this week that ms hanover had no comment on mrs clinton s potential senate campaign does she have any comment on whether ms hanover plans to be hillary clinton s campaign manager   indis index  update nbc in its juanita broaddrick broadcast last night turned up an additional three witnesses who recall being told by broaddrick in the late     s that bill clinton raped her this diminishes slightly the significance of norma kelsey s possible motives in verifying parts of broaddrick s story one of the three is kelsey s sister whose motives can be similarly questioned the other two heard broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip as only kelsey and broaddrick s husband claim to have however chatterbox notes that nbc like every other responsible news organization that s covered this story reported that norma kelsey s father s killer was pardoned by gov bill clinton and remains perplexed that the journal editorial page won t its indis index is today up to seven   timothy noah and jodi kantor  
  the entrepreneur is the new madonna   dear joe   i know what you mean about being a journalist almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier i often feel as if i only get half the story sometimes so i typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than i will ever need i think that is why i welcomed doing a book it gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism   think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public much of it of course using the standards of top newspapers cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating although it certainly could make for some very good stories i often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era probably decades and decades hence as it is too close in any case there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons i would posit that bill and michael and steve and jerry have become the madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur   so the shift in the image of gates has been an interesting one for me to watch the smart boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully i personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of microsoft on just one man at aol for example there was a conscious effort to develop other  characters for lack of a better word so there while you think of case you also think of pittman and leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives steve ballmer of course is now getting a lot more attention at microsoft but it still seems to be bill s show over there   while i did not attend the trial i was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches several of which made me spit up my lunch laughing it certainly seemed as if the image of bill gates took a beating and the insular culture of microsoft did not look so good that s ironic since i think it was just that insularity that helped them much in the same way that aol has benefited from being in the virginia suburbs rather than in silicon valley aol would never have existed if it had been founded here i am sure since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati out in the d c area they looked positively exciting next to all the government oriented contractors i wonder if that means geography is destiny and it s still location location location   from where i am sitting i think the microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age i think it almost does not matter what the judge does since it s clear that the balance of power is shifting again although it not clear where it will land will the strongman of the era be aol at t microsoft or one of the big media companies or will it be none of them because the internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate   i always use two simple words when people tell me that one company whether it is aol or microsoft or disney is in charge of all our destinies babylon was that incredible empire dominated the world and i imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empire s grip on humanity but we all know how that story turned out   now i am getting way too philosophical but this is my final missive so why not perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going as for me i ll stick with my philosophy of reporting and i guess life nobody knows   cheers kara

  stephanopoulos analyzes his own crime   there was former clinton aide george stephanopoulos on abc s this week this morning furrow browed and heartbroken with all the evidence coming out against the president last week when the lewinsky story was only a few hours old stephanopoulos popped up on good morning america to demonstrate his concern these are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the president there s no question that if they re true they  could lead to impeachment proceedings   is chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about stephanopoulos eager show of independence from the president the problem isn t so much his disloyalty political figures turn on each other from time to time for good and bad reasons we re used to it stephanopoulos wants to run for the senate and doesn t want to seem a clinton stooge by lending credence to the lewinsky charges and treating clinton s familiar defenses as the lies and half lies they seem to be stephanopoulos shows he s not a fool   the trouble is that stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place during the      campaign when gennifer flowers first brought clinton s philandering to public attention stephanopoulos as clinton s chief spinner distracter and all around bullshit artist played a crucial role in discrediting flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth namely that clinton had a disturbing zipper problem don t say stephanopoulos didn t know again he s not a fool simply put stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments   the      documentary the war room captures some of his efforts on tape early in the film with the flowers crisis in full bloom sam donaldson interviews stephanopoulos who blames it all on the republican attack machine gov clinton has no character problem stephanopoulos declares donaldson suggests that on    minutes clinton had admitted to infidelity he said he had problems in his marriage says stephanopoulos correcting donaldson s deviation from the pre scripted fudge phrase of the day  today of course the president s defenders claim that clinton admitted infidelity on    minutes and that the fully informed voters simply didn t care   near the end of the war room stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of clinton paramours which he is about to publicize stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet you would be laughed at he tells the caller i guarantee you that if you do this you ll never work in democratic politics again nobody will believe you and people will think you re scum   you might say that stephanopoulos helped invent the philander protection techniques that seem to have made clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught he was one of clinton s principal enablers to use a word employed by maureen dowd in today s new york times when democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of clinton they don t need to look much further than the big lie about philandering that stephanopoulos carville and a cooperative campaign press corps helped to put over in   now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and abc news analyst it s as if roy cohn went on television in the mid   s to soberly rue the damage wreaked by sen joe mccarthy without any apology for his own role much has been made of the way famous wrongdoers e g dick morris marv albert rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture but usually at least a nanosecond of contrition is required stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the country if clinton as is now increasingly clear was a time bomb waiting to explode then stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the white house and muffled the ticking  
  fetal viability   viability has become the focus of the abortion debate last week the senate rejected majority leader tom daschle s bill banning the abortion of viable fetuses but william bennett and william safire hailed daschle s bill as the great compromise that might settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion forty one states already restrict the abortion of viable fetuses what is a viable fetus how is the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of abortion   roe vs wade the      case legalizing abortion made fetal viability an important legal concept the supreme court ruled that states cannot put the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the fetus is viable the court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged life outside the mother s womb it said this included fetuses that doctors expected to be sustained by respirators the court accepted the conventional medical wisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of a pregnancy the third trimester sometime between the    th and    th week a pregnancy usually lasts    weeks because the point of viability varies the court ruled it could only be determined case by case and by the woman s own doctor even if the fetus is viable the court said states could not outlaw an abortion if the woman s life or health was at stake   justice sandra day o connor argued in a      decision that roe was on a collision course with itself she said that improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy allowing states greater opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion and this seems to be the case up to a point doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the    rd week a week earlier than was thought    years ago most hospitals will only perform abortions through the    nd week of pregnancy   but no baby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the    nd week babies delivered during the    nd and    rd weeks weigh just over a pound their lungs have barely formed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale circulation depends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones a baby born during the    nd week has a      percent chance of survival and about half of these survivors are brain damaged either by lack of oxygen from poor initial respiration or too much oxygen from the ventilator neonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the    nd week because before then the lungs are not fully formed  probability of survival increases for babies born later in pregnancy    percent in the    rd week    percent in the    th week    percent in    th week by the    th week when a newborn doesn t require a ventilator to breathe it has a    percent chance of survival and only after the    th week do the risks of long term brain damage begin to substantially subside because premature babies depend on technology survival rates vary based on access to that technology for instance in rural communities which commonly lack expensive infant intensive care units survival rates in these early weeks are much lower   doctors assess a fetus s viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs have formed sonograms allow doctors to estimate the fetus s weight which correlates with the lungs development and to look for signs such as the development of functioning eyelids and creases in the skin that coincide with the onset of a functioning respiratory system none of the methods for predicting viability are very precise   despite important supreme court decisions since modifying the doctrine of roe the court s thinking about fetal viability has remained fairly constant the only significant revision came in the casey decision      which made viability even more important the court said that state laws could require a woman and her doctor to perform tests to prove that a fetus is not viable before she obtains an abortion   forty one states now have laws restricting post viability abortions some allow doctors to decide for themselves if the fetus is viable some require doctors to perform tests to prove a fetus is pre viable and require multiple doctors to certify the findings eleven states have banned the procedure called intact dilation and extraction ide also known as partial birth abortion in the belief that this procedure is used mainly post viability  banning ides nationwide is a major goal of the pro life movement movement adherents claim that the ide procedure in which delivery is induced the fetus s skull is crushed and its brains are suctioned amounts to infanticide barring this procedure is also the only regulation of abortion that public opinion polls say has a majority of support pro choicers say the ban on ides is inconsistent with roe because the procedure can be used to abort pre viable fetuses   some medical ethicists and constitutional scholars say that the supreme court was wrong to create the pre viability post viability distinction in the first place why they ask does the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vast medical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortion debate the fetus s own claim to human ness and a woman s right to control her body even if viability is an important moral line is it drawn in the right place keeping alive a baby born in the    nd week costs several hundred thousand dollars and usually fails regardless of the effort   the fuss over post viability abortions ultimately concerns only a very small number of procedures less than one percent of all abortions performed take place after the    st week in      only       abortions were performed after the    th week  
  red pants     while writers whose business it is to be witty often fail to produce grave authors occasionally are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their minds from a lifetime of undisciplined reading with innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind i have gleaned a harvest of what i am pleased to denominate red pants items a sampling of which follows my designation derives from a splash of vivid writing in francis thompson s a corymbus for autumn in which he proclaims how “day s dying dragon” was   panting red pants into the west   in this trousers category thompson must share the limelight with coleridge by virtue of the line in kubla khan   as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing   even shelley may stake a claim if only in the pajama division of this sector thanks to his description in epipsychidion of how    the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep   since everthing is to be found in shakespeare it is not surprising that on at least two occasions the board has contributed his own red pants nuggets in antony and cleopatra act iv scene viii lines    et seq antony commands the wounded scarus to    leap thou attire and all through proof of harness to my heart and there ride on the pants triumphing   and in othello act ii scene i line    cassio utters the fervent prayer that othello might   make love s quick pants in desdemona s arms   a variation on this theme occurs in alba de céspedes the secret translated from the italian by isabel quigly simon and schuster new york      page     where she confides that “i still had a whole afternoon before me to spend and i used it to tidy up my drawers ” one may well wonder what miss stowe had in mind when in uncle tom s cabin chapter she narrates how “mrs shelby stood like one stricken finally turning to her toilet she rested her face in her hands and gave a sort of groan ” in this same vein the mirthless milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of nations when in describing mount etna in book i of paradise lost lines       he penned   and leave a singed bottom all involved with stench and smoke   and in chapter vi of vanity fair when blenkinsop the housekeeper sought to console amelia for joe sedley s jilting of her dear rebecca thackeray confides  indelicately that amelia wept confidentially on the housekeeper s shoulder “and relieved herself a good deal ”   chuckles often emanate from the british employment of a term in a sense at variance with american usage there is that oft quoted example near the opening of trial by jury where defendant asks “is this the court of the exchequer ” and having been assured that it was defendant aside commands himself to “be firm be firm my pecker ” the british of course do not giggle at this bit of gilbertian dialogue since to them pecker means courage as in the phrase “to keep your pecker up ” two of the more common examples of british american divergence of usage are screw and knock up in vanity fair chapter    the niggardly sir pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat your american sophomore might fancy him to be when he “screwed his tenants by letter ” he was simply making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees similarly when in chapter xxxiv of the same novel mrs bute reminds her husband that “you d have been screwed in goal bute if i had not kept your money ” she was not speaking of pleasures deferred in bleak house chapter xxvii grandfather smallweed referring to mr george warns mr tulkinghorn that “i have him periodically in a vice i ll twist him sir i ll screw him sir ” in kipling s the light that failed chapter xiii torpenhow urges dick to attend a party that night “we shall be half screwed before the morning ” is his dismal sales pitch to dick   in chapter vi of vanity fair thackeray reports on joe sedley s drunken avowal to wed becky sharp the next morning even if he had to “knock up the archbishop of canterbury at lambeth ” in order to have him in readiness to perform the ceremony in great expectations chapter vi we learn how “ mr whopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper ” and who could blame him   many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from the pure minded use of a word that suggests unmentionable parts of the human body it does not take a too wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a lewd nature who can for instance blame a youth with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing when he reads in pater s marius the epicurean chapter v a reference to apuleius the golden ass noting that “all through the book there is an unmistakably real feeling for asses ” in scott s the bride of lammermoor chapter vii one reads about a boy “cudgelling an ass ” and one goes back over the passage to reassure himself that it does not contain a typographical error for “cuddling ”   one may be indulged a giggle even though he is sure that isak dinesen did not intend an impropriety when she recorded in out of africa part v chapter   how “fathima s big white cock came strutting up before me ” and one is certain that kenneth rexroth in his american poetry in the twentieth century  herder and herder n y      did not intend to hint at closet biographical matter when in chapter i he wrote that “whitman s poems are full of men doing things together ” or later in the same chapter when he referred to “whitman s joyous workmen swinging their tools in the open air ” college freshman still read with flendish glee the first line in canto i of spenser s the faerie queene and never mind the title that tells how   a gentle knight was pricking on the plaine   in his poem mr nixon from hugh selwyn mauberley ezra pound s mr nixon advises kindly   don t kick against the pricks   although the identities of the latter are not divulged   one is entitled to speculate on what outrageous proposal the narrator had made in proust s remembrance of things past vol  —cities of the plain  translated by c k scott moncrieff—modern library n y      page    to cause the duchess to say “apart from your balls can t i be of any use to you ” there is a famous letter penned by rupert brooke to his friend edward marsh from somewhere near fiji  p     of a treasury of the world s great letters simon and schuster n y      in which he relates how he sends his native boy up a palm tree where he “cuts off a couple of vast nuts ” macho victim not disclosed in the first chapter of uncle tom s cabin miss stowe offers a dialogue between haley and mr shelby part of which goes “ well said haley after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season  what do you say ” in bleak house chapter xxiv dickens may cause some readers to blush when he wrote of mr george s blush that “he reddened a little through his brown ”   we must move ineluctably to a consideration of perfectly reputable words which having acquired sexual connotations cause adolescent—and often adult— hilarity even when read by a person of only mildly prurient mind in forster s a passage to india chapter xxxi a vivid picture is created by the sentence “tangles like this still interrupted their intercourse ” pages later chapter xxxvii it is acknowledged that “he too felt that this was their last free intercourse ” apparently from then on it was going to have to be cash or credit card only in the bride of lammermoor  chapter v we are informed that the heroine “placed certain restrictions on their intercourse ” a limitation that might have been more usefully set in that same author s rob roy chapter vii where we are told of the chance that the narrator and miss vernon might be “thrown into very close and frequent intercourse ”   a variation of this theme is found in robert browning s the flight of the duchess section v   —not he for in paris they told the elf our rough north land was the land of lays   even though it is generally acknowledged that paris is número uno in this area of human activity   more picturesque are the references to erections an arresting one occurs in a passage to india chapter xxi in which forster describes a small building as “a flimsy and frivolous erection ” while in the mayor of casterbridge chapter xvi the mayor himself “beheld the unattractive exterior of farfrae s erection ” a phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader   consider dickens sharp image in bleak house chapter liv when he describes how “sir leicester leans back in his chair and breathlessly ejaculates ” or in nicholas nickleby chapter xlvii where that admirable novelist graphically portrays how old arthur gride “again raised his hands again chuckled and again ejaculated ” and in his short tale lionizing edgar allan poe is quite candid in describing the reaction of one of his characters “ admirable he ejaculated thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre ”   alas for perfectly lovely words that acquire pejorative meanings over the years earlier in this century pansy became a derogatory epithet to describe an effete male thereby cheapening forever lines like shelley s noble image in adonais verse xxxiii   his head was bound with pansies over blown   not to mention poe s odd allusion in for annie   with rue and the beautiful puritan pansies   or more slap stickish e f benson s action picture in lucia in london chapter   “georgie stepped on a beautiful pansy ”   of more recent vintage is gay nobody used to snicker at chaucer s line no      in the prologe of the wyf of bathe in which that harried dame asks   why is my neghebores wif so gay   in his poem the menagerie one of william vaughan moody s characters advises   if nature made you so graceful don t get gay   while in othello ah the bard again in his dialogue with desdemona and emilia on the praise of women iago refers to the kind that   never lack d gold and yet went never gay   act ii scene i line   and what in the world is one to make of william butler yeats s startling revelation in his poem lapis lazuli from last poems that   they know that hamlet and lear are gay   indeed it is an amusing albeit utterly wasteful pastime to pursue the quest for red pants examples may good cess befall all such quixotically misguided readers one caveat never assume blithely that an odd word or suspicious phrase is as lubricious as it sounds in the bride of lammermoor chapter vi bucklaw vows “i will chop them off with my whinger ” and one feels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is but a whinyard which is merely a short sword “turning a corner of the mazza gallerie into a women s tennis store i was startled to see hordes of giggling high school girls ” from an article by dorothy gilliam in the washington post submitted by  light refractions      if you are a fan of old fashioned jazz—what is now known as “traditional” or “trad” jazz—you are familiar with one of the standard “jump tunes” of the genre—a tune most commonly called muskrat ramble even if you are not a fan you must have heard it as least a dozen times it is the one that goes “dah dah dah dah da dat dat dah da de da de da de dat dat dah  da de da de da de dat dat dah ”   that s it sure you ve heard it   i think i first bought a recording of muskrat ramble back in about      when i was in my early teens my memory is rickety but i am sure my first recording was labeled muskrat ramble and i think though i am less sure that it was played by the late “muggsy” spanier who was to my mind one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters later i got another recording of the same tune this one by i think mezz mezzrow the label said muskat ramble i thought that was surely the first time i had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all things a simple title on a simple    rpm record this remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors were called typographical errors not typos—at least by kids in junior high some time later i got still another version of muskrat ramble with still another version of the title this time it was muscat ramble that i thought was really absurd not only had they left out the “r” they d changed the “k” to “c” now it made no sense at all on the other hand i reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wasn t so outrageous i looked up muscat in my webster s and found that it is a variety of grape to name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous i was young and by today s standards at least pathetically innocent   during my time in senior high and after that in the army air force i had other things on my mind  there was a war on after all and i didn t give the muskrat muskat muscat ramble problem any thought   speaking of my time in the aaf which was utterly undistinguished i think i must make a confession now might be as good a time as any to reveal a theft i committed at an air force base near seymour indiana it was winter and bitterly cold the wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with what seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our bodies one day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero i took shelter in the service club there was the omnipresent phonograph or vic short for victrola and the stack of records next to it in those days people as a rule did not take much care of phonograph records usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks where they picked up dust scratched one another and traded static electricity i was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and i came across three bessie smiths i played all three and the few other g i s in the room which was quite large—big enough for a fair sized dance with a small orchestra—either paid no attention or asked me to put on something by glenn miller or jimmy or tommy dorsey instead among bessie s numbers were dying gambler s blues sing sing prison blues and one i had never heard called black mountain blues which has the imcomparable lines   home in black mountain a chile will smack yo face  home in black mountain a chile will smack yo face  babies cry for liquor an all the birds sing bass   and   goin back to black mountain me an my razor an my gun  goin back to black mountain me an my razor an my gun  goin cut him if he stan still goin shoot him if he run   i was and still am captivated by “babies cry for liquor an the birds sing bass ” and in the arrogance of my youth i was certain that nobody else on the airfield either knew or cared who bessie smith was nor would any other g i be enchanted by basso birds so i turned thief i can t remember how i did it but somehow i smuggled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough i kept them in good shape until my last    rpm turntable died   end of digression and back to muskrat kat cat muskrat ramble is credited to edward “kid” ory and ray gilbert “kid” ory played great jazz trombone the only thing i know about gilbert is that i find him listed as co author of muskrat ramble   about thirty years ago when i was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that i had no sherry on hand i went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that i thought might be exactly right for my sauce it wasn t bad the wine jogged my thoughts back to muscat ramble muscatel is made from muscat grapes is sometimes called muscat and being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many wines an old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthday—meaning twenty years of aa sobriety—a couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk tank the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle and napa valley smoke   i made up my mind that muscat ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune my reasoning is that it is not likely that “kid” ory or ray gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and it s even less likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling muskrats according to my encyclopedia look like giant rats are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds have partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming they do not appear to do much rambling muscat or muscatel on the other hand is found on skid rows all over the land a guy with a bottle shaped brown paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof and the odds are pretty good you would find it is a muscadoodle after the guy finishes his napa valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix now he is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his roadmapped eyes i suspect that that is precisely the song s origin   my theory is that the “r” got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat it is the same reason most of us i assume have heard “he s in the hospital with prostrate trouble ” prostrate is a more common word that prostate so prostrate is what we get the “r” fits in naturally i got a strange sort of corroboration from my good friend rosy mchargue who is now pushing eighty seven years and has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbands—benny goodman red nichols ted weems and a slew of others rosy too had seen the tune as muskrat muskat and muscat i asked him what he thought the original title was he had known “kid” ory well and he said “you know tom i m not exactly sure i once asked ory about it and he said it s m u s c a t muskrat so i think that s just the way everyone said muscat ”   there you are i find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually i picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water but i wouldn t call that rambling on the other hand a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat level—now that has a touch of poetry maybe not in the same class with “all the birds sing bass ” but poetry nevertheless   as a

  antipodean newsletter     leonard bloomfield having begun with a theory of meaning which emphasized the environment in which objects were present and named had to add the obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is not present i have lately been reading accounts of the exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of australia in the     s and i have become very aware of the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency of particular items in discourse in the desert the missing necessity is water as the explorer ernest giles put it the explorer s experience is a “baptism worse than that of fire—the baptism of no water ”   my impression was that in the journals of desert explorers the word water alone or in compounds and words relating to water were unusually frequent it is i suppose likely that people with little money must think of money more than the well off do and that the hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty on drink here was a chance to quantify such things i decided to make a count of words relating to water in reports of desert exploration   taking quite at random a single page page   in the journals of the gregory brothers recording an early       exploration of country east and north of perth i find the word water used fifteen times ten pages on  page    water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream twice well twice pool channel and the circumlocution “essential element ” two words dew and shower refer in the context to the presence of water the rest are in contexts indicating its absence   i tried another explorer ernest giles taking page    again i was reminded that giles is rather given to semi serious poetic diction at times and we find him referring to the presence of water in the finke river as “the stream purling over its stony floor” or quoting some bygone poet “brightly the brook through the green leaflets giddy with joyousness dances along ” perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration two hundred pages further on there is less exuberance in the circumlocution “that fluid so terribly scarce in the region ” and in three other references water is simply water giles is not always waxing poetic and may like other explorers be useful as a source for the history of australian and general english his use of the word tank to refer to a hollowed out reservoir  “gibson dug a small tank and the water soon cleared” antedates the oed for instance   since this linguistic statistical study of an obsession might well prove to be an important contribution to psycholinguistics i decided to make a larger sample of watery words choosing the straightforward journals of colonel peter egerton warburton who led an expedition across the western interior of australia in        in a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages         of the published journal there were twenty eight occurrences of the word water eight of them in compounds no page being without at least one example in addition there was a rich collection of words relating to water not necessarily indicating its presence “hoping to find a lake” is included though of course it doesn t indicate the presence of water even words which are usually of more general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like this gum trees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs of possible water apart from these words and lake words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool springs drainage hole clay hole flood channel water courses water hole rock hole drink drinkable running water stream and native well   the last two items merit comment stream is often said not to be used in australia except in metaphorical ways normally being replaced by creek warburton s use “sandbanks intercept the stream which finally splits into narow water courses and spreads itself over the plains and so it ends as a creek” suggests a somewhat more complex relation between the two words british born explorers did not set out to write australian english of course gregory uses stream in the way normal in england giles consistently refers to gens in the hills of central australia though glen is not current outside place names in contemporary australian english   the other name native well is as a later explorer david carnegie author of spinifex and sand points out a misnomer he believes native wells are essentially rock holes depressions in rock buried in fairly shallow sand which when hollowed out by the natives appear to be wells this sort of misnomer leads carnegie to suppose that “to the uninitiated no map is so misleading as that of west australia where lakes are salt bogs without surface water springs seldom run and native wells are merely tiny holes in the rock yielding from   to     gallons ”   carnegie also describes namma holes and soaks as sources of water soaks are shallow wells sunk near the base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir namma holes have been variously described to carnegie they are depressions on the surface of rocks often with a rounded bottom where stones are often found suggesting that the stones have something to do with the formation of the holes   some nostalgic early australians deplored the loss in our speech of english country words the glens and streams alive anyway in the journals of explorers coppices and brooks woods becks and rivulets perhaps these words did not really fit we might have done better with arabic speaking settlers wadi for instance would describe an inland creek rather well be that as it may a later australian visitor to english drizzle might feel nostalgic when thinking of the parched and thirsty but water

those who are not familiar with feminist writings may find it useful and interesting to consider a book recently published in britain that is typical of the harsher brand of such works the work in question offers nothing regarding language so its review here is ancillary to the main function of verbatim the feminist movement is very much alive in britain and the “greenham common women” are probably largely responsible for much of the national sentiment against the cruise missiles installed at an american base near that village in britain as elsewhere most books by feminist writers are reviewed by women usually feminists men are seldom assigned to review them possibly because the editor fears that they will be either ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised if not biased against them or because the editor is a woman because writing an unfavorable review of a bad feminist book would be tantamount to treachery such books are often unjustifiably praised as was the case with this work by rosalind miles which was well received on its publication in june   according to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book rosalind miles is head of the centre for women s studies at coventry polytechnic a lecturer broadcaster journalist and author of several other books including a “highly acclaimed” biography of ben jonson one might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship but the text does not bear out the promise   for the most part the book consists of a rewriting of history from the dawn of time with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes the “fact” that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization as the development of agriculture for instance often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men and the “fact” that women have long been subjected to domination by men miles suggests that such domination is a recent phenomenon—only a couple of thousand years old—for she points to the clear superiority of women in primitive religions and matriarchies right on through to the egyptian dynastic rulers at one point she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting in order to keep track of menstruation and probably by the same token astronomy she quotes  and presumably accepts another source which holds that “woman first awakened in humankind the capacity to recognize abstracts ” if you believe that balderdash you ll believe anything   in the good old days we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves recent speculation has it that they were not slaves but—what would one call them — ordinary laborers here comes miles authoritatively quoting diodorus the greek historian who recorded      bc that “innocent women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves whose forced labour built the pyramids    bound in fetters they work continually without being allowed any rest by night or day they have not a rag to cover their nakedness and neither the weakness of age nor women s infirmities are any plea to excuse them but they are driven by blows until they drop dead ” p   as the pyramids were already about      years old when diodorus wrote his world history one is given to wonder what his authority might have been for such a vivid description it is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery to promulgate it miles s book is riddled with many similar distortions convenient omissions and generalizations    women have always commanded over half the sum total of human intelligence and creativity from the poet sappho who in the sixth century bc was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively and explore the range of female experience to the chinese polymath pan chao ban zhao who flourished around ad     as historian poet astronomer mathematician and educationalist the range is startling in every field women too numerous to list were involved in developing knowledge and contributing to the welfare of their societies as they did so the roman fabiola established a hospital where she worked both as nurse and doctor becoming the first known woman surgeon before she died in ad     p   earlier on page    we learnt about agnodice “who lived to become the world s first known woman gynaecologist ” in the fourth century bc clearly this rosily checkered past was soon to be replaced chiefly it seems as judeo christian islamic confucian buddhist cultures flourished it was not too bad early on when according to miles the seven maccabean martyrs who “saved judaism” did so only at the instigation of their mother miles continues   in early christianity likewise women found not merely a role but an instrument of resistance to male domination in choosing to be a bride of christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male fry thousands of young women helped to build the church of god with their body blood and bones when frenzied fathers husbands or fiancés preferred to see them die by fire sword or the fangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout sic the duty and destiny of womanhood p   but the situation soon deteriorated   even st paul later the unregenerate prophet of female inferiority was forced to acknowledge the help he received from lydia the seller of purple dyes in philippi ibid   this rewriting of history is punctuated by an array of four letter invectives applied to males and by adjectives like brilliant unusual inspiring and so forth to women citing a judaic law book of the   th century which identified a woman for the days preceding during and following her period as niddah  impure miles has the lack of taste to write the following   as a final stroke in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held in store for the jews the niddah had to wear special clothing as a badge of her separate and despised status p   here and there in this morass of misunderstanding miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with the eminent anthropologist joseph campbell campbell known for his extensive analyses of the world s mythologies religions and cultures noted the marked bias against women emerging from judaic concepts later reinforced by christian and islamic doctrine most of the religions of the world connected woman with mother earth fertility and all the other progenetic and nurturing associations and this was borne out in the cultures of the people according to campbell the only godlike female figure in the bible is the virgin mary and she appears identified as virgin only in the gospel according to luke as luke was a greek campbell suggested that mary was a carryover from the paganism of the ancient greek pantheon although this might help explain the judeo christian muslim tendencies to subjugate women treating them essentially as chattel it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures notably that of japan it is not entirely clear whether campbell was commenting on hinduism buddhism etc as they once existed conceptually for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religous precepts   campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and that there was no real distinction between gods and goddesses who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful with all respect that seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex for this discussion though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities or divinity when we come to examine judaism and its congeners and progeny other debatable aspects are the questions of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of the theology or the ritual whether the scripture of any religion should be understood allegorically or literally and so forth if there is something wrong it behooves us to get at the roots of the problem not to flail about wildly for only after the source of a disease has been identified can one properly investigate its cure   “history according to rosalind miles” blasts away at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating them will effect a cure of the disease in this jeremiad males are viewed as the “enemy ” and are so characterized throughout the book which concludes with exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call to arms though not men s   laurence urdang  archaeology language   a verbatim book club selection   just when you thought it was safe to assume that we now know all we are ever likely to know about the past someone digs another hole and unearths literally or figuratively some ancient artifact one day it is a fragile scroll found in a cave near the dead sea that turns out to be pre biblical the next day it is an entire terracotta army of chinese soldiers the next it is a skull excavated from the olduvai gorge that compels anthropologists once again to revise their guesses about the earliest stages of homo sapiens sapiens vs hominids most of the relies from the past are gone forever destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers reduced to rubble by erosion by conquerors by prehistoric and modern urban developers by fire and flood and just by time many we may hope have not yet been found the interest in man s forebears did not become fashionable upon the publication a few years ago of roots on a far larger scale we have been trying to discover all we can about the origins not of men but of man strange to say however that interest does not seem to be more than a few hundred years old if the ancient greeks and romans the indians the chinese and other peoples were curious about their own prehistory i have not heard of it perhaps the fascination with man s past grew out of the obsession with ruins evinced by romanticism certainly modern archaeology seems to have followed close behind for the excavation of the supposed site of troy took place only about     years ago perhaps it is just as well for only by the means available to modern science are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts that we find and through radiocarbon dating determine their approximate age   archaeology is a popular pursuit and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums not so paleolinguistics or the reconstruction of ancient languages even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse classical latin and greek hebrew and a few other languages are better documented than others but for most all we have to go on are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptions there barely enough in many cases to allow us to identify the language let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning perhaps one day we shall find an etruscan library buried deep in the italian countryside but for the present we have to make do with what we have which is precious little about languages that had no writing system we know nothing at all but some very clever comparative linguists beginning in germany in the   th century theorized about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues in some instances ancient languages have been decoded some from multilingual inscriptions the work of jean francois champollion            in deciphering hieroglyphics from the rosetta stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we have today about their civilization which lasted for about      years another significant break through was that of michael ventris           who deciphered the linear b script found on crete and identified it as an early form of greek from the standpoint of language ventris s work was more important particularly because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of the early states of indo european languages   many years ago a linguistic scholar counted all of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence the total was approximately      but that is probably only a vague estimate he undoubtedly missed some some have sprung up since his time modern hebrew for instance and some have vanished the exact count is unimportant and at best spurious for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language then too one must examine the techniques used to group the many languages of the world   linguists examining classical greek latin german english slavic swedish norwegian danish dutch lithuanian iranian hindi and the other languages of india and europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words some like french spanish italian and portuguese had more in common with one another than they did with say german english swedish danish and dutch which in turn bore only a remote resemblance to russian and polish on the one hand and the two extant varieties of say gaelic on the other one rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes for after years of laboriously categorizing these languages the number of different main branches called families and subfamilies came to about ten ingeniously certain differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that  inexplicably took place in one language group but not in another although certain other languages were geographically nearby it was impossible to establish any resemblances between them hence basque for example is not classified as being in the same family with other european languages nor are hungarian and finnish both of which belong to their own group at the conclusion of this vast exercise done without the aid of computers there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken in earlier times from britain as far east as chinese turkestan and from india as far north as lappland charts showing the chief languages and their derivations can be found in many dictionaries—inside the front cover of the random house unabridged for example because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among languages it is best to avoid using an older chart for the same reason it would be wise not to stake too much on the accuracy of even a current chart   the languages discussed here are what are usually called the indo european family similar family trees could be drawn for the semitic languages sino tibetan japanese bantu malayo polynesian and so on each is a distinct phylum although there may be word borrowing among them lexicon is considered less important in the classification of languages than structure and grammar it is important too to note that writing systems are irrelevant for instance polish is written today using the roman alphabet but russian a related slavic language uses the cyrillic yiddish a germanic language is written in hebrew characters latin greek and sanskrit which resemble one another rather closely in some respects all use different alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages were written in cuneiform quite suitable for writing on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics  it would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard to organize languages they were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials but only rarely did they collaborate and with few exceptions their work was not correlated in a systematic way schliemann who discovered the site of troy used the evidence in homer s iliad to determine his digging site where any ruins had long since disappeared from view in many other places the ancient sites lay buried—and still do—beneath modern cities modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below today before a new building is erected in london an archaeological team examines the cleared site for its archaeological significance but there as everywhere else nothing can interfere with progress and regardless of the finds and their importance the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer notwithstanding even the brief glimpses afforded by such investigations can provide some insight into civilizations that existed hundreds or in some cases thousands of years earlier   based on the sparse evidence available linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested in other words based on what they knew about a group of languages which were documented they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from in most cases they dealt with words and functional elements creating what are called reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called variously proto latin proto greek proto germanic proto indo iranian and so forth the ultimate goal being to posit a single language called proto indo european that is not entirely true for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was literally a single language from which all indo european languages descended nonetheless it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of proto dialects which can be referred to as proto indo european  it seems only natural that once an original language or ursprache was posited the next step was to speculate on its source or urheimat that is what renfrew has tried to do essentially he proposes that the parent of all indo european languages was itself born in central anatolia whence it spread eastward westward and northward being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable modern manifestations which we categorize into germanic hellenic italic indo iranian anatolian armenian celtic tocharian albanian and baltoslavic   i have no quarrel with renfrew s theory—notwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of the black sea region and the volga steppes it is difficult for the nonspecialist reader like me to assess the validity of his arguments which are based on his contention that the language and its congeners were carried along by the spread of nomad pastoralism using the evidence available renfrew contends that the original indo european language closely related to hittite separated after      bc with the ie languages of western europe developing from western anatolia and those of iran india and pakistan from the eastern division the choice between the prevailing theory and renfrew s depends on whether one accepts a “wave” theory first promulgated more than a hundred years ago by johnanes schmidt a german linguist or one of indigenous development pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture from turkmenia or a late development of the indus civilization renfrew accepts the wave theory and in the last two thirds of archaeology language he sets forth his arguments in its favor unfortunately the presentation of his linguistic argument where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology where he is on more familiar territory is disorganized and repetitious it is difficult to place all the blame on renfrew for his editor should have noticed the lack of coherence the result is an argument that is persuasive but scarely convincing   nevertheless good books on archaeology assimilable by laymen are not easy to find and if the reader can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned about the precise birthplace of indo european archaelogy language provides an interesting march through the millennia of prehistory in seven league boots   laurence urdang  webster s electronic thesaurus  this software consists of two disks one labeled installation and program the other synonym linguibase and a manual the manual sets forth everything with clarity and the program is simple to install requiring only a few minutes only one thing made me a little suspicious when cranking up the system in the descriptive text that appears on the screen the word labeled is spelt “labelled”—decidedly un american however i went ahead and since i was typing the text you are reading returned to the beginning of the paragraph to see how some of these words would fare i looked up the word preceding and was after a brief moment asked to type in the word which i did the screen bloomed forth with the following   query preceding     adj being before especially in time or arrangement   there were also some other parts of speech one definition for the preposition and three for the verb  participial senses i called up the synonyms for the adj and the following appeared   synonyms   antecedent anterior foregoing former past precedent previous prior   the way the program works is this one uses the cursor to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are desired it is similar in principle to finding a synonym in a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms to find them i am not sure why but i expected the program to “network” in the same way however when i highlighted antecedent what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent missing and preceding had reappeared if all this is too complicated to follow let me summarize you look up word x and get synonyms a b c d e f and g you look up the synonyms for word a and you get synonyms x b c d e f and g even the definition provided for the sub listings is identical in wording to that of the word originally sought   this is very economical of space and involves a clever computer ploy but it does not provide a particularly useful synonym dictionary for as we all know synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative law of mathematics in language “things equal to the same thing are not necessarily equal to each other ” perhaps the proximity people thought that they had got round that little problem by giving the same definition for each of the items in the list but we know that only very rarely are two synonyms bi unique  which is another way of saying that if a b b does not necessarily always equal a an ineluctable fact of language   if a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary is likely to be of use then this

increased it also has a few neat features like suggesting a few alternatives if you happen to think that preceding is spelt “preceeding”  as many people do it has a useful “help” feature that can be called upon at any stage also if you enter jump you get the synonyms for that but if you enter jumped you get the same synonyms but inflected—including the variants leapt leaped for leap all in all for a relatively primitive system it is not too bad but you would have to be in love with your computer to use it in preference to a far more complete books of synonyms available especially the synonym finder rodale in the u s and canada longman elsewhere which offers more than         synonyms more than three times the number listed in any other synonym book   the blurb on this book disk package reads “supplies you with         true synonyms for        entries ” my guess is that such a quantity might be reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations in reality though there are probably far fewer actual words readers can judge for themselves the validity of this numerical legerdemain   laurence urdang  family words  in      american speech published “family words

informal references to family language some of which are documented by dickson in his bibliography   family words and expressions crop up everywhere some are quite unique and their reporters cannot imagine their origin others like penn station “what one family terms a child s misinterpretation of a famous line or phrase ” are clear the generic term comes from the lord s prayer—“and lead us not

of post civil war history tells me the following origin of shot as in shotglass absent from “gunning for the english language”   although we associate trench warfare with world war i trenches were characteristic also of the civil war a scaffold was built so that a rifleman— who fired a single shot muzzle loading shoulder weapon—could step up and shoot over the top of the trench the soldier in charge would command after each firing that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire   that war like others produced disgruntled veterans and those more adventurous or more restless after military service they moved westward to start a new life the population increased markedly with corresponding demands for goods and services among them the need for saloons most new saloons were small and the bars short accommodating with difficulty the many bunched up in ranks if you will calling for whiskey many of the thirsty crowd were veterans as were many of the bartenders thus “step down or back and give me a shot” was readily understood i ve not been able to corroborate this explanation but i ll never forget it       mr joseph hymes “do mistake—learn better”  xv   brought to mind the time a japanese acquaintance told me of a friend of hers who decided to tackle the original english version of three books she had enjoyed while in japan she boldly marched into a bookstore and asked the salesclerk for a copy each of hemingway s the sun come up again and throw away the gun and steinbeck s the angry grape is there a term for the errors that creep in while translating a passage back into the original tongue       mr davidson s observations on the scottishness of chambers   th century dictionary xv   bear out my own formed over sixteen years of using one an odd sidelight on this came a few days after reading the article definitions under pet end with “petting party  coll a gathering for the purpose of caressing as an organised sport origin unknown not from gaelic ” i think it hardly fanciful to discern a note of calvinist disapproval in this curt disclaimer       although i greatly enjoyed richard lederer s article i fear that one of his paragraphs is a load of brass monkey balls   the monkey on board ship was a lad employed to fetch supplies—powder and so forth—to the guns the word might also have been used for a receptacle near the guns where powder and balls were kept however this receptacle would have taken the form of a wooden box or something similar the idea of a metal stand carrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced as to be affected by the tiny differential expansion of brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a heavy sea   so what is the explanation of the phrase cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey well the obvious one i believe anybody who asks “why a brass monkey ” is probably not aware that brass monkeys were very common household ornaments in england in the   th and early   th centuries originally they were probably imported from india but were later mass produced in places such as birmingham to grace victorian and edwardian mantelshelves they can still be found today in so called “gift shops ” usually they come in sets of three one with its hands over its eyes one over its ears and one over its mouth they were said to represent “see no evil hear no evil speak no evil ” there were various whimsical variants       i am sure i am not the first to point out joseph hynes s “do mistake—learn better ” xv   mistakes in japanizing english words e g sei fu not “safe o ” nain not “nine o ” the possibilities for representing english with a language of only forty seven syllables are not that numerous and the rules are very consistent the main problems are representing consonant clusters and word final consonants these difficulties produce such monstrosities as sutoraike for english  strike —one syllable in english five in japanese   every japan veteran has his list of favorite mistakes mine are the ones that are possible but wrong english adding the japanese final vowels produces gone with the windo hypercorrection where japanese speakers learn that many final vowels do not exist in the american version of the tongue and so remove them sometimes incorrectly gives us the california cities of san francisk and sacrament this process resulted in the sign reading pizz and coffee   my absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes however does not come from the problem of sound japanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation or permission—in english “to make someone or to let someone do something ” one day during a university english class a very discomfited student after frantic and obtrusive dictionary work handed a colleague of mine a scrap of paper on it was written this sentence “please make me go to the bathroom ”      you could look it up  as everyone in the world must know by now william safire writes a column in the new york times magazine called “on language ” considering the circulation of the new york times on sundays his column is probably the most widely read commentary on contemporary english in the world that places more than one uncommon burden on a writer he must do his utmost to be accurate he must try to select subjects likely to be of interest to his readers and he must write well   those familiar with safire s editorial style reflected in his political columns on the editorial pages of the n y times may agree with me in the contention that when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off i cannot put my finger on why but “on language” always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute in part that is attributable to the designation of his correspondents who keep him informed on language that is not within earshot as the “lexicographic irregulars ” an amusing reference the first time or two it was used but now beginning to cloy more often than it might prove of interest to me personally safire deals with insiders language in washington where he is based or with trivialities uttered by some politico   as andrew norman wrote in a letter published in this book on page     “you flit freely back and forth between prescriptivism and descriptivism ” but are not many of us guilty of that we are descriptive of the usages we accept and prescriptive—perhaps proscriptive would be more descriptive—of those we do not like at least safire expresses an opinion whether the reader agrees with him is another matter as are the questions of his accuracy which arise fairly often and that of the suitability of his style which as far as i know has not been broached before it ill behooves me excoriated recently as enamored of the “cheap larf ” to criticize safire s arch puns which permeate—“enliven” is probably the word his editor would use—his articles but i find some kinds of humor unsuitable for reading however they might evoke a chuckle when uttered viva voce a handful of examples from the book at hand   therefore i stand uncorrected p   “get your hand off my knee ” that s a mnemonic pronounced knee monic  ize right title p  juggernaughty but nice title p   slanguist p  lex appeal title p  logue rolling title p   on logue vs log some people prefer their logues sawed off p  but the library of congress wants to be non u in its spelling of logue words ibid   writing containing such labored figures makes for hard reading i am interested in what safire has to say about language but find myself stymied i get the feeling that he has deliberately created a minefield of interruptions in thought through which i must pick my way to the end notwithstanding the valuable role he plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language and in informing them about myriad facets of the subject i find it hard slogging or as he would probably write “sloguing”   you could look it up is the umpteenth collection of safire s columns and like the previous collections contains a selection of letters from readers it is those that are so sorely missed in his column true there is an occasional mention in his column of a point raised by a correspondent and the letters section of the magazine prints a comment from time to time but an important feature of the books is their inclusion of far more writer reader interaction than one might suspect from reading the column alone for one thing the letter writers call attention to errors or misinterpretations and are largely critical safire cannot be accused of being copy proud except evidently of awful puns as in “ ms is deliberately msterious but at least it is not deliberately msleading ” and other mscegenations   there is no gainsaying that safire is one of the most influential writers on contemporary english and it is essential that his books be in the libraries of all who are interested in the subject regardless of their alignment with his opinions for one thing he documents many neologisms an activity that endears him to many working lexicographers from the sometimes cavalier manner in which he treats his subject one wonders if safire feels the burden of the responsibility he has toward his readers   the publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from which this review was prepared unfortunately there was no proof of an index but the publisher has assured me that there will be one in the published book a rather essential ingredient of a work with this title   laurence urdang  webster s new world guide to current american usage   here is a commonsense style book useful to those who have the education and common sense to be in doubt about questions of english usage it has some problems if you want to be sticky about things on p xv we read    einstein s special theory of relativity does not say that e mc² and in leap year mc³   indeed it does not but it does say e mc² the version with the capital m and c is essentially meaningless to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used in physics   while i acknowledge that it is not easy to know how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a usage book most reasonable writers have taken a stab at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely place to look then have provided a detailed index not bernice randall true one can find different from etc in an entry so headed but for absolute constructions one is referred to an entry called “covered with onions relish and ketchup i ate a hotdog at the ball park ” if the user wants to find out about misplaced adjectives and adverbs reference is made to the entry “electric shaver for women with delicate floral design on the handle ” a search for only would be futile   perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need some lightening up but i am hard put to agree that they are quite as frivolous and light headed as this book would have us believe fun is fun but those who might rely on such a book are quite serious about the information they are seeking and it is unfair to play fast and loose with their sincerity a sense of humor about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it but security is the one characteristic often lacking among those who would use current american usage   there is no doubt that randall enjoys her work but of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms and of what use are the interminable examples for instance of the misuse of like for as which draw out the entry to three pages more than four pages are devoted to clichés under the guise of “lo and behold it s man s best friend ” which being an exclamation really ought to end in an exclamation point the article on british american english “there s no home like eaton place ” is a good one but at six pages its utility is questionable in the matter of pronunciations of breng names it is an old fashioned fantasy of americans that brits go round saying pom frit for pontefract most brits that i have heard give the name a spelling pronunciation these days and so with many of the old shibboleths of what relevance to usage notwithstanding the fact that the topic is interesting is an entry on eponyms “john bull and john hancock are not just any johns ” that is not strictly speaking a subject pertinent to the title of the book   all of which is to say that the book is an interesting work on the language and contains accurate though longwinded information about what it covers “interesting and useful facts about american english ” its only real faults are its title which belies the content the cutesy headings and the lack of a truly detailed index self indexing does not provide coverage of sufficient detail as a reference work on usage it is far from complete the simon and schuster publicity department could have used an entry on foreword forward spelt “foreward” in the release accompanying the review copy   a longish section “some troublesome idiomatic prepositions ” and a “glossary of grammatical and linguistic terms used in this book ” followed by a list of “references ” sources associated with specific entries round out the work   laurence urdang  language notes from abroad    “once more unto the breach for the warriors of   académie française in their uphill battle to preserve the purity of their native tongue examples of franglais which they find particularly monstrous are i hear to be condemned to a newly created “musée des horreurs ” the first is “sponsor sponsoriser sponsorisation

earlier books especially our marvelous native tongue the life and times of the english language one might say that subtitling the present book “a book of lost metaphors” is an example of a loose canon sic — unless metaphor is taken in its broadest sense—but one is unlikely to find red herrings here the etymologies of a few hundred words and phrases are given many not readily findable in standard works of reference the rationale behind referring to them as “lost” arises from the author s observation of an unfortunate state of affairs because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity with the basic structural elements of our culture—greek and roman mythology the bible literature and ordinary historical fact—people today are unable to discern the origins of terms like aphrodisiac achilles sic heel or tendon meet one s waterloo sow dragon s teeth and hand writing on the wall to name a few there are many of course but unaccountably they are not the focus of this book   claiborne investigates and reports on expressions like sow one s wild oats about which he tells us little or nothing the modern latinate designation avena fatua came too many centuries after the original expression to have any relevance to it so why bring up the information that fatua is latin for foolish it was also latin for wild which might be more to the point in any event it is hard to discern from the arch style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting just what is the origin of sow one s wild oats in many entries claiborne labors the obvious offering little or nothing we do not already know could easily imagine or for which the author offers no explanation among examples of the first are spit and polish on the spot on the square stick one s neck out etc examples of the last include spill the beans square the circle stalemate etc between these is an occasional flash of useful wisdom much of it pretty well covered by other books of this type which seem to be proliferating   what is missing for example at square the circle is the information that because the area of a circle is mathematically calculated using pi which is irrational there is no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a given circle but that does not mean that such a square cannot exist as for stalemate which is related to checkmate would it not have been important to indicate that the mate part has nothing to do with english having been borrowed from checkmate which is a loanword from persian and has nothing to do with check either   often an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology and merely explains the meaning does any reader need an entry like this one   straddle when you straddle a horse you ve got one leg on either side of the animal when a politican straddles an issue he s in much the same position   some speculative suggestions as the derivation or reinforcement from seidlitz powders for take a powder are sheer nonsense not all entries contain misleading dull or incorrect information but those that do not are marked by a lack of originality   laurence urdang  word maps   dialect geography a branch of dialectology describes certain features of the dialects of a language and their distribution the field is about     years old most prominent among its earliest practitioners in england was joseph wright who prepared the six volume english dialect dictionary which was published between      and      the best known contemporary british specialist is harold orton in america work proceeded space during the     s largely under the direction of raven mcdavid hans kurath and later harold allen more recently lee pedersen and others have investigated american english dialects between      and      fieldworkers based at the university of leeds conducted the survey of english dialects which studied     localities in england which as everyone ought to know does not include wales or scotland the present book is extracted from the two major works that resulted from the survey the linguistic atlas of england      and a word geography of england      both under the direction of harold orton aided by sanderson and widdowson in the latter effort   people generally seem to find dialect study interesting one letter writer to the times    june reported   our close neighbour in bere regis who was born in the village and who speaks with a delicious dorset burr always uses “i” instead of “me ”  “well it makes company for i and company for she ” another of his happy expressions is inner wards meaning since as in “i chucked him out the door and he s not been back innerwards ”   another reported same date   let s get it right the bristol for “me” is not “i ” but “oi ” when i was teaching there the explanation invariably given by boys brought to me for scrapping in the playground was “ee it oi so oi it ee ”   the     maps selected for representation from the survey yield information on several hundred words some of which are clear variants others quite different lexical entities for instance map    shows the areas marked off by boundary lines where the variants chimley chimbley chimmock chimdey chimbey and chimney occur map    shows the distribution of child  most of southern england and of bairn north of a slightly wavy line between boston on the wash to the east and lancaster on the west coast   the authors have provided a brief introduction which is easy to follow a list of suggested readings and the names and addresses of the several institutions and societies in britain where readers may indulge a more intensive interest in dialect study the maps are clear each occupying a full page and the word information is well set forth on them where necessary brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any information that might seem to be out of the ordinary i have only one nit to pick with the authors in their description of isoglosses they write   these are drawn to run midway between localities which were shown by the survey of english dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of the map   although it is true that isoglosses in effect set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites either where speakers employ both usages or where speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity hence the term isogloss from iso same gloss  word to describe the line on a map where the terms are of equal distribution isoglosses are to dialect maps what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps what isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans etc the authors are not alone in getting this wrong it is incorrect in some dictionaries   in those countries where dialect study is undertaken dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals news services radio and television the establishment of “prestige” dialects and through the media their promulgation and the huge population shifts that have taken place particularly in the u s since wwii such shifts have been somewhat slower in england but seem now to be speeding up there are many other lesser factors at work but taken together all tend toward standardization especially as the older speakers die off in some respects it may not be long before certain aspects of dialect geography will be largely historical the importance of dialect is emphasized regularly in the press where we read about people being killed as in parts of india because they use the wrong shibboleths   this book is a good introduction to the subject in england those familiar with dialectology in america and those interested in the study in england or indeed generally would be well advised to add word maps to their libraries   laurence urdang  american literary almanac   this is an interesting useful reference book containing information about the better known writers of america it is divided into eighteen chapters varying in length each dealing with a different aspect of the authors and their works among them   writers related to writers schooldays which colleges and universities spawned which writers american literary pseudonyms american literary title sources literary cons hoaxes frauds and plagiarism in american literature the profession of authorship  authors publishers editors agents thrown to the wolves reviews and reviewers   these are supplemented by an extensive bibliography and a detailed index   as can be seen from the chapter headings some of the material is trivial but nonetheless interesting for that it is not at once apparent why the book is styled an “almanac ” but that is unimportant there is no other book i know of that contains as much diverse information about american writers as this one its readability and organization make it suitable for browsing—even for reading straight through—so in that respect at least it does not resemble books in the “oxford companion” series it contains many photographs of writers some quite early these enliven the appearance of the book but accomplish little else unless one is interested in what samuel clemens looked like at the age of    as a printer s devil or in the appearance of hart crane standing in the middle of a railroad track in cleveland in   it is difficult to make any sensible connection between the lives of authors and their creations a handful might have led colorful existences some are objects of interest because they died early committed suicide were related to other famous people and so forth but such information seldom reveals as much about their output as do the creations themselves and in certain cases one is probably better off not knowing quite so much   this book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as an adjunct to most libraries public and private large and small general and specialized   laurence urdang “faculty protest against apartheid at

  dear friend of animals  i hope you’ll use the enclosed name labels and colorful pet stickers designed especially for friends of animals  your name and the name of the humane society of the united states hsus are very important to the well being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives  i wish i could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earth’s animals dogs cats farm animals and wildlife the sad truth is animal cruelty abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community  every day of the year the humane society of the united states receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties such as the horrors of the leghold trap the use of dog and cat fur needless or repetitive experiments on animals and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats  still others are less obvious but just as horrible dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk fed” veal for the gourmet and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen and almost           companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout america  what is even more shocking is that more than    million animals die these cruel painful deaths each year needless deaths that could have been stopped  and with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on i’m sure you can understand why the work of the humane society of the united states is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people like you to help us bring an end to animal suffering abuse and neglect  since      our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties  we also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty  our primary goal though has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering abuse and exploitation  but while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources  it’s a difficult problem because we have to fight the well financed and powerful agri business and research industries but we do our best to protect the animals  right now the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty  and that’s where you can help you can be a lifesaving “friend” to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of the hsus and asking them to become vigilant in safe guarding the lives of all animals  today we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption i hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home it’s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal too  i also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax deductible donation today your gift of at least   or    or even    will help the hsus save millions of animals  i know you care deeply for the well being of all animals please help us carry this message to others so that animal cruelty and abuse can be eliminated

  a brief history  prehistoric man in asia minor now modern turkey or greece  could look out across the aegean toward the horizon and see the faint  silhouette of land their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that  were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands  marking the start of the long legacy of mediterranean seafaring  around      b c the phoenicians set out from what is now  iran to explore their surroundings they eventually reached the  islands and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part  of the aegean sea an important early material obsidian was  discovered on the island of milos obsidian is a hard vitreous  volcanic rock which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and  stabbing the high quality of the seam on milos ensured that the area  remained popular with early travelers  the basic elements of life in the aegean began to come  together as early as      b c and were already in place by the late  bronze age c      b c the major changes were not to daily tasks  and routines but to the political power base which changed regularly  and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages  cycladic culture  at around      b c a sophisticated culture evolved in the  cyclades islands the distinctive sculpted marble figures of the era  are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs you will find  original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the  cyclades although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on  paros the people farmed and fished on the dawning of the bronze age  in      b c they began to work with metals the cycladic culture was  influenced by societies in the east importing the pottery wheel from  mesopotamia they also continued to trade in obsidian and the local  marble  the minoans and the myceneans  farther south in crete the minoan culture developed after       b c into the most significant of its age spreading its influence  throughout the region by trade and diplomacy santorini thira the  next major island north was heavily influenced by crete and the  settlements of thira and akrotiri thrived at this time the magnificent  frescoes and mosaics found at akrotiri are in athens at present but  the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the  sophistication of the culture here  around      b c a massive volcanic eruption at santorini  destroyed not only akrotiri — under feet of ash and pumice — but the  whole minoan civilization massive tidal waves swept over crete and  other parts of the mediterranean smashing buildings and drowning many  thousands of people  in the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval the aegean  islands next came under the influence of the mycenaeans at around  b c who had a base in the peloponnese region of the greek mainland  the mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer not to  trade their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by  homer in his epic poems the odyssey and the iliad  the rise of athens  the dorians who came overland from northern europe  conquered the mycenaeans they were a barbaric race and their custody  of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word  was forgotten and art disappeared they held sway over islands off the  northern greek coast but the phoenicians kept control of the main sea  routes south of the area trade continued as usual at the same time  city states began to grow in influence on the southern greek mainland  athens became the most powerful heralding the start of the classical  greek period however greece was not yet a country each city state  was self governing and autonomous  the new culture spread throughout the mediterranean helped  by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements  such as carthage a greek city on the african coast of the  mediterranean culture and the arts flourished once again athletic  prowess was admired and the olympic games were constituted in     b c  to promote friendly competition homer wrote his epic works on chios  and lyrical poetry was much admired particularly the work of the poets  archilochos on paros and sappho on lesvos  the preeminent islands of this era were delos a sacred  island and center of religion ruled by athens samos ruled by the  tyrant polycrates and naxos whose ruler lygdamis undertook some major  building projects archaeology shows that during this time societies  lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement  inland  the persian wars  as athens rose in influence and power in the west it was  matched in the east by the rise of the persian empire from a power  base in anatolia the persians overran the eastern aegean islands and  set their sights on the cyclades in     b c they captured sacred  delos and razed the settlements on naxos the island communities were  undecided about which side to back for a time paros and andros  contributed to the persian armory while others supported athens the  two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of marathon and  salamis in     b c the persians were defeated and athens duly  punished the islands that had turned against it  following its victory athens introduced the concept of a  mutual protection alliance a kind of nato of the ancient world  several islands and greek city states agreed to work together and  created a treasury to fund their plans which was held on the island of  delos the alliance became known as the delian league although there  were minor internal wrangles the league controlled the aegean and the  greater athenian empire for most of the fifth century b c later in      b c the treasury was transferred to athens and its deposits were  used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and  temples of the classical age  in     b c athens began a war with its neighbor and  league member sparta although the islands saw little action as the  war went on they could see that athens was slowly losing its power  before the end of the war in     b c many islands had already  transferred their allegiance to the victors who were led by philip ii  of macedon he was followed in     b c by his son alexander the great  one of the most remarkable leaders in history his rise to power  ushered in the hellenistic period  hellenistic and roman periods  when alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east  as india the aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes  delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire following  alexander’s death his lands were divided among his generals much of  the aegean came under the rule of the ptolemies along with egypt  cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan  although in    b c mithradates made a swift and  successful raid from the east across asia minor and the aegean islands  the next major power change brought influence from the west the greek  hellenistic empire was gradually and peacefully absorbed into the  roman empire  the byzantine empire and the coming of christianity  the romans ruled a pagan empire but the aegean had an  important influence on the early development of christianity in a d       st john arrived on patmos a small rocky island in the dodecanese  as a political prisoner it was here that he wrote what was to become  the final book of the new testament the book of revelation it wasn’t  until a d     however when the newly converted emperor constantine  made byzantium renamed constantinople capital of his eastern empire  that christianity was assured of its dominant role in future greek  life  the byzantine empire had powerful and well fortified  cities but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by  waves of invaders in an attempt to counter a threat from the saracen  muslims a new potent religious force from the east the byzantine army  forcefully enlisted the men of the islands disease took a further  toll by the time of the crusades many of the aegean islands had been  practically depopulated  as the byzantine empire weakened at the end of the first  millennium crusader forces were sent from western europe to counter  the muslim forces and retake jerusalem for the christian faith  unfortunately their zeal was not matched by their discrimination the  crusaders swept through the l and of byzantium slaughtering christians  as well as muslims civilians as well as soldiers constantinople was  taken by crusader forces in      and they stripped the city of manyof  its finest treasures — which now grace the public buildings of  venice — although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was  transferred to the monastery at patmos before the city fell  while byzantine land was being divided there was no one in  control of the seas so pirates raided towns on many of the islands to  counter this the populations moved from their homes on the coast and  built settlements inland out of sight of the raiding parties this  created a pattern seen today throughout the aegean of a small port  skala which serves an inland settlement or chora making it easier to  protect the island from attack  the minor aegean islands were taken by various powerful  european noblemen many of whom were genoese or venetian such as marco  sanudo on naxos the noblemen had free rein to create their own  fiefdoms the venetians fortified their main towns — naxos town and  antiparos town are wonderful examples of this — creating labyrinths of  narrow alleys and cul de sacs that were designed to confuse and to  demoralize invaders the genoese took control of the eastern aegean  islands which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and  trade  after a final bloody defeat by the muslims in  christian forces were forced from the holy land the knights of st  john a holy military force made their way to rhodes and kos in the  dodecanese they began the process of building their strong citadels  and reinforcing the christian faith on the islands however they had  not seen the last of their muslim foe a force was gaining strength in  the east to threaten their new bases  the coming of the ottoman turks  the ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east  taking land in what is now turkey by the end of the   th century they  began their first raids on the aegean islands in      they took  constantinople and immediately made it their capital renaming it  istanbul  they then set their sights on the islands of the knights of  st john and after an unsuccessful siege in      they finally ejected  the knights from the dodecanese in      in      they wrested chios  from the genoese bolstering their hold on the eastern aegean islands  but the cyclades remained in venetian hands for another generation or  more — tinos was the last to fall in      the ottomans brought new  influences to the islands that they controlled forming a large empire  that stretched around the eastern mediterranean  toward greek independence  however a movement was growing on the greek peninsula  against ottoman rule and for an independent greek state in  russia came to aid the greeks defined by their orthodox religion  rather than by historical geographical boundaries declaring war on  the ottoman empire and occupying several aegean islands until  graffiti written by russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of  antiparos  although this attempt was unsuccessful the campaign for a  greek state continued into the   th century and began to grow in  strength the aegean islands played their part lesvos chios and  samos lay in the important shipping lanes and patriots began  disrupting ottoman cargo traffic in return the turks violently put  down every insurrection including the massacre on chios when  people were slaughtered  the ottoman empire was weakening however and in      the  peoples of the greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time  the cyclades and the sporades island chains were also included in this  new state a new sense of identity enveloped greek peoples throughout  the aegean thus commencing a movement to expand greece and unify the  disparate orthodox populations  the twentieth century  a series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the    th century began to sound a death knell for the ottoman empire the  turks lost a short war with italy and were forced to relinquish the  dodecanese islands to the italians greece took this opportunity to  absorb the islands of the northern and eastern aegean and to add  macedonia to its mainland territories  following this debacle the ottomans then allied themselves  to germany in the world war i losing more territory with the defeat of  the germans in that war greece was handed a strip of land along the  western coast of asia minor which for over       years had had a  substantial greek population greece moved in to administer the land  but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part  of greater greece  in      turkey broke away from the tired ottoman rulers  and kemal ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support he  promised a modern state for his people but as the situation became  volatile civil strife broke out in turkish cities and those  considered greek were victims of threats and violence many had to  leave their birthplaces fleeing to lesvos chios and samos the  greek ruled islands just offshore thousands of people arrived with  little more than the clothes they wore putting great strain on the  resources of the islands finally greece was ousted from its new  territory in asia minor which became part of the new turkish  state  greece attempted to stay out of world war ii but mussolini  saw greece as an ideal addition to his italian empire his forces made  a series of attacks from their bases in the dodecanese islands  including sinking a greek naval vessel in the harbor of tinos town but  they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population  against them later the germans came in force and occupied many of the  islands  after the war in      the dodecanese islands finally  became part of the greek nation but the country was politically  fragmented with arguments between monarchists and republicans right  and left and tension escalated into civil war the struggle bypassed  most of the islands although there was fierce fighting on samos even  after the fighting stopped more than a decade later the country was  not stable  at the same time the massive growth in air and road  transport saw shipping decline in importance the aegean islands which  for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes became  the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of  several islands came close to collapse  in      the military took the reins of power in athens  and until      the “colonels” held sway with a repressive and brutal  regime many greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty  and terror and many made new homes in the united states and australia  the expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism and greece  along with the aegean islands became exciting destinations for northern  europeans escaping their damp cool summers  in      greece joined the european common market now the  european union since this time membership has been of great monetary  benefit to the country the eu has given large subsidies to develop  greece’s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient  monuments  airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands  and road systems have been expanded and im proved private investment  has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible  politically the     s have been relatively quite times for  the islands although the divorce of greek prime minister andreas  papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused  consternation within conservative greek society  as the balkans flared to war once again greek nationalism  has stirred and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the  land of macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers whether  this will ever happen remains to be seen but perhaps the aid offered  by greece to turkey after     ’s devastating earthquake is a sign that  the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to  diminish 
  a brief history  jerusalem’s recorded history begins with its mention in  egyptian court records       years ago but there had been human  settlements here for centuries probably millennia before that at the  beginning of the second millennium b c jerusalem was a canaanite  mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route far less important than  biblical cities such as hazor megiddo beth shean and shechem the  earliest name associated with the city ur usalim perhaps meant “city  of shalim” or “founded by shalim ” scholars speculate that shalim  might have been an ancient semitic deity of peace for the name  resembles the modern hebrew and arabic words for “peace” shalom and  salaam respectively if true this is an ironic name for a city that  would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places  on the face of the earth  biblical jerusalem  in the bible genesis      –   records that abraham visited  the city of “salem” in approximately      b c and was blessed by the  city’s ruler melchzedik who offered him bread and wine the city is  not mentioned again in the bible until the time of the great poet  warrior king david who captured the city from the jebusites in about       b c the bible describes how david’s soldiers conquered jerusalem  by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the  city by surprise warren’s shaft part of a canaanite water system  discovered by   th century archaeologists and open to visitors might  be the very tunnel infiltrated by david’s army  perhaps because jerusalem was in neutral territory not  allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of israel david made it the  capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented  artisans dedicated priests magical poets and musicians and the most  formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city he  also brought the ark of the covenant the portable tabernacle  containing the tablets of the law received on mount sinai to the  spring of gihon just outside the walls of jerusalem there the ark  rested until it was placed in the temple built in approximately  b c on mt moriah the high point at the northern end of the city  the temple today known as the “first” temple was completed  by david’s son and successor king solomon according to biblical  tradition although david bought the land for the temple and carefully  assembled its building materials he was deemed unworthy of  constructing the temple because he was a man of war with blood on his  hands at the temple’s dedication solomon addressed his god “ the  heavens even the heaven of the heavens cannot contain thee how much  less this house that i have built ”  the site of the temple eventually became identified as mt  moriah on which it stood where abraham was called to sacrifice his  son isaac along with this splendid house of worship solomon built a  royal palace mansions for his wives temples for the foreign gods  worshipped by the princesses he had married and towers for the defense  of the capital under the wise reign of solomon the city flourished as  the capital of an empire that stretched from damascus to the red sea  and controlled the trade routes from egypt to phoenicia the temple and  royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from africa and with  cedar from lebanon the beauties and glories of jerusalem under solomon  have captivated readers of the bible for almost       years but with  his death the empire collapsed and the israelite kingdom was divided  into two separate impoverished often warring nations israel with  its capital at shechem in the north ruled by a series of northern  dynasties and the smaller kingdom of judah with its capital at  jerusalem from which the davidic dynasty continued to rule the bible  tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms  aroused the fury of the great prophets  in     b c the assyrian armies of sennacherib destroyed  israel and moved southward to besiege jerusalem thanks to king  hezekiah’s hidden water tunnel the city narrowly escaped destruction  the end of david’s dynasty came in     b c when nebuchadnezzar king  of babylon invaded judah to lay siege to jerusalem when it fell the  temple and all the buildings were burned the people of the  once glorious city were forced into an exile known as “the babylonian  captivity ”  in time the kingdom of babylon was overthrown and the  israelites were permitted to return to jerusalem in     b c the city  was now under the more tolerant rule of the persians but rebuilding  was slow work the second temple was finished in     b c but much of  the city still lay in ruins  jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the greeks in      b c under alexander the great and subsequently to his  hellenistic successors as well as the egyptian ptolomeys and the syrian  seleucids when seleucid rulers outlawed judaism jews led by judah  maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in     b c and against  all odds restored the primacy of jewish religious life in jerusalem  the macabbees cleansed the temple of hellenistic idols and the blood of  pagan sacrifices the eight day celebration of hanukkah feast of  dedication commemorates their victory the hasmonean dynasty  descendants of the maccabee family ruled an independent jewish  commonwealth that stretched from the negev to the galilee jerusalem  grew surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside  the jaffa gate the hasmoneans ruled until pompey’s roman legions  arrived in    b c  roman jerusalem  after the initial years of roman administration and  political infighting rome installed herod scion of a family from  idumea a jewish kingdom in the desert as king of judea he reigned  from    to   b c during which time he fortified the hasmonean wall  and rebuilt the defense towers beside jaffa gate the foundation of  which still stand several palaces were built and a water system  installed herod also completely rebuilt the temple making it one of  the most important religious centers in the roman empire the courtyard  around the temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of  pilgrims and the temple mount was shored up by retaining walls made  with great stone blocks one of these walls the western wall is today  a major reminder of jerusalem’s greatness under herod a massive  fortress was built overlooking the temple mount which herod named  “antonia” in honor of his roman friend and benefactor mark antony  for all his accomplishments herod was nevertheless hated  by his subjects he taxed he tortured and he ordered the massacre of  male jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded messiah  when jesus was born in about   b c joseph and mary escaped herod’s  paranoia by fleeing into egypt with the new born infant they returned  to live in the galilee village of nazareth making pilgrimages to  jerusalem  according to biblical accounts jesus spent his life  ministering in the galilee valley in about a d    he and his  followers went for passover to jerusalem which was in unrest at this  time dissatisfied with roman domination jesus’s entry into the temple  caused a commotion after the passover dinner he was arrested by the  temple priests who were under direct roman rule jesus was put on  trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion a roman form of execution  for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals  in a province rife with rebellion and retaliation the execution in  jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the galilee did not by  itself have an immediate effect on history  after jesus’s crucifixion harsh roman rule continued until  a d    when the jews rebelled for four years jewish zealots fought  against the might of rome at the end the roman general titus laid  siege to jerusalem in a d    finally attacking its starved and  weakened defenders those who didn’t escape were executed or sold into  slavery the holy city and the temple were destroyed the last of the  zealots held out for another three years at masada see page    half  a million civilians died in the galilee and judea as a result of this  first revolt against rome a number unequaled in ancient warfare  christian and islamic jerusalem  for    years jerusalem lay in ruins until the roman  emperor hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a roman town dedicated to  jupiter in outrage the jews began a second revolt against rome led  by simon bar kochba the ruins of jerusalem were briefly liberated  but in the end jewish resistance to rome was defeated with great loss  of life the planned new roman city aelia capitolina was built over  the ruins of herodian jerusalem and jews were barred from residing  there for all time jerusalem’s physical existence as a spiritual city  seemed finished but its spiritual power for jews and for the  struggling new christian religion remained for the next two centuries  aelia capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history  but the roman empire became christian in the fourth  century and jerusalem became a center of religion once again queen  helena a devout christian and the mother of emperor constantine the  great made a pilgrimage to the holy land in     to identify the sites  associated with jesus’s life she found that the city’s most beautiful  roman temple dedicated to the goddess aphrodite stood on the site of  the crucifixion the temple was demolished and a vast classical style  church was built around golgotha the hill where jesus’s crucifixion  was believed to have taken place throughout jerusalem other spots  important to jesus’s life were commemorated with religious structures  pilgrims came from all over the roman and later byzantine empire  during the following centuries but the prosperity they brought lasted  only until     when persian armies overtook judea and reduced  jerusalem to rubble again in     jerusalem was recaptured by the  byzantines  still reeling from the effects of the persian devastation  jerusalem was conquered in     by the forces of islam the temple mount  was identified in islamic tradition as “the farthest spot” in arabic  el aksa the site to which the prophet muhammad was transported in one  night from mecca on a winged horse as described in the   th chapter of  the koran from here the prophet ascended to the heavens and was  permitted to glimpse paradise the rock on the temple mount from which  he ascended at or close to the site of the ruined temple was  commemorated by the construction of the dome of the rock in     the  dome of the rock remains jerusalem’s most striking monument it is  counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created by about  the el aksa mosque third holiest place of prayer in islam after mecca  and medina had been built on the southern side of the temple mount  jerusalem continued under islamic rule for the next four and a half  centuries in      under their leaders godfrey de bouillon and  tancred the crusaders captured the holy city for christendom by  slaughtering both muslims and jews  crusaders mamelukes and turks  the crusaders established a feudal christian state with  godfrey at its head they built many impressive churches during the  term of the first latin kingdom of jerusalem but in      they were  driven out by muslim forces under the great warrior saladin during the  sixth crusade     –      the holy roman emperor frederick ii managed  to secure jerusalem for the christians by negotiation  the christians however could not hold the city after  they lost jerusalem a mongol invasion swept through and in      the  mameluke dynasty of egypt took control ruling jerusalem for the next      years the city struggled to rebuild from crusader wars and  invasions much of the best islamic architecture in the city was  constructed in the mameluke era but the past thousand years had taken  their toll jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had  enjoyed in earlier times  in the early   th century the ottoman turkish empire was  advancing through the middle east jerusalem fell to the ottomans in       remaining under their control for     years suleiman the  magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this  day fountains inns religious schools and barracks were constructed  but when suleiman died his empire including jerusalem began a long  period of decline the holy city remained a backwater until the   th  century when renewed interest among christian pilgrims made it the  destination of thousands of travelers each year    th century aspirations  at the same time many jews sought religious freedom and  fulfillment by moving to palestine as the holy land was traditionally  called and especially to jerusalem in the     s theodor herzl      –     worked to organize a movement zionism to create a jewish  state chaim weizmann     –     a scientist born in russia but later  a british subject did much to put herzl’s hopes into practice  weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the british  government that led to the balfour declaration of      supporting the  idea of a jewish “national home” in palestine that also respected the  rights of existing non jewish people already living there the problem  was that british strategists who were fighting the ottoman turks in       had secretly promised the lands to their world war i arab  allies  in      the league of nations granted the british a mandate  to administer palestine jerusalem flourished during the early years of  the mandate modern neighborhoods hospitals schools and the hebrew  university were built in west jerusalem the new jewish enclave but  arab opposition to new jewish immigration and construction in palestine  led to increasing strife by      jerusalem was an armed camp in  the united nations voted for the partition of palestine into two  states one jewish and one arab with jerusalem as an international  city that belonged to neither but lacking the means to enforce its  decision the united nations was powerless to halt the fighting that  erupted as the british withdrew their troops in  modern israel  the state of israel was declared during this difficult  time in response member states of the arab league sent troops to help  the palestinian arabs west jerusalem separated from the rest of the  new jewish nation held out under siege for several months until  israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the  coastal areas jews were evacuated from the old city’s jewish quarter  and thousands of arab families fled their homes in west jerusalem as a  result of armistice agreements in      jerusalem was divided west  jerusalem was to be under israeli control and east jerusalem  including the old city with its jewish muslim christian and  armenian quarters came under jordanian authority free access to holy  sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice  agreements however with the city partitioned by fortifications and  barbed wire no israeli or jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the  western wall or other jewish sites in east jerusalem  for the next    years jerusalem was two cities political  and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of  terrorism or sniping until the six day war in june      within three  days the city was completely in israeli hands and in two weeks it was  physically and administratively reunited jerusalem’s mayor teddy  kollek spent the next    years orchestrating a vast program of  development adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting  neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the  concerns of jerusalem’s many communities  today as always jerusalem is a city of controversies  religious jews in conflict with secular jews palestinians calling for  independence many residents protesting a wave of high rise development  that many claim will turn the holy city into a holy megalopolis but  the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily  special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present day  jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world’s attention into the new  millennium 
  a brief history  early habitation  the inhabited history of the las vegas valley stretches to         b c when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake  during this period the indigenous people lived in caves hunting the  mammals that gathered at the shoreline the landscape of the valley  changed dramatically over the next     centuries the glaciers feeding  the lake melted away and the lake evaporated fossils tell an obscure  story of man’s slow and sporadic development  around      b c native archaic indians began to develop a  lasting hunting and gathering culture by this time the valley was in  much the same geographic state as it exists in today with one  exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the  surface in several areas these springs fed a network of streams  draining through the las vegas wash to the colorado river the areas  surrounding the springs were desert oases sprawling collections of  grasses trees and wildlife many springs lay in areas that would  eventually become the center of the modern las vegas metropolis  for about      years the archaics thrived in a culture that  included many signs of early civilization signs of even more  advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a d when  the anasazi indians inhabited the valley far more progressive than the  archaics the anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as  irrigation to assist their harvest this permitted the anasazi to  achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in  permanent shelters year round without need to follow wildlife  mysteriously the anasazi vanished from the valley around a d  leaving it to be repopulated by the southern paiutes another  hunter gatherer tribe  unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the  anasazi the paiutes were destined to a semi nomadic lifestyle until  european settlers arrived changing the nature of existence in the  valley forever  from mailmen to mormons  in the early nineteenth century america’s western  territories were still largely unexplored it was not until      that  rafael rivera a mexican scout found a spring fed valley and dubbed it  las vegas — a spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering  exactly where “the meadows” really lay  for fifteen years las vegas was used as a spanish trail  way station in      american explorer john c fremont parked his  horses at big springs and his report to the government resulted in a  mail route leading past the spot on its way to california this put las  vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its  history  in      mormon leader brigham young responded to promising  reports of las vegas by sending    missionary settlers to the valley  they eventually built a fort not far from today’s downtown surrounded  by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert the adobe fort became a  focal point for the development of las vegas for the next fifty years  the missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the  desert trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their  circumstances and spread the mormon faith additional pressures from  arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery their  supplies scarce their harvest meager and their spirit broken they  abandoned the fort in  despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver by       most of the mining traffic through las vegas was of prospectors  headed to california or northern nevada in search of gold one  opportunist who stayed was octavius decatur gass bestowed with plenty  of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes las vegas to this  day gass redirected his life by picking up where the mormons left  off — at least when it came to ranching and farming gass took over the  abandoned mormon fort and     acres     hectares surrounding it  dubbing it the las vegas ranch he expanded the ranch and irrigated the  land so that it would support crops and cattle his determination had  other results as well gass was named a justice of the peace and a  territorial legislator  despite his ambition gass’ success was short lived in the  late     s he defaulted on a loan from rancher archibald stewart so  stewart took the las vegas ranch for his own true to wild west  stereotypes stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer leaving his  strong willed wife helen to assume the duties of the ranch through       helen stewart expanded the ranch to      acres     hectares  making quite a bit of money in the process  what happened next would mark the end of the successful las  vegas ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across  almost all of western america to this day the railroad was coming and  when it arrived las vegas would never be the same again  of tracks and tracts  at the turn of the   th century los angeles and salt lake  city were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new american west  though the two cities remained unlinked by rail this was about to  change quickly when it did the las vegas valley which at the time  had a non native population of less than    would change as well  in      officials of the san pedro los angeles and salt  lake railroad arrived in las vegas eager to secure a right of way for  their los angeles–salt lake connection las vegas would serve as a  major stopover for crew rest and train repair for all this the  railroad needed land as mapped the track traveled directly through  helen stewart’s las vegas ranch stewart sold      percent of her ranch  to the railroad the remainder she returned to the native paiutes  in early      the route between los angeles and salt lake  city was completed and train tracks bore right down the center of the  las vegas valley on    may      the railroad held a land sale — a  momentous step in las vegas history standing at the depot at main and  fremont streets railroad officials auctioned      lots they had  subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub land speculators  and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad  boomtown and within an afternoon more than    percent of the lots  were sold  las vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement with  rail service in place and forty blocks of private property it was  ready to become a real town businesses sprang up overnight and wooden  houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early  settlers had lived one year after the auction the population of las  vegas had ballooned to      residents a portent of things to come for  the next ninety years  dam good luck  from the beginning las vegas was built to serve travelers  the railroad needed a way station and las vegas was the place growth  continued for ten years and by      the town had telephones  round the clock electricity and a growing population — many of whom  worked in the railroad repair shop but such heady progress would soon  come to a halt  the growing competition in rail transport resulted in union  pacific buying the los angeles–salt lake line union pacific then  consolidated its operations eliminating the las vegas repair facility  additionally las vegas had been made a part of nevada’s new clark  county in      a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling  these unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate las vegas to the  status of a small desert community that could no longer support its       residents but the southwest’s growing need for water combined  with las vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the colorado river would give  las vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity  construction on hoover dam originally boulder dam  subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project  began in      in a canyon    miles    km southeast of las vegas  providing an influx of     million to the southwestern economy hoover  dam played a major role in preventing las vegas from drying up both  financially and literally not only did it create jobs but it also  created lake mead the massive reservoir that today provides water to  all of southern nevada  more government help  the construction of hoover dam did not single handedly save  las vegas however the state legislature helped as well by legalizing  gambling in      and thus solidifying the future of the town though  legislators and residents could never have known this at the time  the hordes of people who attended hoover dam’s  dedication set the city’s now formidable public relations machine into  action they went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest  citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted it didn’t take long for the  city to establish itself as a wild west town with an “anything goes”  attitude vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal  here available any hour of any day or night thus originated las  vegas’s reputation as an adult theme park  additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from  world war ii both the las vegas aerial gunnery school which became  nellis air force base and the nevada test site in the north and basic  magnesium in the nearby town of henderson arrived in the early     s  as a result of america’s war effort by      the population had grown  to almost        with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace  but this was not yet the las vegas of folklore  mobsters and rat packers  while many gambling halls opened downtown in the     s and  early     s only two were built on the stretch of old los angeles  highway that ultimately became the strip the el rancho vegas  was the first followed by the last frontier      during this  period east coast syndicate member benjamin “bugsy” siegel earned a  foothold as a local casino operator  by      siegel had become one of las vegas’s original  visionaries planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the la  highway when the flamingo opened in december      it did so with  hollywood flair and the new vegas flash but the mafia bosses who  financed the operation were displeased with its performance siegel was  murdered in the summer of  despite its initial failings siegel’s flamingo survived  him as did mob infiltration of casinos in fact the flamingo would  launch over two decades of strong mob presence in las vegas freely  flowing “comps” complimentary food drink and entertainment were the  order of the day with mob bosses content to provide an environment of  pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in  while the mob was running the casinos promoters were  busily selling las vegas as a glamorous hollywood in the desert from  the mid     s to the mid     s las vegas nurtured a growing sense that  it was the “entertainment capital of the world ” emerging stars no  longer content with playing small nightclubs came to las vegas with  dreams of making it big many of them did frank sinatra wayne newton  and louis prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found  themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were  written the rat pack — originally frank sinatra dean martin sammy  davis jr peter lawford and joey bishop all in town to film ocean’s     — landed at the sands in january      for a legendary stay other  hollywood stars came as well simply because las vegas was the place to  be  as a result more casinos emerged along the strip the  thunderbird desert inn sahara sands and riviera hotels were erected  during this period luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of  all night partying exclusive entertainment and cheap accommodations  there was no longer any question when you wanted some unbridled adult  fun las vegas was the place to be  new legitimacy  organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in  its bid to control las vegas — corporate cash though las vegas had  developed a powerful local economy few major outside investments were  made in the city due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent  ties to illegal activities  that would change dramatically with the      arrival of  billionaire howard hughes a legitimate businessman hughes was  nonetheless eccentric and dramatic a style suited to the las vegas  ethos true to the myth the reclusive hughes immediately cloistered  himself in the desert inn’s penthouse several weeks later he was  asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high  rollers whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the  management thus began hughes’ legendary three year     million las  vegas buying spree when it was over hughes owned six casinos an  airport and an airline along with numerous plots of land stretching  from the strip to the mountains  hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions both  immediate and lasting because of the new legitimacy las vegas acquired  from hughes’ investments established companies such as hilton hotels  bought into the gaming business and their influence helped draw a line  in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos where  illegal skimming of profits was rampant that combined with the  formation of the nevada gaming control board would signal the  beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city  las vegas with a vision  as corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out  a new las vegas emerged the legitimization of gambling led to its  increased legalization across the us what was once a sure thing became  much more competitive casino operators had to reassess the nature of  their business  the first to really do so was steve wynn a las vegas  resident and owner of the golden nugget in the mid     s wynn began  plans to reinvigorate las vegas with a new resort he bought several  strip properties — the silver slipper and castaways among them — and  demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — mirage —  which  became an instant success  wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a  trend that more than any other describes las vegas at the end of the    th century removal of old properties in exchange for the potential  of new ones this trend has led to many more demolitions including the  dunes replaced by bellagio aladdin the new aladdin and sands  venetian hotels  wynn’s casinos have also set new standards they can no  longer be just a box filled with gaming tables restaurants and a  showroom excalibur the mgm grand the luxor and new york new york  all followed mirage’s lead during the     s offering themed  environments and attractions for families  as evidence of the “ever faster” nature of the city by the  middle of the     s the new approach showed signs of backlash with  many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the las vegas experience  the latest approach is perhaps the best of the post mob era the  comprehensive resort new resorts offer attractions and amenities  modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide including  luxurious spas signature restaurants and exclusive boutiques  additionally a handful of resorts — such as the south seas  themed mandalay bay the mirage and the new four seasons — are now  catering exclusively to the luxury travel market the crème de la crème  of las vegas deluxe is steve wynn’s bellagio the world’s most  expensive resort at     billion the bellagio’s amenities include    star dining chanel caliber boutiques and a world class collection  of artistic masterworks perhaps more important such high end  accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the  mythology of the rat pack era  as it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming  venue the population of las vegas skyrocketed over        additional  hotel rooms have been added in a few short years including resorts in  summerlin and lake las vegas recent business projections for las vegas  predict challenges tourism revenues must increase substantially to  sustain what is already built while actual figures show visitation as  steady or declining the growth that has characterized las vegas for  nearly a century may be facing a roadblock  still the future of las vegas is sure to be determined as  much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else  with its new look and new aim the prospects are good despite the  warnings inevitably some people will get burned in the process but  others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes  and that more than anything is the one constant that characterizes  the past present and future of las vegas 
  dublin and the dubliners  as capital of europe’s most explosive economy dublin seems  to be changing before your very eyes new construction is everywhere  the streets buzz traffic is increasingly congested and in the  frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in dublin seems intent on changing  places with everyone else at night the streets are crowded with people  bent on having a good time prosperity is in the air the roar of the  “celtic tiger” can clearly be heard  but this is not the whole picture the proverbial  hospitality and warm welcome are still here this busy modern european  city sits on a thousand years of history — history is present  everywhere from elegant merrion square to the bullet holes on the  general post office it’s also a city of the imagination reinvented  and reappraised in the literature of its exiles and the old dublin is  with us too — the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar  magic possessed by ireland and the irish  prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic  preservation dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor you  can view artifacts from the bronze age trace the history of the easter  rising or revisit leopold bloom’s odyssey in ulysses old buildings  are being recycled for example the   th century royal hospital now  holds the museum of modern art and dublin a city large in  expectations is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its  sights on foot  city on the liffey  the river liffey flows from west to east through the center  of the city to dublin bay the river forms a natural line between the  north and south sections of the city this geography is important in  understanding dublin historically and culturally this north south  distinction has always been significant and it still is today with a  dose of good humored rivalry between the two areas “ i never go north  of the liffey ” one man remarked  farther out both north and south are the sweeping curves  of the royal and grand canals the occasional cry of gulls and  unexpected distant vistas will remind you that dublin is by the sea  and the wicklow mountains which hold dublin closely to the coast are  visible from everywhere  dublin is an intimate city physically small but tightly  packed a perfect place for walking college green the home of trinity  college provides a natural focus just south of the o’connell street  bridge o’connell street the city’s grand boulevard leads north to  parnell square to the south and east is st stephen’s green and  georgian dublin where the national museums are located along the  liffey to the west is temple bar center of nightlife and home to many  of dublin’s cutting edge artists and artistic endeavors up the hill  from temple bar are dublin castle and christ church cathedral  it won’t rain on you in dublin all the time the climate  here can best be described as “changeable” and yet the sudden shifts  from light to dark sunshine to shower are part of the city’s magic  buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light dublin  under a lowering sky is a different place from dublin in sunshine  enjoying dublin  literature has always flourished in dublin the only city  to have produced three nobel prize winners for literature — yeats  shaw and beckett joyce the high priest of literary modernism  imagined and interpreted dublin for the world in ulysses you’ll see  references to it all over however sometimes it seems that the city  produced artists of this stature by accident even against its will  beckett and joyce among others had to leave their homeland to  understand it —  and to be understood  dublin theater is legendary and no visitor should miss  seeing a performance at the abbey theatre or gate theatre the city’s  impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of u  and bob  geldof is well known — there’s even a self guided tour of their haunts  traditional irish music is also alive and well especially in the pubs  and there has been a revival of storytelling poetry reading and  traditional dancing and in this city where literature and theater  have historically dominated the scene visual arts are finally coming  into their own with the new museum of modern art and the many galleries  that display the work of modern irish artists  the constantly crowded and busy grafton street is the most  visible center for shopping but there are shops all over that carry an  international array of goods as well as the irish crafts and souvenirs  you expect and while multinational chains have made inroads they seem  less blatant here than elsewhere many shops and also hotels and guest  houses have been owned and managed by the same families for years and  theirs is the welcome of traditional dublin hospitality  dublin’s food has undergone a metamorphosis there was a  time when you might have apologized for it but no longer dublin has  international restaurants galore and the new irish cuisine is built  upon fresh products of ireland’s seas rivers and farms coffee has  replaced the ubiquitous tea — dublin is now almost as much a coffee  city as vienna or seattle  city and countryside  in a city of such human proportions it is not surprising  that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation phoenix  park in the northwest is the largest open space but squares like st  stephen’s green are the garden oases of the city  on the coast sandymount dollymount and killiney strands  are the places to go the beautiful wicklow mountains and the wicklow  mountains national park provide a more rugged countryside and the area  has breathtaking houses and gardens such as castletown mount usher  and powerscourt to the north and west are the ancient sites of  ireland malahide castle the evocative hill of tara and the long  barrows of knowth and newgrange  the dart dublin area rapid transit runs north and south  along the coast it’s an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying  sights and villages there are many guided bus tours to sights outside  the city and some are accessible by city bus  young at heart  dublin is a young city almost half of ireland’s population  is under twenty five and with its universities and professional  schools dublin also has a large student population the universities  attract students from all over the world and this influx helps to make  dublin a busy buzzing international city however young and old  stranger and dubliner rub shoulders quite happily religion and respect  for parents has not yet gone out of fashion and young graduates are  not leaving now — multinational corporations and european union  investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home  unemployment is at an all time low the irish are actually beginning to  come home 
  hong kong and  its people  exciting mysterious glamorous — these words have described  hong kong for at least a century with its vibrant atmosphere and  night and day activity it is an intoxicating place hong kong is  crowded — it has one of the world’s greatest population densities but  it is also efficient with one of the best transportation systems  anywhere and for such a crowded place quiet — you don’t hear voices  raised in anger motorists sitting on their horns or loud boomboxes  shopping never ends — there’s always another inviting spot just down  the street you’ll find hong kong easy to get around the people  helpful english spoken everywhere and food that lives up to its  reputation  on   july      the british crown colony of hong kong  reverted to chinese sovereignty as a special administrative region of  the people’s republic of china today hong kong remains a capitalist  enclave with its laws and rights intact and china has promised that  hong kong will continue in this fashion for at least    years  beijing’s announced policy of maintaining hong kong’s prosperity and  stability makes sense hong kong has long been china’s handiest window  on the west and the city is unrivaled in its commercial know how and  managerial expertise around the time of the transition there was much  speculation about how things would change but in fact once news of  the handover vanished from the front pages the people of hong kong  returned to their usual topics of conversation the economy and the  price of housing  the impression of the visitor today will be that very little  has changed establishments are no longer called “royal ” queen  elizabeth has vanished from the coinage and the union jack has been  replaced by the flag of china and the new hong kong flag with its  bauhinia flower but in fact there have been changes many of them due  to economic progress new construction and other factors that  influence cities all over the world  others are more subtle british social customs are still  evident in the kind of polite service you get in hotels and in the long  lines of people waiting for buses at rush hour the british population  has decreased today there are as many american and australian ex pats  as there are british  with a population of nearly eight million and a total area  of just over       square km     square miles housing is one of hong  kong’s perennial nightmares to alleviate the problem the government  has become the city’s major landlord with the construction of massive  apartment blocks that though they have every modern facility average  only   square m     square ft in size whole cities have been created  in the new territories although the unimaginative architecture of  these towns has been criticized  of hong kong’s population    percent are chinese the  majority are cantonese born in hong kong or from south china but  there are immigrants from all over china the chinese people have been  described as hardworking and pragmatic attitudes that have contributed  to hong kong’s success there are many stories of refugees who arrived  with nothing in their pockets set up a small sidewalk stall worked  diligently until they had their own store and then expanded it into a  modest chain  old customs are still followed fate and luck are taken very  seriously and astrologers and fortune tellers do a steady business  before a skyscraper can be built a feng shui see page  investigation must take place to ensure that the site and the building  will promote health harmony and prosperity you’ll also notice that  gambling is a passion whether it be cards mah jong the lottery or  the horses hong kong has two major racetracks as well as an intensive  off track betting system and on weekends the ferries to macau are  crowded with people on their way to the casinos  sightseeing in hong kong starts at sea level with the  enthralling water traffic — a mix of freighters ferries tugs junks  and yachts views of the city and the harbor are panoramic from  victoria peak hong kong’s highest point or from skyscrapers and  hotels they are especially exciting at night when the lights are  on  the business and financial center and the signature soaring  architecture are on hong kong island across victoria harbor connected  by ferry and the mtr rail line is the kowloon peninsula with its  hotels nightlife and almost non stop shopping beyond in the new  territories are a mixture of high rise suburban towns ancient sites  and walled villages country parks and farms with ducks and fish  ponds hong kong’s other less developed islands lantau lamma and  cheung chau provide getaways you can also take a ferry to macau to  find an entirely different kind of city a unique blend of chinese and  iberian culture  it’s anyone’s guess what may happen in the future but for  now hong kong bristles with energy and ambition and for the visitor  this beautiful city with its contrasts and variety is an exhilarating  experience 
  where to go  t he crowded kowloon peninsula and the booming new  territories on the mainland call for some serious sightseeing but we  begin across victoria harbor on hong kong island where the city was  first founded and which remains the center of government business and  commerce  hong kong central  no matter how many tunnels and transit systems speed  cross harbor traffic nothing matches the ride on the star ferry from  kowloon to the central district across victoria harbor as the  double decker boats get ready to leave the pier bells ring the  gangplank is raised deckhands in blue sailor suits man the hawsers  and a couple of hundred commuters begin a seven minute sightseeing  tour the big green and white boat weaves its way through an  ever changing obstacle course of both large and

now functions as a cultural  center go through the underground walkway to statue square on the  east side of the square is the legislative council building one of the  few colonial buildings left in hong kong so great is the pressure on  the available land that most of hong kong’s colonial architectural  heritage has been demolished and replaced by new skyscrapers despite  protests by preservationists there was little alternative  nearby is chater garden and a number of notable  architectural landmarks most famous is the striking    story i m pei  bank of china tower not beloved by the people of hong kong — its  triangular prisms and sharp angles violate the principles of feng shui  see box page    and its radio masts stick up like an insect’s  antennae the rival hong kong and shanghai bank is by architect norman  foster built on a “coathanger frame ” its floors hang rather than  ascend from inside the vast atrium you can view the whole structure as  well as the mechanical workings of the building two bronze lions  carrying out feng shui principles guard its doors  you can catch one of hong kong’s historic trams along des  voeux road and ride from central to causeway

colonial building with exhibits describing the history of tea from the  warring states period    –    b c to the present  if you leave the park and walk up cotton tree drive you  will find the peak tram terminal  to the summit  for more than a century the most exhilarating way up  victoria peak has been by funicular the peak tram starts its scenic  climb just across the street and around the corner from the american  consulate in garden road and makes its way sometimes at a startlingly  steep incline to the summit at     m       ft the right of way  travels past fancy apartment blocks bamboo stands and jungle flowers  passengers crane their necks for dizzying glimpses of the harbor the  peak is still the most fashionable place to live in hong kong but real  estate prices here are astronomical rents run around hk        a  month  the peak tram originally steam powered was built to speed  the wealthy taipans to their mountainside retreats before the tram was  built sedan chairs and rickshaws were the only way to get here since  the tram’s inauguration in      it has stopped only for typhoons and  world war ii  the modern     passenger cars make the journey in around  eight minutes however on sunny saturdays and sundays you may have to  brave a crowd lining up at the lower terminal during the spring and  autumn festivals when people traditionally seek out the hilltops the  throngs are so large you would be better advised to try another  time  at the upper terminus there is a four level shopping  center the peak galleria and the peak tower which resembles an  airport control tower and has shops entertainment and  restaurants  you can walk around the peak for impressive views of hong  kong the coastline and the islands in    minutes on lugard and  harlech roads the view is especially effective at night there are  also souvenir stands benches for a rest and perhaps hong kong’s last  surviving rickshaws — however these are not for rides but are a
