ABSTRACT
Background: In 2007 the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)
and the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR) issued 8
recommendations (plus 2 special recommendations) on diet, physical
activity, and weight management for cancer prevention on the
basis of the most comprehensive collection of available evidence.
Objective: We aimed to investigate whether concordance with the
WCRF/AICR recommendations was related to cancer risk in the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC) study.
Design: The present study included 386,355 EPIC participants from
9 European countries. At recruitment, dietary, anthropometric, and
lifestyle information was collected. A score was constructed based
on the WCRF/AICR recommendations on weight management,
physical activity, foods and drinks that promote weight gain, plant
foods, animal foods, alcoholic drinks, and breastfeeding for women;
the score range was 0–6 for men and 0–7 for women. Higher scores
indicated greater concordance with WCRF/AICR recommendations.
The association between the score and cancer risk was estimated
by using multivariable Cox regression models.
Results: Concordance with the score was significantly associated
with decreased risk of cancer. A 1-point increment in the score was
associated with a risk reduction of 5% (95% CI: 3%, 7%) for total
cancer, 12% (95% CI: 9%, 16%) for colorectal cancer, and 16%
(95% CI: 9%, 22%) for stomach cancer. Significant associations
were also observed for cancers of the breast, endometrium, lung,
kidney, upper aerodigestive tract, liver, and esophagus but not for
prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, and bladder cancers.
Conclusion: Adherence to the WCRF/AICR recommendations for
cancer prevention may lower the risk of developing most types of
cancer. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;96:150–63.
INTRODUCTION
Dietary and lifestyle guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular
diseases and health maintenance have been the basis for
the development of several index scores. Results from several
studies have shown that some of the well-known index scores—
such as the Healthy Eating Index, the Diet Quality Index, and the
Recommended Food Score, and modifications of these index
scores—have little or no association with overall cancer risk and/

or mortality (1–7). On the other hand, some (8–15), but not all
(16–18), studies have shown a stronger association with cancer
incidence and mortality for dietary index scores that also incorporate
other lifestyle factors such as weight management,
physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Nevertheless,
a few studies showed that the association of lifestyle
scores with cancer risk was attenuated when the body fatness and
physical activity components of the score were excluded, indicating
that these 2 components probably explained most of the
observed effect of the score on cancer risk (8, 14).
One of the reasons why some indexes failed to show a predictive
value for cancer risk and/or mortality could be that most
indexes were based on recommendations for prevention of cardiovascular
disease or general health. Only 2 previous studies
have specifically tested indexes based on cancer prevention
recommendations [the 1997 American Institute for Cancer
Research Recommendations (14) and the American Cancer
Society cancer prevention guidelines (15)]: in both studies,
scores based on these recommendations showed significant associations
with total cancer incidence (14) and mortality (14, 15);
however, neither these nor other studies had enough power to
examine the association of health recommendations with specific
cancer types that might be more closely related to certain lifestyle
factors than others.
In 2007 the World Cancer Research Fund and the American
Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR)5 issued 8 general
and 2 special recommendations on diet, physical activity, and
weight management for cancer prevention on the basis of the
most comprehensive collection of available evidence (19). Previous
research based on the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) has contributed to elucidate
the associations between these lifestyle factors individually and
cancer risk (20). In the present study, we assessed whether a
composite measure of a healthy lifestyle based on the 2007
WCRF/AICR recommendations for cancer prevention is related
to the risk of developing total and specific types of cancer in
EPIC.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population
A total of 521,330 men and women, aged 25–70 y, were
recruited between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 2000 from 23
centers in 10 European countries: Denmark (Aarhus and
Copenhagen), France, Germany (Heidelberg and Potsdam),
Greece, Italy (Florence, Naples, Ragusa, Turin, and Varese), the
Netherlands (Bilthoven and Utrecht), Norway, Spain (Asturias,
Granada, Murcia, Navarra, and San Sebastian), Sweden (Malmo¨
and Umea°), and the United Kingdom (Cambridge and Oxford).
The French cohort encompassed members of a health insurance
plan for school and university employees. Participants at the
Spanish and Italian centers (except Florence) included blood
donors, members of several health insurance programs, employees
of several enterprises, civil servants, and the general
population. In Utrecht and Florence, participants enrolled in
mammographic screening programs were recruited for the study.
In Oxford, most of the cohort consisted of “health-conscious”
subjects from England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland,
many of whom were vegetarians. Participants were recruited
from the general population in other centers. The cohorts of
France, Norway, Utrecht, and Naples included only women.
Approval for this study was obtained from the ethical review
boards of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and
from all local institutions where subjects had been recruited for
the EPIC study. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants before entry into the EPIC study. The details of
the study design used in the EPIC study have been described
elsewhere (21, 22).
We excluded participants who did not complete the lifestyle
(n = 1465) or dietary (n = 5437) questionnaires, participants
within the lowest and highest 1% of the cohort distribution of
the ratio of reported total energy intake to energy requirements
(n = 10,241), participants who were diagnosed with cancer
(excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) before enrollment (n =
22,860), participants with missing date of diagnosis (n = 13),
and participants with incomplete follow-up information (n =
4002). For the present study, we also excluded pregnant women
(n = 535) and participants with missing data on the following
variables: weight or height (n = 4271), physical activity [n =
65,402, including all participants from Umea° (Sweden) and
(PL); the Bureau of Epidemiologic Research, Academy of Athens, Athens,

Norway where this information was not collected in sufficient
detail], and women with no information on breastfeeding or duration
of breastfeeding (n = 20,479, including all female participants
from Bilthoven, Netherlands, where this information was
not collected). Therefore, 386,355 participants (126,257 men and
260,098 women) were included in the present study.
Data collection and dietary questionnaires
At baseline, participants filled out extensive medical, dietary,
and lifestyle questionnaires, including questions on alcohol use,
smoking status, physical activity, education, reproductive history,
breastfeeding, exogenous hormone use, and previous illnesses.
Body weight and height were measured in all centers except for
Oxford (health-conscious population) and France where anthropometric
measurements were self-reported (23). Usual food
intakes were measured by using country-specific validated dietary
questionnaires (24), and individual nutrient intakes were
derived from foods included in the dietary questionnaires through
the standardized EPIC Nutrient Database (25). To correct for any
systematic under- or overestimation of dietary intake between
the study centers, a dietary calibration study was conducted. A
random sample of 36,308 men and women (7.4% of the sample)
completed a detailed computerized 24-h dietary recall, and nutrient
intake was calculated by using the standardized EPIC
Nutrient Database (26). Dietary exposures across centers were
scaled by using an additive calibration model (24). Briefly, the
differences between the sex- and center-specific means of the
values from the dietary questionnaire and the means of the 24-h
recall values were calculated and added to the questionnaire
values. All dietary variables used in the present study were calibrated
by using additive calibration.
WCRF/AICR score construction
An index score reflecting concordance with the WCRF/
AICR recommendations for cancer prevention was constructed
(WCRF/AICR score). Of 10 recommendations (components),
the following 7 in women (and 6 in men) could be used for
the construction of the score: body fatness, physical activity,
consumption of foods and drinks that promote weight gain,
consumption of plant foods, consumption of animal foods, consumption
of alcoholic drinks, and breastfeeding in women. The
recommendation on preservation, processing, and preparation of
foods was not included in this score because sufficient data were
not available. The special recommendation related to cancer
survivors was excluded because the index was derived from
recommendations for cancer prevention. The recommendation
“Don’t use supplements to protect against cancer” was excluded
because it could not be operationalized in terms of cancer prevention
without further assumptions about type or dose of supplementation.
The score assigned for each component was 1 when
the recommendation was met. An intermediate category (0.5
points) was created to appraise a higher proportion of the variability
in the population. All other individuals received 0 points.
Some recommendations had several subrecommendations: each
subrecommendation was scored and the component score was the
average of the subrecommendation scores. The score was constructed
by using as cutoffs quantitative criteria provided in the
WCRF/AICR recommendations. In some cases, arbitrary a priori
cutoffs (not based on the distribution of the variable in our sample)
were defined for intermediate categories. The scoring system was
based in the premise that each major recommendation should
contribute equally to the total WCRF/AICR score. The scores
obtained for each component were added to calculate a single score
for each study participant. The maximum score was 7 points in
women and 6 points inmen (the recommendation on breastfeeding
is applicable only to women). Higher scores indicated greater
concordance with the WCRF/AICR recommendations. The score
was further categorized into 5 categories according to predefined
cutoffs: category 1 (0–2 points in men; 0–3 points in women),
category 2 (.2 to ,3 in men; .3 to ,4 in women), category 3
(3 to ,4 in men; 4 to ,5 in women), category 4 (4 to ,5 in men;
5 to ,6 in women), and category 5 (5–6 in men; 6–7 in women).
With this categorization, the minimal score difference between the
first and fifth categories was 3 points for both men and women.
Detailed information on the operationalization of the score can
be found in Table 1 (27–29).
Case ascertainment
Cancer cases were identified through population cancer registries
in Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom. In France, Germany, and Greece, a combination
of methods was used including health insurance records,
cancer pathology registries, and active follow-up of study participants
and their next of kin. Follow-up began at the date of
enrollment and ended at the date of diagnosis of cancer, death, or
last complete follow-up. Cancer incidence data were coded
according to the 10th revision of the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death (30) and
the second revision of the International Classification of Diseases
for Oncology (31). Only the first primary neoplasm was included
in the analysis. Nonmelanoma skin cancer was excluded from the
analysis.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics relied on cross-tabulations, showing
percentages within groups for categorical variables as well as
group means and SDs for continuous variables.
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the
association between the WCRF/AICR score and total cancer
risk. Age was used as the primary time variable, with entry time
defined as the subject’s age at recruitment and exit time as age at
diagnosis of cancer, censoring, or death (whichever came first).
All analyses were stratified by age at recruitment to control for
length of follow-up, by center to control for center effects such as
follow-up procedures and questionnaire design, and by sex
(except in sex-specific analyses). The WCRF/AICR score was
assessed as a continuous variable (1-point increment) and as a
categorical variable (using the 5 predefined categories). The
WCRF/AICR categorical variable was scored from 1 to 5, and
trend tests were calculated on these scores. All models were
adjusted for educational level (as a categorical variable: no education,
primary school, technical school, secondary school, and
university degree), presence of chronic diseases at baseline
[including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke (yes, no)],
smoking status and intensity of smoking (never; former: quit
smoking .20 y ago, quit 11–20 y ago, quit 10 y ago; smoker:

1–15 cigarettes/d, 16–25 cigarettes/d, .25 cigarettes/d; smoker,
pipe or cigar), menopausal status (postmenopausal, perimenopausal,
premenopausal, surgical postmenopausal), ever use of
hormone replacement therapy (yes, no), ever use of contraception
pills (yes, no), age at menarche (,12, 12–15, .15 y), parity
(yes, no), age at first full-time pregnancy (,21 y, 21–30 y, .30 y,
nulliparous), and total energy intake (continuous). We included
participants with missing data for the confounding variables as
a separate category for these variables.
We calculated the population attributable fraction (PAF%) and
95% CIs to estimate the proportion of total cancer in this cohort
that hypothetically would not have occurred if all participants
were in the highest category of the score, with the assumption of
a causal relation. We compared participants in the highest category
of the score with the rest of the study participants. For these
analyses, we estimated HRs from multivariate Cox regression
models (32).
The association between the WCRF/AICR score and risk of
developing specific cancer types was also calculated by using
Cox regression models with the same level of adjustment as
specified above. The specific cancer types considered were breast,
ovarian, endometrial, prostate, colorectal, lung, bladder, pancreas,
kidney, stomach, upper aerodigestive tract, liver, and esophageal
cancers. In thesemodels, theWCRF/AICR score was assessed both
continuously (per 1-point increment) and categorically (using 4
predefined categories; categories 4 and 5 were combined into
a single category because of the low number of cases in the
highest category).
Potential effect modifications by baseline BMI category (BMI,
in kg/m2: ,25, 25 to ,30, and 30) and smoking status (former
smokers, current smokers, and never smokers) were explored by
modeling interaction terms (cross-products) between these variables
(categorically) and the WCRF/AICR score (continuous)
and by conducting stratified analyses. The effect modification by
smoking status was assessed for both smoking-related cancers
(lung, bladder, upper aerodigestive tract, kidney, stomach, esophagus,
pancreas, liver, and colorectal) and non-smoking-related
cancers (ie, cancer risk is not increased by smoking: breast and
endometrial cancer in women and prostate cancer in men) (29).
Sensitivity analyses were performed after excluding participants
with presence of chronic diseases at baseline (type 2 diabetes,
heart disease, and stroke) and after excluding the first 2 y of
follow-up. Potential heterogeneity between countries in the association
between the WCRF/AICR score and total cancer risk
was assessed by calculating country-specific estimates and using
random-effects meta-analyses (I2).
We estimated the individual association of each component of
the WCRF/AICR score with total cancer risk, after adjustment for
all other components of the score. Also, we evaluated the relative
importance of each of the components of the WCRF/AICR score
on total cancer risk by subtracting alternately one component at
a time from the original score and including this component as
a covariate in the model. We also assessed the association of the
WCRF/AICR score with total cancer risk after excluding simultaneously
the body fatness and physical activity components.
To be able to compare the risk estimates of the different scores,
the total WCRF/AICR score and the alternative scores were
assessed as continuous variables by increments of 1 SD.
All statistical analyses were performed with STATA 10.0
(StataCorp) and SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc).
RESULTS
After a median follow-up time of 11.0 y (follow-up of
4,243,586 person-years), 36,994 cancer cases were identified in
the EPIC cohort (13,838 in men and 23,156 in women). The
distribution and characteristics of the study population by the 5
predefined categories of the WCRF/AICR score can be found in
Table 2. Men and women within the highest categories of the
score were more likely to be younger and to have a higher educational
level and less likely to be current smokers and to have
a chronic disease at baseline. Women within the highest categories
of the score were more likely to have ever used contraceptive
pills and to be premenopausal and less likely to have
ever used hormonal replacement therapy and to be nulliparous.
The results of the association between the WCRF/AICR score
and risk of total cancer and specific cancer types are shown in
Table 3 and Figure 1. Overall, a 1-point increment in the score
was associated with a 5% (95% CI: 3%, 7%) lower risk of developing
any cancer. Compared with the first category of the
score, the multiple adjusted HRs (95% CI) for total cancer risk
observed in the second, third, fourth, and fifth categories of the
score were 0.94 (0.89, 0.98), 0.88 (0.84, 0.92), 0.91 (0.85, 0.97),
and 0.84 (0.72, 0.99) in men; the corresponding HRs (95% CI)
in women were 0.95 (0.92, 0.98), 0.91 (0.88, 0.94), 0.89 (0.85,
0.93), and 0.81 (0.72, 0.91) (P-trend , 0.0001 in both men and
women). The risk reduction in participants within the fourth and
fifth categories of the score compared with those within the first
category was 16% for breast, 27% for colorectal, 14% for lung,
23% for endometrial, 29% for kidney, 38% for stomach, 31% for
upper aerodigestive tract, 15% for liver, and 42% for esophageal
cancer (P-trend , 0.05). Higher scores were not significantly associated
with lower risk of ovarian, prostate, bladder, or pancreas
cancer. Overall, 12.6% (95% CI of the PAF%: 3.6%, 21.4%) of all
cancers could have been prevented if the whole study population
was classified within the fifth category of the score (5–6 points in
men and 6–7 points in women; data not shown).
No evidence of effect modification by smoking status (Pinteraction
= 0.261 in men and 0.692 in women) was observed
(Table 4); however, among men, no significant association between
the WCRF/AICR score and total cancer risk was observed
among never smokers. This potential effect modification by
smoking status was further assessed for smoking-related and
non-smoking-related cancers. In men, the score was significantly
associated with a lower risk of smoking-related cancers (lung,
bladder, upper aerodigestive tract, kidney, stomach, esophagus,
pancreas, liver, and colorectal) in never, former, and current
smokers; for non-smoking-related cancers (mainly prostate
cancer), no significant association with the score was observed
in any of the categories of smoking status. Among women, the
score was associated with lower risk of both smoking-related
and non-smoking-related (mainly breast and endometrial) cancers
in all categories of smoking status, although the association
was slightly stronger for smoking-related cancers.
No evidence of effect modification by BMI category was
observed (P-interaction = 0.234 in men and 0.596 in women).
The HRs for total cancer risk did not change when persons with
chronic diseases at baseline were excluded [HR (95% CI) per
1-point increment in the score: 0.95 (0.93, 0.97) in men and 0.96
(0.95, 0.97) in women] or when the first 2 y of follow-up were
excluded [HR (95% CI) per 1-point increment in the score: 0.95

(0.93, 0.97) in men and 0.96 (0.95, 0.97) in women; data not
shown]. No heterogeneity in the association between the WCRF/
AICR score and cancer risk among countries was observed in
men (P-heterogeneity = 0.724) (Figure 2A). Among women,
P-heterogeneity was 0.014 (Figure 2B); however, in all countries
inverse associations between the score and cancer risk were
observed, indicating that heterogeneity was due to differences in
the strength of the association rather than the direction.
The mutually adjusted HRs for total cancer incidence associated
with the individual components of the WCRF/AICR score
are shown in Table 5. In the overall sample (men and women
combined), all of the components of the score were significantly
associated with cancer risk, except for the component “foods
that promote weight gain.” In sex-specific analyses, total cancer
risk was inversely associated with the components “plant foods,”
“red and processed meat,” and “alcohol intake” in men and with

DISCUSSION
In this European population, individuals with a lifestyle in
concordance with the WCRF/AICR recommendations on diet,
physical activity, and body fatness for cancer prevention were
less likely to develop most types of cancers. Overall, participants
within the highest category of the WCRF/AICR score (5 points
in men and 6 points in women) were 18% less likely to develop
any cancer compared with those in the first category of the
score (2 points in men and 3 points in women), and there
was a significantly lower cancer risk observed even in the second
category of the score.
Advantages of the present study include its very large sample
size and the large number of incident cancers included, which
provided enough power to study the association of the WCRF/
AICR score with total cancer as well as specific cancer-type risks
and allowed us to perform several sensitivity analyses. Second,
we constructed an easily replicable index score that reflected
most of the WCRF/AICR recommendations for cancer prevention
by using objective cutoffs to operationalize each recommendation
and by including intermediate categories to
increase the discriminatory power of the score. Participants with
higher WCRF/AICR scores were more likely to be nonsmokers,

of smoking in former smokers (.20 y ago, 11–20 y ago, 10 y ago, unknown/missing), number of cigarettes per day among smokers (1–15 cigarettes, 16–25
cigarettes, .25 cigarettes, pipe or cigar, unknown/missing), and presence of chronic diseases at baseline (no, yes, missing). Models for women were further
adjusted for ever use of contraceptive pills (no, yes, missing), ever use of hormone replacement therapy (no, yes, missing), age at first menarche (,12 y, 12
to 15 y, .15 y, missing), age at first pregnancy (,21 y, 21 to 30 y, .30 y, nulliparous), and menopausal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal,

were more educated, and were generally chronic disease–free,
indicating that the score reflected an overall healthy lifestyle.
A significant association between the WCRF/AICR score and
cancer risk was observed after excluding alternatively each
component of the score at a time, even when both physical activity
and BMI were excluded, indicating that the combination of
all components was responsible of the observed association with
cancer risk. In addition, all of the components of the score were
significantly associated with cancer risk after mutual adjustment
for each other, except for the component “foods that promote
weight gain.” The lack of association of this component with
cancer risk could be explained by the fact that the component
“body fatness” was already included in the model, and BMI is
likely to be in the etiologic pathway between this recommendation
and cancer risk. Finally, an inverse association between the
WCRF/AICR score and cancer risk was observed in all countries
included in the EPIC study, and for most cancer types.
The main limitation of this study is related to the use of
a simple score index based on the sum of several risk factors that
are not associated with the risk of developing all cancer types,
which may have attenuated the association of the score in cancerspecific
analyses. In addition, the inclusion of cancer types that
are unrelated to lifestyle factors may dilute the effect of the risk
factor–specific analyses. Several other limitations should also be
mentioned: EPIC, like many other cohorts, is not a populationbased
cohort and the consequence of this is that there is a “healthy
effect.” Therefore, the preventable fraction in the general population
is likely to be higher than the one reported here.We could

model of both sexes combined and adjusted for energy intake (kcal), level of education (none, primary school, technical/
professional school, secondary school, university degree, unknown/missing), smoking status and intensity of smoking
(never; former: quit smoking .20 y ago, quit 11–20 y ago, quit 10 y ago; smoker: 1–15 cigarettes/d, 16–25 cigarettes/
d, .25 cigarettes/d; smoker, pipe or cigar; missing current or former status; unknown/missing), and presence of
chronic diseases at baseline (no, yes, missing). Models for women were further adjusted for ever use of contraceptive pills
(no, yes, missing), ever use of hormone replacement therapy (no, yes, missing), age at first menarche (,12 y, 12 to 15 y,
.15 y, missing), age at first pregnancy (,21 y, 21 to 30 y, .30 y, nulliparous), and menopausal status (premenopausal,
postmenopausal, perimenopausal, and surgical postmenopausal). All components were mutually adjusted for each other. P

not include all WCRF/AICR recommendations in our score,
because either there were not enough data available or they were
not applicable to the objectives of this study; therefore, the
WCRF/AICR score constructed by us may underestimate the
potential impact of adhering to these recommendations. In addition,
some lifestyle factors related to diet, physical activity, and
body fatness that have been associated with cancer risk were not
included in the score because they were not part of the WCRF/
AICR recommendations; for example, abdominal adiposity measurements,
such as waist circumference, may be better predictors
of some cancer types [eg, colorectal (33) or pancreatic (34)]
compared with measurements of general obesity such as BMI. On
the other hand, the score incorporates risk factors that are not
directly associated with cancer risk, such as “foods that promote
weight gain” or “being underweight.” Although very standardized
and detailed dietary and lifestyle questionnaires were used in the
EPIC study, measurement error and misclassification may have
biased the estimates toward the null. The multivariate analyses
were adjusted for lifestyle factors that were associated with both
the score and cancer risk; however, we cannot rule out the possibility
of residual confounding associated with exposure measurement
errors. No evidence of effect modification by smoking
status or BMI was detected, and the association did not change
after excluding those with chronic diseases at baseline; nevertheless,
a null association between the score and total cancer risk
was observed among men who had never smoked. This could
either be a chance finding, be due to residual confounding by
smoking status, or indicate a stronger protection among those
exposed to tobacco smoking, as previously reported (35, 36);
nevertheless, we should bear in mind that a large percentage of the
cancers among never-smoking men were prostate cancer (a nonsmoking-
related cancer), which has very weak ties to diet and
lifestyle factors, and so could partly explain the lack of association
in never smokers with non-smoking-related cancers as well.
In 1981 Doll and Peto (37) estimated that 35% (95% CI: 10%,
70%) of all cancer deaths could be prevented through diet. More
recently, the WCRF/AICR estimated that diet, nutrition, physical
activity, and body fatness accounted for 26% (95% CI: 6%, 42%)
of all cancers (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in the United
Kingdom. The corresponding PAF% (95% CI) calculated for
the United States, Brazil, and China were 24% (7%, 40%), 19%
(3%, 31%), and 20% (5%, 37%) (38). In a previous observational
prospective study conducted in women (the Iowa Women’s
Health Study), it was estimated that the PAF% for not following
6–9 of the 1997 AICR recommendations for cancer prevention
was 22% (95% CI: 12%, 30%) (14). Other epidemiologic studies
have calculated the PAF% for cancer incidence and/or cancer
mortality associated with combinations of several lifestyle factors—
ie, diet, physical activity, obesity, and smoking—and observed
a PAF% within the 19–60% range (9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 39, 40). In the
present study we estimated that lack of adherence to the WCRF/
AICR recommendations was associated with a PAF% of 13% (95%
CI: 4%, 21%) for total cancer incidence. The corresponding PAF%
observed when avoidance of smoking was considered together with
theWCRF/AICR recommendations was 23% (95% CI: 14%, 32%;
data not shown). These values are somehow lower than previously
reported. Themain reason for that could be related to the distribution
of the exposure in the present population, given that it mostly
comprised volunteers participating in the EPIC study and was
hence more likely to be healthier than the general population; in
addition, the use of an overall score incorporating most WCRF/
AICR recommendations for cancer prevention with equal weight
given to each recommendation, and the inclusion of all cancer
types in the calculation independently of their association with
lifestyle factors, may have resulted in a conservative estimate.
The WCRF/AICR score did not predict the risk of cancers of
the prostate, ovary, pancreas, and bladder. These null associations
are consistent with what was reported in the WCRF/AICR 2007
report (19) as well as what was found in previous studies conducted
within EPIC. In EPIC, no clear associations were observed
between the risk of prostate cancer and physical activity
(41), BMI (42), fiber intake (43), alcohol intake (44), red and
processed meat consumption (45), and fruit and vegetable consumption
(46). According to the WCRF/AICR 2007 report, there
is convincing evidence for an association between body fatness
and probably abdominal fatness with pancreatic cancer risk.
In EPIC, BMI was not significantly associated with risk of
pancreatic cancer, but significant associations were observed
for waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (34), which are
markers of abdominal adiposity that are not directly incorporated
as part of the WCRF/AICR score. No significant association
between physical activity (34), ethanol intake (47), or fruit and
vegetable consumption (48) and pancreatic cancer risk has been
observed in EPIC. The WCRF/AICR 2007 report concluded that
there is very limited evidence to link any aspect of diet, nutrition,
physical activity, and body fatness to risks of either bladder or
ovarian cancer. Null results have been mostly reported in EPIC
regarding the association of these lifestyle factors and bladder
cancer (49, 50) or ovarian cancer risk (51, 52), except for a
positive association between obesity (BMI .30) and ovarian
cancer risk in postmenopausal women (53).
In conclusion, results of this study suggest that following the
WCRF/AICR recommendations on diet, nutrition, physical activity,
and weight management for cancer prevention is associated
with a lower risk of developing most types of cancer in
European populations. More research is needed to elucidate other
potential lifestyle risk factors for cancer and how modification of
these lifestyle factors could prevent cancer.
