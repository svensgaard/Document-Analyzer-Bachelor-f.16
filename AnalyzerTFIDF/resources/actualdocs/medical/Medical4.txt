Abstract--A transplanted murine ovarian tumor (MS076/73A, M5, of C57B1/6
origin) with unique metastatic potential is described. After i.m. or s.c. inoculation of
the M5 ovarian tumor, spontaneous metastases were consistently observed in liver,
spleen, kidney, ovary and uterus, but lung lesions were not usually found. Even after
i.v. inoculation the tumor showed a selective tropism ./'or the abdominal organs
mentioned. When M5 ovarian carcinoma cells were injected i.p., the tumor grew a~
scattered lesions in the abdomen and resulted in carcinomatous ascites. Surgical excision
of i.m. tumors as early as 5days after implantation Jailed to protect mice against
metastases, suggesting early widespread dissemination from the primary lesion. The
tumor was poorly immunogenic as assessed by in vivo immunization with irradiated
cells and by concomitant immunity experiments.
INTRODUCTION
THE CAPACITY of tumor cells to disseminate
to and grow at different anatomical
sites is a crucial characteristic in malignancy,
but the mechanisms involved in metastasis
formation remain largely to be defined [1-4].
Appropriate models of cancer cell dissemination
and metastasis are indispensable if any
progress is to be made in this area. There are
now a number of well characterized transplanted
murine tumors spontaneously metastasizing
to the lungs through the hematogenous
route [5-7]. Inoculation of tumor cells
at specific anatomical sites such as the tibia
[8], testicle [9, 10] and pinna of the ear [2]
results in lymph node metastasis, and transplanted
murine carcinomas spreading to regional
lymph nodes and lungs have been
characterized [ 11-13].
In the present paper, we describe a transplanted
murine ovarian tumor with a unique
pattern of metastasization. After s.c. or
i.m. inoculation of the tumor, secondary deposits
were consistently observed at various

visceral organs (liver, spleen, kidney, ovary
and uterus) but usually there were no lung
lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Female C57B1/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were
obtained from Charles River, Calco, Italy.
~TUmOT
The M5076/73A (M5) ovarian tuinor (Fig.
1) was obtained through the courtesy of Dr.
A. Bogden tMason Res. Inst., Worcester,
MA). The tumor, histologically an anaplastic
carcinoma, arose spontaneously in one
C57B1/6 mouse in Dr. W. F. Dunnfng's laboratory,
Papanicolao Cancer Research lust.,
Miami, FL. The tumor was maintained by
s.c. passage with trocars every 3-4 weeks and
was used at its 2nd-5th passage in this
laboratory.
Growth
Tumors obtained 2-3 weeks after implantation
were minced with scissors and disaggregated
by exposure to trypsin (0.3¢~/o) in
basal medium Eagle (BME) for 45rain at
37°C. The cells were washed twice with 50 ml
BME and finally resuspended in BME.
