Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 18 February 2000 .
Statement by the President
Ladies and gentlemen , as you know , on 22 February , ETA struck again in a brutal attack in Spain with the murder of Fernando Buesa Blanco , the General Secretary of the Socialist Party of Vizcaya and the spokesman of the Socialist Party of the Basque Parliament , and Jorge Díez Elorza , his bodyguard .
The same day , I conveyed my own and the European Parliament ' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims ' families .
These men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy .
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society .
The rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based .
Terrorism , whatever form it takes , is unacceptable .
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA , I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain .
I would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to observe one minute ' s silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza .
( The House rose and observed a minute ' s silence )
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I want to thank you for your statement last Tuesday and for your words today in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco .
He was a member of the Basque regional parliament , spokesman for the Socialist Party in that parliament and also a former vice-president of the Basque regional government .
Madam President , the best tribute that my Group and this House can pay to Fernando Buesa is to take on board his vision , as a European , of the Basque Country , Spain and Europe .
The following is a translated extract from his autobiography . ' We are in Europe .
Anyone of my age - I am 54 - can remember their grandparents ' era and their parents ' era and , of course , is living in the current era . We can also see into the era in which our children will live .
In my grandparents ' time , it took several days to travel from Vitoria to Seville .
Now you can go from Vitoria to Copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane .
Today , at the end of the 20th century , a single market is operating in Europe in which we will soon be using a single currency .
We can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within Spain or even within the Basque Country .
We are building a vast European area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically .
This process may take a long time but it is unstoppable and , what is more , desirable .
The public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation .
In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process , someone said : " In the end , the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought : does it really matter whether we are Irish or British ?
Everyone can be what they want to be because , if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union , there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British .
What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function ? "
We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question . Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European ?
We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque , but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person .
If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis , as is already happening , and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating , why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish ? '
Fernando Buesa also said the following , which everyone in Ireland has probably thought . ' If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too .
What difference does it make to be Basque ? Surely it is all the same thing .
You can be what you want to be . If , in the future , economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena , there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish ' .

May he rest in peace .
( Loud applause )
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats , I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa , an elected representative of the Basque people , and Jorge Díez , a member of the Basque police force . We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party .
In recent times , in this House , we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe .
It does not matter what banner these come under because , in the end , they are all different expressions of the same thing .
Faced with these , we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead . On the contrary , we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill , and those who support and express understanding for the latter , from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom .
( Loud applause )
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament , Fernando Buesa , and his bodyguard , Jorge Díez .
In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union , it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended , provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice , freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based . The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable , as clearly indicated in the Treaties .
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez , particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people .
We pray that these are the last victims in a process which , as you said , Madam President , has seen much barbarism . We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace .
Madam President , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country . We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop .
The terrorist organisation ETA has , in its time , killed police officers and soldiers .
It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men , women and children .
In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general , Quintana Lacaci , who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981 .
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián , Gregorio Ordóñez .
It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law , Francisco Tomás y Valiente , and killed him in cold blood . Now , just a few days ago , in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco , it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament , Fernando Buesa , and his bodyguard , Jorge Díez , of the Basque police force .
ETA must be condemned . However , those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned .
There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road .
We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties , whether they are national or nationalist , and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are .
It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident .
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing .
It is time to share the Basque Country , Spain and Europe .
This , Madam President , is the only way forward which we therefore fully support .
Madam President , on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group , I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it .
For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy , but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy , in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others , democracy and democratic life .
So , Madam President , maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance .
Why does Parliament not meet in all the countries of the European Union and show that it rejects terrorism ?
Let us make ourselves heard !
We are not just confined to Brussels or Strasbourg .
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words , but a demonstration of our actual political commitment .
Madam President , as a member of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and also as an MEP for the Basque Nationalist Party , I must firstly categorically condemn the cowardly attack which took the lives of a Basque police officer , Jorge Díez Elorza , and the Basque MP and former vice-president , Fernando Buesa .
Secondly , we send our deepest condolences to their families , their socialist colleagues , the Basque parliament and the Basque police force . We also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy .
Thirdly , we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which , by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people , not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people .
Fourthly , we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country .
Fifthly , we again call on the Spanish and French leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the United Kingdom and Ireland in order to resolve the current Basque conflict with something more than police measures which , on their own , cannot bring about the peace which we all desire .
Sixthly and finally , we reaffirm that ETA ' s terrorism and violence must end . ETA must stop hijacking the will of the Basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion .
Just three months ago I took the floor in this House to congratulate the Irish and British people on their success in reaching the Northern Ireland settlement , as many other colleagues did .
In Northern Ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families shattered .
So far , unfortunately , in Spain and France , just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country .
We , Euskal Herritarrok , are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda .
Before 20 January last , during nineteen months , the only killing we witnessed in the Kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta , member of ETA , in March 1999 .
In spite of that and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police , including arrests of ETA negotiators with the Spanish government ' s agreement , ETA honoured its unilateral ceasefire .
Then , last November , before the ceasefire was over , the Spanish Government spokesman , Mr Piqué , declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the Basque country .
We , Euskal Herritarrok , have regretted many times the loss of human lives .
We share with all the Basque citizens the sufferings of our people .
We are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the Basque country .
Twenty years have passed since the Northern Ireland question was first raised in this Parliament .
May I ask : Quousque tandem - Noiz arte ?
Thank you , Mrs Dührkop Dührkop , I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect .
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .
Are there any comments ?
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall , Madam President , that at the beginning of the last session , I raised with you the question of whether , in the interests of openness and transparency , the Members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet .
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening .
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and , if so , whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so .
I can tell you , Mr Davies , that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members ' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve .
But we shall have a decision very soon .
( The Minutes were adopted )
Reforming the Commission
The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission .
I shall give the floor straight away to the President , Mr Romano Prodi .
- ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , last July , here in your presence , I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission .
I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July : the outgoing Commission had been in crisis , I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination .
The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission , to reform it thoroughly , completely revolutionising the Commission ' s way of working .
Today , that commitment has been fully discharged : you have the reform here , before you , in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission .
I would like to emphasise that , on that occasion too , the Commission voted unanimously , with one voice .
Briefly , these are the main points of the reform .
One : definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources .
This is at the heart of the system , and it is this , the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources , which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board .
In order to do this , we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism , a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these , to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control , which is of fundamental importance .
In this context , activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives , actions and resources .
The second point is human resources . It is the central part of our reform .
Our staff are the Commission ' s best asset , its richest resource . They are extremely highly qualified , of a calibre which it is difficult , if not impossible , to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used .
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission , and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work .
However , at the same time , I have found that morale amongst the Commission ' s staff is very low .
Previously , there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution , but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism .
All this has to change , and this is one of the main reasons for our reform .
Recruitment , career development , mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria : there will be greater emphasis on individual service , credible and , above all , verifiable performance appraisal systems , lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility .
These are the areas in which changes will be made .
The third point , which was also rather a sensitive , key issue in the recent crisis , is financial management .
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security .
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General .
At the moment , our control system is completely centralised ; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system .
This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice , decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain , that is of programmes , undertakings , contracts , expenditure and the related ex ante control systems , and an external auditing service which will direct these operations .
This is a complete revolution of the Commission ' s way of working ; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking .
We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage , and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff : we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place .
In fact , the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world .
We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology .
We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration .
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper , and so we are going to become a paperless Commission .
This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission .
This is not just a technical revolution , but a complete organisational revolution as well .
I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform , but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence , enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise .
We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff , who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission .
I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and , in my opinion , it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well .
The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff : they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become , once again , that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history .
The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever .
Now we can focus on the future , on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005 , the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks .
The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan .
We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission , a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions .
This is why we are redefining all our work priorities .
This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity .
For this reason , we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently .
We will make the best use of the resources at the Commission ' s disposal , but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them .
We may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future .
In September , we undertook to present a White Paper on reform , and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence .
The Commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve .
I would , however , remind you , and this is my final point , that the Commission is not the only Community institution .
Parliament and the Council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms .
The Commission has resolutely forged a path , and I hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end , in the service of the citizens of Europe , to achieve an ever-stronger and ever more transparent Europe .
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague , Michele Schreyer , to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning : " Reforming the Commission " .
As honourable Members will see from the document , which will be available to them today , the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission , with this Parliament and with the Council , which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January , have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements .
Together with Romano Prodi , I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses .
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context .
In the Commission , systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred .
The treaties have been revised , new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission , and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union , in our continent and in the world .
Those realities , together with the approach of further enlargements , all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission , so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development , of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness , maximum responsibility and maximum accountability .
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are , of course , basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised .
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too .
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind , and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere .
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance .
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide .
The House will be aware , of course , that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone .
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly .
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum .
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House .
Last month , as Romano Prodi has just said , we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September .
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years .
Inevitably , that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended .
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union .
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission .
And when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us .
If they are proven not to be , we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority .
If that does not meet with a positive response , the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed , not just by the Commission , but by this Parliament and by the Council too .
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities .
On the contrary , as many in this House understand , I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability .
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both .
In each of the three pillars of reform , the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital .
The new activity-based management system , that the President just mentioned , will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time .
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will , therefore , be vital .
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest .
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will , therefore , be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management .
In human resources policy , the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable .
Again , that will be a very demanding challenge .
And finally , in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors , the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change , the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance .
In the limited time available for this statement , it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals .
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years , and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon .
It is clear , of course , that in many ways the really hard work starts now , with the implementation of our proposals .
I look forward to working with this Parliament , with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples .
Thank you , Commissioner Kinnock .
We shall now move on to Question Time .
Madam President , the Commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials .
Recently , the immunity of a former Commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in Brussels on the basis that Brussels is the seat of the Community institutions .
Yet these institutions have other seats and , given that the Community ' s actions affect the whole Community territory , there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials , Commissioners and so on .
Is the Commission aware that , in order to lift immunity , it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding Commission officials accountable , including former and current Commissioners ?
There is effective legal precaution .
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind , not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner , but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted .
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member , but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted , and every single one of those requests has been met , and met with alacrity .
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded , but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information , or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission .
As the Parliament ' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report , Mr Kinnock , I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process , and if I may say to all colleagues here , we have a very important task to do , which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness .
And I make the point , before I move to my questions , that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because , of course , the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions .
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process .
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock , if I may .
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms .
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation , and clearly that is a major concern .
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside .
And if we are to move forward , I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side , early evidence of change of culture , empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later .
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations .
Indeed , it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced .
I suggest that is too long , and we really must move forward much more quickly than that .
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology .
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about , because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms .
On the second part of Mr Harbour ' s question , he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change , not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission , as the President briefly outlined in his statement .
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale , the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials , which is already very strong , will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training , the allocation of responsibility , the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing .
Cultures are products of structures and systems , and the structures and systems have become old .
By renovating those structures and systems , in some cases very radically , we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before .
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour .
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices .
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002 , but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect .
I do not use those as an excuse .
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms , these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously .
I would like everything to happen much more quickly . It is better to do it absolutely properly .
Madam President , we admire Mr Kinnock ' s vision and sense of realism .
For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is , at the same time , drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated .
Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities .
We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first .
I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities , because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise .
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context .
I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace , it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board .
We must resolutely switch from our present , rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace .
Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities ?
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House .
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out .
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities , not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have .
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective , smooth , calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union .
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect .
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism .
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised , I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement .
I hope that , in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament , not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way , but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union .
I do believe that reform with all it implies , including the new mechanisms , will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind .
I would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the Commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial White Paper with the accompanying action plan and I think when the President of the Commission described his Vice-President as acting with intelligence , enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure .
Two questions if I may .
We anticipate , if I understand correctly , a report in September on core activities .
Will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the Parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the Commission anticipates such a procedure ?
Secondly , on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures , do I understand correctly - and I have not had the opportunity to wade into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the Commission is indeed to empower the Directorates-General to liberate them from the ex ante visae system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system ?
If that is the case I can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own Group , I believe that if we have demanded in this House as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the Commission , its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers .
Let the managers manage .
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always , as he indicated , worthwhile .
So far as the September communication is concerned , it is unprecedented .
It will not be just one of the screenings that the Commission has periodically undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within Directorates-General and across the Commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands .
It is conceivable therefore - I cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which Parliament is engaged we may have to - I emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to Parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision .
That is a sensible forecast to make , it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain .
Can I thank Mr Cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the Committee of Independent Experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control .
I would emphasise , too , that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to " responsibilise " - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means .
In undertaking such a development in our organisation I am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations , both in the public sector and in the private sector , in the last decade or so .
I think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any relaxation of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks .
Financial control will be absolutely secured , both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes , and because we will introduce a completely professional , independent internal audit service .
As I said earlier , our ambition is total security for money and value for money .
We are also interested in value for the people who work for us .
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that .
I am also grateful , at the risk of being repetitive , to Mrs Theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which , if she will allow me to say so , she played midwife to many of the changes which we are now contemplating .
I hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part parentage .
First of all , I am not sure if I got the interpretation properly , but I do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as Mrs Theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control .
There is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current Financial Controller by the financial regulation .
However , because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control , and audit under the present terms , it is very difficult to think of this as an uncompromised role , no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it .
So , the changes that we seek to make - as I say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way at all .
Coherence , consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures .
One is to ensure high quality training , another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system , another is the establishment of a central financial service , as honourable Members will see from the White Paper , to ensure that those standards are set and supervised , and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service .
I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper , there are very strong assurances .
There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control , and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General .
If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control , the ex ante system can be used .
Naturally , there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage .
Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system , it most certainly can be used .
Lastly on transition , I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called " soft law " .
We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call " hard law " .
But , on this issue , I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council .
There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper .
In addition , however , and very importantly , because it is a transition period , there will be training , there will be advice , there will be support , there will be assurances . The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition .
Two other points I must make , because this is an essential question central to reform .
The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia .
Irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline .
I completely reject that simply because of the standards of Commission officials , the responsibility of directors-general and the assurances that we have built into the system .
Inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring .
Lastly , the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable .
Indeed the Court of Auditors has called it fiction .
Change will have to come in any case , change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one Friday to the next Monday from one system to another .
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have , I am certain that we have installed , or that we will install on the basis of our proposals , a system that will provide the Union , its taxpayers and this House with complete security .
Madam President , great importance has been attached to the reform process , which deserves to be acknowledged , although this may be somewhat premature .
My question is this : there is a need for reform , due not least to the accession of new countries , and thus to the enlargement of the Union .
How can we - the Commission , Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively , taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries ?
The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another .
How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament , the national parliaments and also the Commission , and the work they perform together , more effective ?
I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that , apart from its own inherent merits , reform will be made necessary by accession , the enlargements , and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in .
It is essential that we have that reform , both for the sake of the current Union , and certainly to facilitate accessions .
In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started , together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously , of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States .
We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering . I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities , the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market , it will be difficult to see the joins .
That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see .
All I can do now is to promise to strive for it .
Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David ' s Day .
Thank you for the presentation .
It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public .
That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time .
It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome , but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork .
Excessive paperwork .
Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control ?
That is a clear complaint that we get .
That needs to be addressed .
The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee .
This , of course , is welcome , but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure .
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work ?
Finally , the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged , as Mr Prodi says , by your actions , not your words .
The mission of reconnecting with the European public is critical as Mrs Morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words .
I say that with some deference in the European Parliament where there are so many experts in words , but we will try to lead by example .
As far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is spelt out by Mrs Morgan .
We detest the excess of paper , but given the requirements that we have to check and re-check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control , sometimes the requirements of administration , which some call bureaucracy , are unavoidable .
In order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum , we are not just talking about it ; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary-general , an additional deputy secretary-general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the Commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper , so much bureaucracy and I must say so much frustration , not only for the citizens and businesses of the Union but for the people who work for the Commission too .
We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent .
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform , the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe .
I know I can rely on everyone here .
That concludes Question Time .
I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock .
Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again , here in the European Parliament .
Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent .
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened .
This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas , particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred . However , I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me .
In recent months , since the last time I appeared before you , important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union . I would remind you of two of these events , one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament , and particularly to the President .
These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union .
The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds . There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip .
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency . A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal , in Vilamoura , with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America .
Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end , in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative , Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles , on his recent visit to the region .
However , I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki .
I will speak of this briefly . If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time , I will be pleased to answer them .
The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago .
Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent .
These were essentially of three types which I will describe .
The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management . The first is a political and security committee , the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union ' s relations with third countries and other organisations .
This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which , although geographically in Europe , are not part of the European Union , or at least not at the moment .
I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events .
Firstly , with regard to the decision-making bodies , the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning , 1 March 2000 . This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council .
Therefore , two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision , a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union .
I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch .
You can be satisfied with the progress made .
The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months .
Secondly , the Military Committee , which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries , will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration .
This Military Committee , as you can imagine , will have various duties .
In the interim stage , its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will , of course , try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next .
Thirdly , the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries . Together with myself , this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare , with the assistance of the Military Committee , any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union .
This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces .
Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics , not for military purposes , but with strictly humanitarian ends .
We are therefore working diligently in this respect . Madam President , if , a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time , I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today , that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use , many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad .
We are not mad . What we have done is to work long and hard , with determination and , without a shadow of a doubt , with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent .
Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination , drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki .
In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission .
I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time .
I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you . We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility .
Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis . I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace .
It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict , to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them . As you may recall , it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States .
It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days , or two months , to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year .
This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki . On Monday , just two days ago , in Sintra , a beautiful city very close to Lisbon , the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki .
The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us , including this House .
I will set this out in five points . Firstly , before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month , we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal , bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate .
To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace . We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well .
Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can , on this date , do its job and do it well .
Secondly , we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries .
Thirdly , we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide .
We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs .
How can we do this ?
This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States .
Madam President , the timetable must ensure that , by December of this year during the French presidency , the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match . We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available .
This is what we are doing and we are committed to this .
We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency , which is clearly carrying out excellent work , and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions .
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils , those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency .
On these four occasions , the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that , by the year 2003 , we are able to deploy what we have agreed , if necessary .
Madam President , we are therefore working on this issue with determination , energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government .
I have two further points to make on this process .
The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which , although geographically in Europe , are not members of the European Union .
We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises , which I hope will not be the case , all forces and all countries will be more than welcome .
Secondly , we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO .
The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types . The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO .
The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them , but using the means and infrastructure of NATO .
The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone .
In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent , positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO , as appropriate , which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves .
Madam President , I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide , the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months .
However , we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well .
As far as possible , we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans .
We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten .
On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well . There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that , after a few months , a police force is needed rather than a military force .
Then , in the final moments of the crisis , it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police . In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission .
I am not going to say much more on these issues .
Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention , such as in Kosovo , the Middle East and Chechnya .
There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you . However , I would prefer , Madam President , to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them .
However , before this happens , I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya .
Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny . When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good , as you can imagine .
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating . In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations .
In Grozny , there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat .
Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you .
Mr Gil-Robles told me that , when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night , the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities . The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well , if feasible .
These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment .
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and , in particular , better news from the Russian authorities .
Madam President , this brings me to the end of my speech . I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning .
I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission . This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations .
Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world .
Thank you very much indeed , Mr Solana .
I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering , on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
Thank you , Mr Poettering .
Mr Poettering , it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten ' s participation in this debate is most opportune , and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes .
Commissioner , would you like to speak now or a little later ?
( The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later ) Very well , thank you .
Madam President , Commissioner Patten , Mr Javier Solana , usted no es una persona loca , todo lo contrario ( you are not mad , quite the opposite ) .
We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit .
We know that you have an important role in this .
I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today , and in this context , and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question .
We cannot , of course , talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya .
My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group .
I want to concentrate on Kosovo .
It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means .
The KFOR forces have made , and are making , an invaluable contribution , but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term .
It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica .
They have now been replaced by robust Danish , Finnish and Swedish troops .
It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred , but it is important for the sake of Kosovo , the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail .
Through the Stability Pact , we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation .
This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union ' s common foreign and security policy .
At the moment , there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo .
Last autumn , we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force .
I am now delighted to hear that , this weekend , Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing .
I hope that this discussion will , in the first place , concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied .
When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo , I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament ' s and , as I understand it , also the Commission ' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo .
The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot , for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management , an idea which has already been translated into practical action .
Another , at least as important , lesson of our experience , however , is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently .
Therefore , the EU must also have an independent , credible conflict-prevention capacity .
On behalf of the Commission , Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction .
I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations , together with a Commission Crisis Centre .
My last question to Mr Solana is this : what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind ?
How have these been organised by Mr Solana ' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission ?
Mr President , Mr Solana , you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders .
I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian , peace-keeping and peace-making tasks .
But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe .
Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights .
I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament .
You must lay these concerns to rest for , as you yourself have said , when we are able to present a united transatlantic front , we are in a position to do something .
When we are divided , we are weakened , and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged .
So , maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway , Turkey and Canada , either .
You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers .
As George Robertson has said so often , we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo .
It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war .
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats .
Everything else is wishful thinking .
That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment . We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra .
The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny .
This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States .
No soldier can , of course , be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament .
It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army .
It will be a force comprised of various national units .
What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment .
However , there is , of course , also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament .
As someone who both speaks and listens , we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
Finally , I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion .
Yesterday , a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister .
He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much .
Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table .
We share your delight , as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired .
There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise : that the purpose of all this is , of course , that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all .
That is the purpose of all this , and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten , for it is military , economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries .
Mr President , Mr Solana , we are all behaving like children .
You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers .
It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004 , 2005 , 2006 .
But what about Kosovo in the year 2000 ?
You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles .
I have received an e-mail from a former colleague , Pierre Pradier , who is in Pristina at the moment .
He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina .
He treated Roma , Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo .
A man with three children and he was murdered .
We need policemen in Kosovo right now !
We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice .
I am not a warmonger , but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo , then what is the point in having soldiers at all ?
People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo , but that is the price of freedom at the moment .
If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue - border provocation , Serbian provocation , Albanian provocation , etc. we are heading for war .
Tell me , what civilian forces are being mobilised , Mr Patten ?
We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening , and to tell the military and the police what they must do , otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence .
( Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez ) We have a major problem , because we are providing travel warrants for the people , but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis , as in Chechnya .
Mr Poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so .
He is not always right , but in this case he is .
I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria , but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia .
I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are German and from my party , whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party !
In the current situation , we should say to the Russians " If you want money , if you want us to reduce your debts , you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia " .
If not , we are not prepared to pay for their war , since , by reducing the debt , by giving them money , we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres .
We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers .
It is not enough just to say , " You , the murderers , please stop the slaughter ! "
They know full well that they should not commit these acts .
Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good ?
But that is his strategy , he instigated this war .
From the beginning , he wanted this war in order to become president .
So that is the world as it is today .
For that reason I say to you : my Group is not entirely in agreement , but I am in favour of European defence .
I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments .
First of all , the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers .
If a civilian task force can , at the same time , intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step , we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers , but who are incapable of sending in civilians .
As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements , we shall not be credible .
Mr President , Mr Solana , we are very uneasy about replying to you because , in our view , you are responsible for an area that does not really exist .
We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or , and this is possibly more serious , that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics .
In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of , at Sintra , the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is ' pretentiously ' called autonomous .
Now , the Union can certainly call the body an ' action force ' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering - on paper - of men , weapons and logistics . But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether .
What interests will this so-called force defend , in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests ?
Let us just consider for a moment .
What is the basis of armed action ?
It is the defence of a territory , the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital ?
Just what is an army in the absence of a home country , in the absence of territory - because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests , which the Fifteen have , for good reason , never dared to discuss .
In short , what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy ?
We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights , a kind of army in the service of vague ideas , of an ideal , the dangers of which have many times been shown in history .
A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one ' s own interests .
But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system .
Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin , escorted by their respective henchmen , and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington , seeing themselves at best as bit-part players .
Mr Solana , you yourself are a perfect illustration of this , as it were , structural complicity , passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same .
Of course , in reality , they are the same thing .
It is still the old imperial service . It is not without some amusement that we have seen you , in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten , present this delightful and most charming argument : one day you told a German newspaper , " I am the one that the Americans phone up " .
You might have added , Mr Solana , ' to give me their instructions ' , because that is what we see , in fact .
In the case of the Balkans , just like everywhere else , one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it .
Yes , Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you , Daniel Cohn-Bendit . In every case , it is follow-my-leader syndrome .
Do you think I am going over the top ?
Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience .
Echelon is one of many examples of this , giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here .
The experts speak of a cultural problem , I think they might be right !
On behalf of the combined European right , I must say to you , Mr Solana , as High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy , we do not have confidence in you .
You say that you are against war , but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war .
A war of aggression , slavishly carrying out American military policy , in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty , against a state that had never been a member , that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war .
Today , even Mr Cohn-Bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for .
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern , that is the least one can say .
First of all , in your view , does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union , as one might think , or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world ?
Secondly , if you do recognise this right , then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on ?
I can already hear your reply : humanitarian standards .
In Kosovo , it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia .
When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama , it was not to impose their politics , it was to combat drug trafficking .
When they landed in Somalia , before having to withdraw in disarray , it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route , it was to restore hope .
' Restore hope ' , do you remember ?
In a nutshell , can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons .
Finally , you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management .
Not to make war , of course , but to protect peace .
But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions .
Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention , particularly those which , in their elections , do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union ?
Mr Solana , these questions convey our concern .
You say that you are against war , but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that .
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward .
Mr President , it goes without saying that the development of a European security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined NATO last year : Poland , the Czech Republic and Hungary .
As candidate countries of the European Union , they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning , that is to say as of now .
This request , however , was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year .
In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation .
This is why I would like to ask the High Representative , Mr Solana , to what extent Prague , Warsaw and Budapest are , or will be , involved in European military crisis management plans .
Given Poland ' s rather critical stance , this question is all the more pressing .
Its reservation is captured in the following , rather blunt wording : avoid American isolationism and European separatism .
As one might expect , the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister , Mr Bronislaw Geremek , has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms : " The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO ' s unity .
If anything , the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO " .
We all very much share this opinion .
Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today .
The Czech Defence Minister , for example , shares this opinion .
In the autumn of last year , the latter stated : " Security within Europe is not divisible .
It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries , with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions " .
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana .
Poles only need five words for this : nothing about us without us !
What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries ?
Mr President , I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members ' questions this time round . On his first appearance in November this was not possible , although this was not Mr Solana ' s fault .
It should be acknowledged , however , that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members .
We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective , visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union .
In this respect , I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian , diplomatic , humanitarian and police elements , to which Mr Solana referred .
The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies .
In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy .
One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about .
This meeting was based on two documents , one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union .
Mr Solana , would you be prepared , at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit ?
I should like to ask Mr Patten and , through you , the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question .
Secondly , to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7 % of GDP to defence expenditure ?
I would like to hear your opinion . Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect ?
Thirdly , what assessment would you make of the ' Crisex 2000 ' exercises which have just ended in which , for the first time , the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ?

Fourthly and finally , if the Member States asked for this , would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee ? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers , High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy , Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO .
Mr Solana , as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , I shall limit my speech to those subjects .
You have , Mr Solana , heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo , Chechnya and elsewhere .
For my part , I do not wish to give up hope .
And today , as far as you are concerned , I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed .
Indeed , we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective , in any case , the objective that I wish to achieve .
But I do give you credit for your intense work , the number of meetings held , your efforts to create a rapid intervention force , your specific efforts to prevent crises , to manage them or stop them through civilian means and , if necessary , by military means .
I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the " what is to be done " variety .
The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December , without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon .
What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings ?
And finally , what do you most need at these next summits ?
My second question is different , although it is not unconnected with the previous one .
It concerns the next IGC .
Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties , if it appeared that , as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment , they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established ?
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February .
Can you tell us your position on this subject ?
Mr President , Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe .
At long last , the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative .
The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent .
However , if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times , the Treaty must include a flexibility clause .
Mr Solana can play an important role in this .
He is not stupid .
Certainly not !
He is a driven man , a competent man .
But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence .
In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council , Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU , as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit .
One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep , Mr President .
From a democratic point of view , I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable .
This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is , of course , not a democratically elected politician , but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament .
His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten , as has been illustrated again today , in fact .
It appears that , as European security and defence policy takes shape , the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold .
This too is unacceptable in my view .
Naturally , every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient , but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power .
Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself .
Mr President , peace is the European Union ' s very raison d ' être .
I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly .
We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy , cultural diversity and tolerance .
But look at us now ! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness , and regard the wars in Africa with indifference , despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries , given that they are ex-colonies .
Some of them are our ACP partners .
The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment .
In Kosovo , we stepped in with military means , having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia .
We are now unable to guide the peace .
This is why Europe is not credible as a Union .
I do not believe , Mr Solana , that we can restore this credibility by military means .
As representatives from the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries , but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us .
We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term .
This is not because we are against European defence , but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound , democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs .
At the moment , Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of .
I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level .
In my opinion , it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment , which are such nice toys , after all .
I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration , underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside .
Because our borders do not stop at the Mediterranean Sea .
Mr President , allow me to start with the conquest of Kosovo .
It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing , not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia , to change the borders and to promote the New Order .
Today , we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities .
All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica , the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo , the promotion of the independence of Kosovo , the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece , despite the objections of the Greek people and , at the same time , intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia .
On the other hand , despite his declarations on humanity and peace , it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that , according to the Helsinki resolutions , we intend to set up a terrorist army , starting with 60 000 men , in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet .
Mr Solana has confirmed our view that , in a militarised European Union , NATO will have the upper hand .
That is why this job went to Mr Solana , the Secretary-General of NATO , who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia ; the right man for the right job , against whom charges have been filed , calling for him to be tried as a war criminal .
Commissioner , Mr Solana , there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas .
I wonder , and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members , about the direction in which we are going .
I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union , which was an integrated process within the Community structures , today , unfortunately , the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure .
My first question , Mr Solana and Commissioner , is to establish whether , together , you have framed strategies that will , at least gradually , lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process .
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union .
We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy , but the process must be clear .
I also believe that we should not underestimate , and this is a question that I put to you , the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries .
We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community .
Today , they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy , and I believe that they are working with that in mind .
Finally , with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo .
Without this status , there will only be instability , murders , provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter .
Finally , I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives , as we say in common parlance , are getting a bit much .
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice , for example .
Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates , we have still not had a trial , and we still do not know what is happening .
As far as tourism is concerned , there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium , for example .

So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him , which is what I hope will happen .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March , for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy .
But I do wonder what his own view is on this .
According to the documents , cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful .
You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch . You have to admit , it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks .
But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light ?
I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent .
Over the past couple of months , High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have , during discussions , among other things , with members of the NATO Assembly , tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO .
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course .
The Treaties also point in that direction , although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar .
We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar .
Actually , I hear less and less about this .
I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks , with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs , which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed , about which he has talked with enthusiasm , and rightly so , and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment .
It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation , which would work very well .
But is there not more to it than that ?
I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy , NATO ' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence .
The European pillar does not really function any more as such . Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks .
Is this actually how we want things done ?
Moreover , whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union , there is no longer any mention of Article V , which is , of course , of direct concern to us .
Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg .
Will it be omitted ?
At the same time , an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets .
I think that this is to be welcomed , but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider , collective defence tasks .
I wonder how this will develop .
I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future .
Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling ?
I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy .
I do wonder , if Turkey were to bring in a brigade , would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy ?
The fabric of Turkey ' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities .
That would seem odd to me .
Secondly , the Baltic States are also knocking on our door .
Will they also take part in our defence policy ?
It is a very interesting position to be in , to say the least .
High Representative , you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki , such as the establishment of the three committees and , of course , the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force .
However , this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further .
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who , rightly , are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference .
A word of warning to the latter : this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation .
We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy , and I would therefore ask you , in general terms , of course , whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues : the new , two-level Commission-High Representative structure ; a clear , practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management .
At this stage , this could include , for example , collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee , the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management , the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence , coordination of the Treaty on European Union , the NATO Charter and the WEU , the legal personality of the European Union , reinforced cooperation in this area as well , parliamentary control and , lastly , financing .
Do you think that any of these issues could be included , at least in the agenda of the current Conference ?
Mr Solana , I am sitting quite close to you , close enough to see your face .
I think that you have aged , your face is quite lined .
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you ; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers , as Mrs Maes just put it , and what you do not say .
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here , while blood is being spilled in Kosovo , and you have not said a word about it .
You are Spanish ; you are from a large country , Mr Solana .
Spain and Franco were not one and the same .
Spain maintained its unity , it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so , because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain ' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator .
Today , you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina , with Montenegro and with southern Serbia . It is you who has created this mess .
Which is why , unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees , all these plans on paper will lead to new blood-letting in the Balkans .
Mr Solana , the war in Kosovo and the continuing crisis , have served to reveal a European public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the European Union , throughout the world , should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America and that the time has come to share the burden , which our American friends have constantly been demanding since Europe became a world economic power .
Over the last year , the Member States of the Union have , naturally , decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra , held the day before yesterday in your presence , has just confirmed the main trends .
I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work .
The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men , which , as you have said , is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis , if necessary .
For the information of our colleagues , I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts : one third to prepare the mission , one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation , following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment .
This explains why the initial figures given in the press , setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men , is close to reality , which has certainly surprised the uninitiated .
My first question , Mr Solana , will be simple and more direct , perhaps , than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me .
You know the French proverb , ' Nothing for nothing ' .
Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them , apparently at least , have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends .
My second question is of a more technical nature , but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible .
You have told us , in this regard , that three committees are being set up , a political committee and a security committee , which started up today , and a military committee .
You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union .
In the operation of the temporary institutions , whose establishment has just been decided , can you tell us , Mr Solana , what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which , I repeat , are not yet members of the European Union ?
Could they , for example , have a place , at least as observers , in the different political and security committees or in the military committee ?
You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion .
Mr President , Secretary-General , as you can tell , the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence .
Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles .
However , in terms of foreign policy , I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements , as some Members have said this afternoon , without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against . I will give you an example .
During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East , which you mentioned , the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region .
Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who , like us , hope to mediate between two opposing parties ?
This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt .
In this respect , as you will know , the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community . This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination .
Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative , without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee ?
Mr Solana , it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure .
Of course it is , but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful .
In any case , it is prevention that I would like to discuss today .
War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf .
As you know , the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284 , and this is likely to lead , within the next six or seven weeks , to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
If this happens , the United States ' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention .
A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures , particularly Mr Tarek Aziz , convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284 .
However , the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that , once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed , the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed .
I would like to know what you and Europe are doing , Mr Solana , or what you intend to do in the near future , to stave off this threat of war .
Today , we have the chance to prevent it ; tomorrow it may be too late .
I would also like to know whether , in this context , it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis , or to set them free if this is within their power .
As we sit here , hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique .
This has not just happened .
The flooding has been going for weeks , and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need .
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic .
For a long time , many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures , when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments , particularly for humanitarian intervention .
I acknowledge Mr Patten ' s efforts in this direction , but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO .
Of course , there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance , and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries .
These are of long standing , but are being addressed already within NATO .
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous , decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO .
After all , the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table .
NATO is largely European .
Finally , Mr Solana , I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe .
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , with regard to the war in Chechnya , we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular .
Now , what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide .
How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants , the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns , villages and districts where , in amongst the whole of the civilian population , there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters ?
How should we describe the sinister filtration camps , which are comparable to concentration camps , in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive ?
How can we describe the rapes , the looting , the deliberate fires , the deportations , which are called " cleansing " , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe ?
And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres ?
If that is realpolitik , if we really do not have any means , Mr Solana , as High Representative of the CFSP , and Commissioner , I put this question to you both , let us at least use the means that we do have , namely , the aid programmes to Russia .
The war in Chechnya proves , if proof were necessary , that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers .
Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war , to the exclusion of any other objective .
Mr High Representative , you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at Helsinki .
Some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a distinctly European security organisation to defend peace in the world .
Of course we recognise the role of the Security Council , as the Helsinki resolutions clearly state , in maintaining international peace and security .
However , we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the Security Council , as referred to at Helsinki , was contested recently .
The point is : does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism , which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg decisions ?
What about the infrastructures ?
Is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy ?
Secondly , what will happen to the European defence industry which , after all , comes under the more general activities relating to this system ?
Will current programmes continue to be implemented ?
Finally , if the Treaty needs to be amended , how do you think this amendment will be implemented , following the report to be submitted in Feira ? How will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the Treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting ?
Has any thought been given to the matter ?
Has it been discussed ?
And to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant Commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the Commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient ?
Mr President , I seem to recall from my study of European history , that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job .
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement .
That said , I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far .
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters , and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity , rather than nicely formulated institutions .
And , to that end , I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation , or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity , particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security .
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels .
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure , because some Member States spend considerably more than others .
And indeed , some Member States are not geared for mobility .
They are very static in their military forces , and unsuitable for this sort of warfare .
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask , in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing , to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies , particularly in development , because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right .
And finally , can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development .
We cannot leave it simply to governments .
I strongly support the decisions taken at Sintra .
They constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective European Security and Defence Policy .
The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction .
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate .
However , while all these developments are indeed welcome , I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions .
I am anxious to know how effective the EU ' s policy planning and early warning unit has been .
While Commissioner Patten ' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune , I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information .
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit , which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members , assisted in providing early information , analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves ?
I would also like to support Mr Titley ' s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area .
If we are to realise our ambitions in the field of foreign policy , then effective anticipation and preparation for all sorts of crises , particularly humanitarian ones , are essential prerequisites .
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention ; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention , but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way .
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year , but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with .
What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations .
We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya .
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya .
We have large gaps in what we are arguing for , in principle , in relation to human rights .
We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo , and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention .
So , I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya .
What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ?
We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them , but we are choosing not to use them .
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , I have two questions for you , Mr Solana .
How , with credibility , are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments ?
Meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .
I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper .
If we look around , the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk .
Take , for example , Germany ' s defence savings .
These are not only of concern to the defence minister , Mr Scharping . Instead , they also affect the whole of Europe .
In my own country , Sweden , the objective , and the commitment towards playing our part , is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations .
In the present situation , the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men , due to reduced defence spending .
If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole , which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place , we shall not have 60 000 men but , at best , 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003 .
My second question concerns the following matter . Some weeks ago , you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media , whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters .
I should like , however , to know the background to this , namely whether , as High Representative , you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and , if so , on whose mandate and with how much leeway .
I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative .
I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin , which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament , by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality .
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow .
I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject .
I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament .
Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe ' s ambitions in the area of CFSP .
This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well .
As I said in my remarks , I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative ' s remarks today were extremely encouraging .
We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time , but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves , for example , facing up to difficult questions about resources .
Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough , about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union .
I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy , of conflict prevention and crisis management .
Rightly , the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that .
We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required , not in months or years , but in days or weeks .
We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative ' s policy unit .
Additionally , and this is for me the most important area of all , an area where we are breaking new ground , we will , soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility , be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals .
It is , I repeat , breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo , policing elsewhere , is the most dramatic and obvious example . It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner .
I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green .
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job , and writing a very good report , just to respond to my honourable friend , on policing in part of my own country .
I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying ' What in your view is the ideal community police officer ' and the reply was ' a black grandmother ' .
But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo .
We have armed forces , we have all got experience of training community police officers .
What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing .
We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well .
That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences .
So again , rhetoric and reality .
Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate .
One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject .
But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon .
I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights , between neglecting habeas corpus , between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance , between tyranny and between environmental degradation .
All those things come together .
We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well .
So , in the coming months , we will be producing communications from the Commission , for example , which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises .
We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about , that is , how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it .
We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines , actually the use of sensor equipment .
The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique .
They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells , they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools .
What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days , moving those anti-personnel mines around ?
We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise .
What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere .
We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine , in Moldova , the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks , the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks , the political consequences of dealing with those stocks .
So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related .
We have all the instruments , we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years .
Now , I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric .
We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them - Bosnia , Albania , Kosovo .
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics , quite a few American politicians , quite a few senators and congressmen who say ' How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep ? ' .
So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans . I hope that all those heads of government , all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans , who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans .
I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council , the General Affairs Council and Ecofin .
All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver .
In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America , I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement , we will be there to pay for it .
I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses .
I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia
Where is the beef ?
And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy .
That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view .
One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality , the response is ' Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently , we know that you have not spent all your commitments , we know there is some money in your back pocket ' .
I want us to be in a position in which we can say : ' It is not like that any more .
We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can ' .
So , Member States , we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions , between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Patten .
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue , for it makes things a little more interesting .
Women in the decision-making process
The next item is the declarations by the Council and the Commission on women in the decision-making process .
Mr President , two centuries ago , during the French Revolution , a very famous woman , Olympe de Gouges , was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women .
Two centuries later , we have achieved a great deal in Europe .
The last century was marked by three periods .
The first period was a period of institutional change , change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women ' s movement , as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women .
This was followed by a second period , in which the worth of female models was recognised .
There were women everywhere .
Prime ministers , members of parliament , ministers , in the professional arena , doctors , lawyers , pilots , generals .
We are now in a third period : in this third period , the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed .
The composition , or rather the change in composition , will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes .
Ladies and gentlemen , the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events : the first was the election of the President of Finland , Mrs Halïnen .
For the first time in Finland , the women candidates outnumbered the men .
And a woman was elected .
The second event took place in France , which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the ' Women and Men in Power ' conference , at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio .
We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner .
A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States .
But the figures tell the true story .
And the figures still give Europe cause for concern .
24 % of members of government are women and there are an average of 22 % in parliament , although this fluctuates from 6 % in some Member States to as many as 40 % in others .
The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small .
Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium , which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes , the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18 % .
What we need , therefore , is to promote specific policies .
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments , as in Sweden and Finland ; they now have governments in which women account for 56 % and 44 % of members respectively .
We need organisation and statistical monitoring .
We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture , mentality and specific problems of each area .
And , of course , these policies need a budget , they need to be given financial teeth .
Increasing the number of women or , as the French prime minister put it , increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres , is the best way of renewing the policy , of reshaping the approach to the question , of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience : the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up .
The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important .
These indicators include national parliaments , regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State .
I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets , compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool .
The programme which I shall present for the fifth women ' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring .
Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned , the same cannot be said for the private sector .
My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light .
There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers , sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2 % of the directors and managers are women .
Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres .
Here too , specific efforts will be made of course ; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature , but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices ; in all cases , my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results .
As you know , Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within .
A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40 % for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes .
It was approved by the House in May 1999 , when the need for women in research and technology was stressed .
We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together , as can be seen from the reform of the Commission , to achieve 40 % representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission .
Ladies and gentlemen , there are often objections , crypto-progressive objections , as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power .
No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say .
And at the level of the European Union , the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked .
Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population .
I should like to be absolutely categorical .
There should be no reservation , no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power .
( Applause )
Women make up half the population , half the strength of the planet .
Excluding women from the centres of power means , first , democratic failure and , secondly , under-exploitation of human resources .
We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles .
I am optimistic that we shall succeed .
The bet before us is a bet with time .
Future generations of women must not be sidelined .
If need be , we must use all possible means to force the situation .
( Applause )
Mr President , firstly I must thank Mrs Belém Roseira for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject .
I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words .
The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process , in both the political and the economic and social spheres .
Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life , in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved .
The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work . This involves both equality in accessing work , which implies equality in training , and equal pay for the same work , so often defended and yet far from being achieved .
We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole .
Women always have a different viewpoint from men . This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us , who are dedicated to active politics , undertake to solve .
The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making .
In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women .
However , this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men .
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent .
The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women .
There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women , who are ready and able , to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process .
There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system .
Some Members have even come out against this .
Personally , I would not want to feel like a quota , to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman .
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference .
Mr President , I should also like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for good speeches on their part which I think provide hope for real optimism , especially given the will and commitment radiated by both women .
I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women .
It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear , what we are concerned with here .
I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission - but then , of course , she is young and full of energy .
I am convinced that it will be hard work , when all is said and done .
If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament , she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality .
I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power .
That is absolutely crucial .
It should also be remembered , however , that no one voluntarily relinquishes power , and that applies to both men and women .
Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them , but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power , and I am thinking here , in particular , of positions of power in relation to children .
Moreover , I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today .
Inevitably , we should like , for the same reasons of power politics , to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves .
What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides ' surrendering power .
The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix , and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden .
Just for the record , I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark .
And I say that , of course , because I come from Denmark .
In fact , 45 % of the Danish government is made up of women , and that is , in reality , a touch more than in Finland .
We still do not have a female president but , on the other hand , we have a queen , and that must no doubt , in certain contexts , amount to the same thing .
I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned , notably the question of financial resources .
It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term .
In the short term , we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and , of course , also properly educated .
The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures .
One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing , and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit , which is , of course , to be partly concerned with IT developments .
I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women , specifically because it is characterised by flat , rather than hierarchical , structures .
In Denmark , we have , in any case , seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up .
There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally .
The first is the issue of the media ' s influence .
I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish .
Do we have a special problem in this regard ?
I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question .
I have a suspicion that this is the case , but I am not certain .
The second point is the enlargement of the Union .
I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well , specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned .
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner ' s statement ; it is time that fine words were translated into action .
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves .
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems .
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this .
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process .
In the meantime , we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures .
We can learn from the successes mentioned , not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected , but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system .
I am pleased to say that in Wales , which I represent , 40 % of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but , on the other hand , we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10 % of the total ; so statements of principle , of support in principle , are not enough because they have not worked .
If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen .
Mr President , at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910 , it was decided that the main demand of the time , that of a woman ' s right to vote , should be linked to the women ' s question as a whole and that ( as also stated in the relevant resolution ) Women ' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for .
It is also worth noting that International Women ' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years .
In 1910 , a woman ' s right to vote was on the agenda .
Today , we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process .
Women are no homogenous collective .
Women belong to different social classes .
Women have different individual needs and interests .
Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class , race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work , it is nonetheless a fact that , in all areas of society , the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men ( albeit with a few individual exceptions , it is perhaps best to add ) .
In my own country , Sweden , a number of political parties have , in recent years , voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run .
This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which , in turn , has provided opportunities for further research .
What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making ?
What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes , so too of course do the types of decisions made .
When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender , the word " qualifications " also crops up .
What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined .
It often looks as if men today , as in the past , always have the least defined qualifications .
Being a man therefore seems , in itself , to be synonymous with maximum competence .
This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today ' s decision makers .
Earlier this year , we requested , here in this Chamber , that 8 March be made into an international holiday .
In anticipation of this request being met , I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the " Women ' s World Marches " which are to begin this spring on International Women ' s Day .
This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world .
Finally , I want to say , as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close , that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother .
We do not have any such officers , but black grandmothers are in fact to be found .
Mr President , the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness .
Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics .
It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible .
In France , 95 % of elected representatives are town councillors .
The vast majority of them are not members of any party .
In the authorities of the French departments , the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives , in right-wing or left-wing categories .
In order to be elected as a local councillor , you just have to want to be elected .
But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates .
Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union .
That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination , whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities .
The policy of minorities , while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family , to establish superficial divisions , is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system .
On the one hand , if we establish quotas for women , why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group , quotas of Catholics , of workers , of those who wear glasses .
The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women .
With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions .
It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation .
The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs .
On the other hand , such a policy shows a deep contempt for women .
A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised .
Ladies , have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota ?
Women deserve more than a quota .
It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality .
I would like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their speeches and for committing themselves before the European Parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today .
The presence of women in decision-making bodies , in particular , is a question of democracy .
All citizens , both men and women , should be able to see , to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule .
If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies , it is clear that we are still far from true democracy .
However , it is also a question of political agendas .
In addition to making up the majority of the population , women are also the most dynamic element in society : it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years ; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men , and in many of our regions , they are the main feature of the innovation , training , performance and flexibility development model .
Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan , where I live , 90 % said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day .
Women work an average of 60 hours a week , which is 20 hours longer than men .
The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time .
If this is true , and it is , any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point .
Laws , programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed , coordinated and audacious , in order to encourage the formation of new cultural , economic , social , institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women .
Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe , but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation .
I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere - the entire European political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing , and for decisive action to be taken in this matter .
Mr President , before I came here for today ' s sitting , I was watching Finnish television .
In Finland , an honorary company of the Finnish army was saluting the new President of the Republic , with the words " Good morning , Madam President . "
You perhaps know that , in Finland , the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader , but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces , so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion .
During the Finnish presidential term , a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision-making process , and , on the basis of this report , I hope that the Commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making .
I urge you all , women of the Right , to listen to Mrs Lulling , because she told us why quotas were needed and , if any of us has sufficient experience of political life , it is she .
Finally , I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference .
I appeal to you , ladies and gentlemen , not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4 , to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , despite the progress made in terms of legislation and despite the complaints that we all utter from time to time on the subject of sexual inequality and sexual discrimination , the causes of these practices are still present in the amendments that have been tabled to this resolution . This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process .
We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve , both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility .
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy .
It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council , the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made , particularly at the Beijing Conference .
Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I am a right-wing Member of Parliament but I have the same battles as my colleagues in supporting and assisting fellow citizens in my country to gain power and access to decision-making posts , which should be feasible not only in the political arena but clearly also in all sectors of society .
Quite simply , I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas , because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved .
It is quite logical , it is consistent !
It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50 % , if not more , of those within decision-making bodies and , inter alia , in the political arena .
So , there should be no positive discrimination to include women .
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense .
When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics , I want to say - no , definitely not .
Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training ?
That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority .
But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men , particularly in politics .
So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power , to gain responsible posts in the political arena , but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think .
We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women ' s participation in the political decision-making process .
Mr President , Minister , Commissioner , " Women are half of heaven " , a successful man once said .
But when it comes to important decisions and priorities , there is a lack of women ' s voices .
Women , who constitute more than half of the population , are heavily under-represented within political , economic and social fields .
That is unacceptable in a democracy .
Where equality is concerned , the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making .
If we are to achieve a balance , a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required .
An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women ' s full participation in power structures and decision making .
I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind .
I propose that the EU ' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area , with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated .
Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape , sexual offences , domestic violence and the trade in women , but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes .
The latter are consequently accorded low priority , and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted .
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts , conflict resolution and reconstruction work .
In the resolution , we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping .
The call for women ' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy ; it is also essential if women ' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full .
Not to use women ' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste .
Women should not only be " half of heaven " but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today .
We have high hopes for what you will achieve .
We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions .
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large , we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women , and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today .
Furthermore , we want values that women consider important , such as peace , fraternity , equality , justice , security and environmental protection , to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and , if possible , throughout the world .
In order to achieve this , women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has , until now , been essentially imbued with masculine values .
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for .
Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory : not over men , not over anyone , but the victory of equality between men and women .
We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities , and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now , and particularly women , concerns the new economy and the new information technologies .
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women .
The rate of employment in Europe , which is much lower than in the United States and Japan , must be increased .
We must therefore have many more women in work , and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall .
I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women .
Mr President , Commissioner , the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success , such as , for example , in Finland , France and Sweden , and equally , you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well , such as , for example , my own country and Greece too , which you forgot to mention .
Moreover , I have heard that for the next elections , it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece .
I think this is a very sad state of affairs .
I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda .
This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution .
I myself , Commissioner , am a product of quotas .
I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result .
It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance .
It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas , and you yourself made reference to Belgium , Commissioner , where it has not really taken off .
Hardly surprising , would you not agree , Mrs Avilés Perea , not because we failed to find the necessary candidates , but because recent scientific research , instigated by the Commission , has shown that quotas are , in fact , only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats .
This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas .
Indeed , Minister , we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract .
But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this .
The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system , as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis .
I would suggest the following : where possible , apply it on a voluntary basis , where there is reluctance , impose it .
I hope that in the fifth action programme , Minister and Commissioner , benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through , for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this .
Mr President , I too should like to congratulate the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their solid recommendations and , above all , for their proposals .
Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women ' s rights , I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual , Francis Fukuyama , to today ' s debate .
In an article entitled " If women ruled the world " , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics , the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence .
Athena , the goddess of wisdom and war , may have been a female model in Ancient Greece , but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace .
There are , therefore , serious grounds , over and above justice between the sexes , for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women .
Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue , reconciliation , an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means .
These female virtues can offer an alternative to today ' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone .
That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community .
Mr President , why do women need their rightful share in political decision making ?
And how should we achieve this ?
We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary .
It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and , as such , a condition for political legitimacy .
But if we look into how to achieve this , the opinions are greatly divided .
Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment , much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties ?
And is it then up to the state , in other words the legislative , to impose such measures on political parties ?
Or should we even consider a system in which 50 % of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies ?
This discussion , which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of parité , touches the very core of democracy , and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman .
In my opinion , the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level .
I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists , without which , in fact , I would not be here today .
Like Mrs Van Lancker , I am a product of such a measure .
In my opinion , though , the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties , at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself .
In other words , the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid .
We would , in this way , violate democracy .
Mr President , today ' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision-making bodies and changes to the decision-making system in Europe .
We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors , education , work , culture .
The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres .
The debate is a deeply political one .
There are two approaches .
The first is a policy of persuasion .
Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved .
Three comments : the first is based on the fact that women are able .
I can , therefore all women can .
How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded ?
We are able but the rest of the female population is not ?
Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics .
Because women have to deal with different realities .
Because they have fewer opportunities .
Because they have a different level of education .
Because they have to face social obstacles .
Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest .
The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders .
Not necessary !
They have all been persuaded !
There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women .
There is not one party , from the far left to the far right , which does not stress the need for women to take part .
On paper !
Thirdly , we must expect things to change gradually .
The women ' s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light .
With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level , it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women .
As far as Europe is concerned , as far as the European Parliament is concerned , where there is a quota for the involvement of women , it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation .
The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women .
Quotas alone are not enough .
If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history .
On this we are clear .
Quotas are one of the ways , one of the policies needed to bring about change .
Finally , on the question of whether , as the product of quotas , we can be proud , I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece , where the level of representation of women is 5 % .
Thank you , Mrs Diamantopoulou .
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow morning .
Floods in Mozambique
The next item is the Commission statement on flooding in Mozambique .
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission .
The Commission is following with very great concern , as I know all honourable Members will be , the emergency situation in Mozambique .
The continuing torrential rains throughout the southern African region aggravated by the Cyclone Eline have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure .
About 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods , about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance .
Several people have lost their lives , many have disappeared , many have been injured .
The government of Mozambique has appealed for humanitarian aid from third countries .
The international community including the United States of America , Switzerland , South Africa , Ireland , Norway , Denmark , Italy , Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance .
My colleague Poul Nielson is literally on his way to Mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the Portuguese Secretary of State to assess the situation on the ground .
Mr Nielson will be happy to report back to Parliament on the findings of his mission .
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far , perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks .
First of all , from 1986 to 1989 , I was an overseas development minister and I formed a particular attachment to the people of Mozambique .
They were bravely dealing then with huge environmental and political problems , with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war .
If ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was Mozambique .
Secondly , that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which Mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society .
Thirdly , we spent much of this afternoon in this Chamber discussing conflict prevention , how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively .
We talked about the importance of the Commission developing a series of headline goals for non-military actions related to crises and , if I may say so , if ever there was a case where that is relevant , it is the disaster which has overwhelmed Mozambique .
Let me turn to the assistance provided so far .
Last week ECHO decided to allocate EUR 1 million for flood relief , of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150 000 through MSF Luxembourg , for operations in Mozambique and EUR 250 000 to Botswana through the German Red Cross .
These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care , water and sanitation .
ECHO is currently preparing a second decision for a further EUR 2 million This decision will be implemented through UNICEF , Action Contre La Faim , COSV , Nuova Frontera and Vireaid pending , of course , the reception and examination of their final proposals .
These NGOs will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation , provision of shelter , plastic sheeting , jerry cans , blankets , those sorts of things .
They will be concentrating on the reinstallation of displaced people , on the further prevention of outbreaks of malaria , cholera and other communicable diseases , on the provision of supplementary food to malnourished and children at risk , on the provision of seeds and tools , on food security , on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters .
A third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of Commissioner Nielson .
The Commission is also preparing a medium-term Community response combining NGO co-financing with European Development Fund operations to help Mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re-establishing the rapid pace of growth that Mozambique had worked so hard to achieve .
It is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re-construction within a three to four years time horizon .
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent .
I am not sure that I can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity .
I repeat , Commissioner Nielson will be happy to report to Parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mozambique is a young African country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy .
The credit for Mozambique ' s success story must be shared equally by its government , by the opposition , but above all , by the people of Mozambique .
There is a risk , however , that all the effort that has been made in recent years , after all the problems with the peace agreements , with which we are all familiar , will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on Mozambique over the last few weeks .
The current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying , as the Commissioner has already said : around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees , waiting for a helicopter to come and save them . There have already been hundreds of deaths .
The EU and some of its Member States , including my own , have provided emergency financial aid , perhaps a little later than they should have , but they have done so , as have the United States and various countries in the region , particularly South Africa .
It is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters , followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid .
Although these floods began three weeks ago , the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire straits Mozambique currently finds itself in : there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport , particularly air transport , to get them out of the situation they are in .
This is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment : search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid , including food aid .
I would like to emphasise , however , that the EU and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to Mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing .
We must be aware of the aftermath of the floods .
It is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which Mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way .
Rebuilding infrastructure is crucial , because otherwise there can be no development . It is also time for some creditor countries to think about writing off or reducing Mozambique ' s debts .
If nothing is done now , we will be letting all the effort that we have made in the past to help Mozambique in its development go to waste .
I therefore hope that the visit by Commissioner Nielson and representatives of the Portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves .
Mr President , it has already been said that , after a war which engulfed the country in misery , Mozambique is now facing a natural disaster of terrifying proportions .
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died , we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops .
They urgently need aid such as food , water and shelter in order to survive .
This immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics , which have apparently already broken out , and aid for reconstruction .
However , the aid needed now is difficult to get through , despite the efforts of the NGOs , because the roads , bridges and railway lines are damaged .
Helicopters are therefore needed .
Apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees .
The machinery mobilising the aid is too slow .
The PSE Group of this House has suggested that preventing natural disasters , including preventing conflicts , is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of Mozambique .
I must remind you in particular of the efforts of Mr Rocard during the previous term .
The European Commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as DIPECHO . This was intended to be proactive and , using a regional approach , to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population .
However , Africa is surprisingly not included in the DIPECHO plans .
Mozambique , which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster , just as the famine now threatening in Ethiopia was foreseeable , is excluded from these plans .
The DIPECHO agenda includes south-east Asia , Central America and the Caribbean .
This is reasonable and we support this , but we have to ask the Commissioner , why not Africa ?
The PSE Group has always supported the Commission ' s humanitarian aid policy .
We have always supported ECHO , its policies and its actions , even some which have been disputed by certain bodies . We believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the EU ' s external action .
In view of all this , we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States , on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique .
The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars .
The time has also come to demand greater efficiency .
We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon , the Commissioner ' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique .
Mr President , the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency .
Each day , each hour of delay costs many lives .
There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims .
The water levels continue to rise .
Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable .
It is as if the whole world is looking on , helplessly .
The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness .
I must admit that I have my doubts about this .
Commissioner Nielson is flying out today .
In European terms , this may be swift action , but given the emergency in Mozambique , this is probably very late .
Unlike a number of Member States , the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far .
What options does the Commission have , to offer effective help fast ?
What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of ?
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far ?
Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner ?
The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts , not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy , but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential .
Mr President , all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique .
There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons , a large number of dead , a lack of food and drinking water , and homes and crops have been destroyed .
And this is happening in a country which , because it is one of the poorest in the world , does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary .
It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help .
We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation , representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique .
We are pleased about this development , but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately . This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires .
Furthermore , it was precisely for this reason , and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action , that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation . I asked him to join us , as soon as he returns , to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken , and those which we are going to take .
Thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment , and only international solidarity can save them .
I would like to think that the EU is up to the task of providing the people of Mozambique with what they expect from us .
Mr President , I would like to begin by emphasising , first of all , the timing and the topicality of this debate on the devastating floods in Mozambique .
Indeed , these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their possessions , people who cannot return to their homes after the storms , purely and simply because their homes and their belongings no longer exist . They are no longer there , having been swept away in the torrents .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there remains , however , one immediate problem : the need to provide help for all Mozambicans who have been afflicted , many of whose lives are in danger , in their flooded villages , hoping that they will be rescued .
Most of these people can only be saved by aircraft , especially helicopters , of which it is clear that too few are in action .
As the President of Mozambique , Joaquim Chissano , remarked in a dramatic appeal , each passing day may mean death for many Mozambicans .
The EU must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively , in terms of quantity as well as quality , and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this .
We must do this not only in line with basic humanitarian principles and out of solidarity , but also - and quickly - because we know that Mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world .
This means that its resources for coping with the tragedy and then setting about reconstruction are practically non-existent .
We are also under an obligation to help because of another fact , the fact that Mozambique is one of the few African countries to have used democratic means to recover from the bloody civil war by which it was consumed for several years after it gained independence .
It is true that Mozambique ' s democracy is still far from perfect , as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them . But given this situation , which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique , we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique ' s leaders , both those in the government and those in opposition , who , out of a sense of responsibility , have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House ' s attention - which was not really necessary , but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique . I have some figures here , which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available .
More than three hundred people have already died , six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced , two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off , with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated , some of whom are in treetops , others on roofs .
As has already been said , helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid .
Otherwise , apart from the tragedy created by the floods , the next tragedy will arise : that of a lack of aid to the people , who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods .
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all .
The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique , as I have myself , and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake .
I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation , and what the most urgent needs are , so that we can help the people of Mozambique , who genuinely deserve our help , in their struggle for development .
. Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said , the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking .
Children have lost parents , families are bereft , hopeless , helpless and they have lost absolutely everything .
But of course , as others have said , this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate , woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness .
There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place .
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region .
The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet .
85 % of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is .
Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing .
Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million .
We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there .
Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift . As you say tons of food , water purification equipment , tents , blankets .
Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources .
Are we ready to pay for those resources ?
Mozambique is , of course , one of the poorest countries in the world , but one of Africa ' s great success stories with its work on economic growth , on poverty reduction , on democracy in spite , of course , of massive debt pressures .
Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured .
How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country .
Thank you , Mrs Kinnock .
Mr Nogueira , we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure .
The debate is closed .
Union Economy ( 1999 )
The next item is the report ( A5-0041 / 2000 ) by Mr Katiforis , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the Commission document ' The EU Economy 1999 Review ' [ C5-0081 / 2000 - 2000 / 2046 ( COS ) ] .
The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising , especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8 % by the year 2001 .
This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness , of growth of only 1.9 % per year throughout the 1990s , despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were , however , unable to consolidate .
It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves , we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy .
This is the challenge .
Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents .
In Europe , in your rapporteur ' s opinion , this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years , not just once but repeatedly .
Such an attitude has downside risks which I understand the ECOFIN Council is currently discussing .
These risks involve a correction in the US economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long-term EU interest rates .
Should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion , what will be our response - more laissez faire or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn ?
It has been my proposal that Parliament must recommend an activist economic policy consisting of two main parts .
One is to adopt the Commission ' s own excellent , outstanding econometric analysis , and ask the Council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected quantifiable targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible .
A central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19 % , to which it has fallen over the decade , to at least 23-24 % of GDP , both in the private and in the public sector .
To allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy , the Council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most sacred cows .
It would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans-European networks , which have been gathering dust in the drawers for rather too long , to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of European Community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to borrow for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact .
This was the first pillar of my recommendation .
The second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms , privatisation , de-regulation proposals , as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge-based economy which , as we know , constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon Summit .
It has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an expansionary programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the European economy out of its state of inertia while one-sided policies are condemned to fail .
Unfortunately my colleagues of the People ' s Party aided and abetted by the Liberals in the Economic Affairs Committee found my approach unacceptable .
I am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but I must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too unconvincing to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us , have been expecting from us rather too long .
It is certainly not my task to judge other people ' s alliances but if the People ' s Party and the Liberals are so desperate to cement their alliance , let them at least propose something positive , something that has a chance of working , not repeat the same tired old platitudes , ideas that have so singularly failed us in the past , nor oppose other people ' s concrete efforts just for the sake of opposing them .
I believe that the political message of this Parliament should consist of something more original than a mere rehash of the neo-classical economic mantra .
Something more robust than a call to surrender to the fatalities of the market economy , something more decent than opposing dutiful aims but denying them the means of their realisation .
The report which has come to you from the Economic Committee sins in all these respects .
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament , accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group , I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience .
Mr President , Mr Katiforis ' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report .
Instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee .
We clearly have different views , one of which is that we believe the development of the European economy can be regarded with confidence .
Yesterday , when speaking to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , Commissioner Solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the European economy are excellent .
Moreover , several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus .
They are having to choose , for example , between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit , but clearly avoiding any price rises , or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed , given the EU ' s population growth .
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union , now and in the coming years . It must be taken into account that we have an open , globalised and very competitive economy .
In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America , we must avoid interventionism , as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis , and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures .
Furthermore , the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level .
However , we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws .
There are still sectors such as air transport , energy and telecommunications in which , if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level , the cost supported by our companies is very high .
This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union , on average , it is EUR 1 600 .
We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention .
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union .
Mr President , the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis , in my view , only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people , social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union .
This is the objective , in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament : give hope to the people of Europe .
There is indeed economic recovery , but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe .
The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished , and even reversed , the meaning of his message .
That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them , despite our efforts , and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment .
What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report ?
First of all , the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth , but a Europe of sustainable growth , that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires .
There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008 , by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions .
A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport , energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet .
Secondly , even the growth rate of 3 or 4 % , something we consider eminently feasible , will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth .
And we should say so very clearly , it will involve more savings on services , more third systems , more reductions in average working hours , whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things .
Thirdly , we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in Europe , but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital .
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest , where the salary ratio is the most flexible , unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest , where the social relations are the best regulated , the unemployment rate is the lowest .
Mr President , I think that this policy will engender not hope , but deep disappointment in European workers .
The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission , ECOFIN and the Central Bank , but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union .
Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union .
Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts , who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas , failed miserably to muster any support .
With this vote , the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it , by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy ; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything , categorically opposes any form of public sector , overturns workers ' employment , wage , social and insurance rights , imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job .
Our Group categorically condemns this perception and , in this sense , does not intend to support this resolution .
It will be voting against it .
Mr President , the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow .
Indeed , it is good to note that the forecast of 3 % growth for the year 2000 , which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999 , now has a serious chance of being achieved , even in the context of continued inflation , since the peak of 2 % for the euro zone in January , nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past .
But we have the impression that this growth , sustained firstly by the performance of the United States , and then by the productivity gains of the new economy , by the new information and communication technologies , is driven by the general world situation , even despite our handicaps .
We are well aware of these handicaps , which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility , the excessive mandatory levies .
But let us not forget that there is another one , a new handicap , with the single currency .
In fact , the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances .
This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission ' s report .
But , in reality , we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation .
If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State , itself based upon a people , you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels , the markets ' suspicion of the euro .
Indeed , it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999 , as it favoured growth in an unexpected way , but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is , in fact , symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions .
Mr President , the present draft resolution is controversial . Given the topic it covers , this is hardly surprising .
It is , after all , a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things , especially where the future is concerned .
The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment , but it is , in fact , a short-term policy .
Even if he advocates sustainable growth , sustainability does not come into it .
Given the environmental and demographic developments , if anything , we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy .
More investments , production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity .
The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced
Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes .
If Member States do not do anything about this , there will be even fewer means for care , education and other important public amenities in the future .
An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd .
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which , at 2 % , is now at its maximum permitted level .
If , despite this , there is a desire to increase public spending , then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again .
What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular .
High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us , especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting .
Promoting employment , however , is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy .
Member States , in particular , should adopt an effective policy .
In order to achieve this , they must be given the necessary leeway .
Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs .
However , shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us .
Not the report he presented to us here today , but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , because politically speaking , these are two completely different reports .
In very general terms , we could call the first report a left-wing one , as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones .
The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report , from which the main conclusions have been removed , and is based on social concerns .
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report ?
He proposed an ambitious report , based on an optimistic Europe , which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve .
And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets .
Why , for example , was the proposal to increase Europe ' s active population to 75 % of the total population removed , when we currently have levels of around 60 % ?
An active population of 60 % is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries ' levels of production with such a low rate of employment .
We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive .
As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit , we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training .
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate .
We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau , according to which what we need is a flexible workforce .
I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal , where employment laws are not flexible , and where unemployment stands at less than 5 % - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing , with Community support of course , at a rate considerably higher than the Community average .
What we want , therefore , is for Europe to enjoy economic growth , but also be prepared to address social issues .
Mr President , like many others , I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report .
When I read the report and see the picture of the EU ' s economy that is described there , I think it is quite a worrying picture .
Investment levels are too low , unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth .
It is not , therefore , perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies , in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it .
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself , which is something I agree with .
There is far too much talk about stability , convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development .
As far as I am concerned , EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy .
My conclusions about this differ completely , however , from those of the previous speaker .
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources , partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training , democratisation and good social conditions .
In this context , I can , in fact , see the EMU project ' s main weakness , for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above .
Instead , you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the Union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my Group ' s spokesman , Karl von Wogau , for the document that we are debating today , and which has had a report written on it , points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success .
It points to the problems experienced in 1999 , when , notwithstanding the problems , there was currency and price stability , increased employment , the beginnings of a period of upturn , and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment .
In terms of outlook , the document points to an upswing , to long-term prospects and the measures required to achieve this , which Karl von Wogau then proceeded to enlarge upon .
I am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one , for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy .
We want to continue along the successful European path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market , to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures .
The left-wing of this House does not want to continue along this path , rather it makes dramatic statements such as : what we need is state intervention , not the extension and consolidation of the market economy .
State intervention has always led to a high level of debt , and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment , as well as social justice .
That is what the debate we are having is all about , on the subject of which I have this to say to you : we need more freedom and less state intervention .
It is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment .
Mr President , the economic situation of the European Union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people , it is the generalisation of insecurity , of low wages , of deteriorating working conditions .
The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor , whereas in France alone , over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an insane economy .
But you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases shockingly every year .
What you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high , and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market .
Eleven thousand job losses at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc , twenty two thousand at Unilever , ten thousand at ABB / Alsthom Power , not to mention all the others .
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority , the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups .
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed , who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but , on the contrary , are getting worse .
This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us .
This debate , I think , has summed it up .
The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening , and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics , and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear , because this report is a radical one .
This report is a wake-up call to Europe .
This report recommends radical measures , which in essence will make it easier to employ people .
It is as simple as that .
The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets .
This is the only way to go forward , because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs .
This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that , because Europe has to wake up .
It cannot create jobs just by government spending .
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours , as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people .
The real world simply does not work like that .
And if Europe wants to be left behind , left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism , than yes , vote against this report tomorrow .
But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe , then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report , because it will deliver those jobs , and it will deliver those opportunities , and it is the only way to do so .
Mr President , the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations , based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe , for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent .
These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union ' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy , which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment .
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible , my dear Mr von Wogau , for the fall of the euro .
The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research , lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation .
Lastly , the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors ' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services .
These recommendations , which , for the most part , are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency ' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit , have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament , by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets .
Mr President , this Parliament , which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times , must , on this occasion , show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures .
Mr President , Mr Katiforis ' s report is exciting .
In its original form , it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy .
Now , finally , the EU ' s position is , of course , such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget .
It is therefore sad that , in committee , the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously .
The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this .
It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals , namely that the Union ' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments , partly in order to involve all the Union ' s citizens in the information society , something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view .
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States ' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure .
This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people , both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States .
The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but , instead , share the EU ' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field .
Society needs , therefore , to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies , poor regions and ordinary citizens .
We have that opportunity right now .
Let us grasp it .
Mr President , the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before .
I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers ' view that this is such an interesting debate .
I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions .
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision .
I think that , in this way , the European Parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the European Union where a very wide , socio-economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly .
The Portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in Lisbon .
The Commission has done this in its five-year plan by listing one of the four priorities .
The Commission document too , which is being drafted for the summit in Lisbon , takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas .
I think that in adopting this wide socio-economic approach , the European Union is taking exactly the right line , not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted .
In this light , I think that the European Parliament ' s role will be limited in Lisbon , but also in the forum in June for which we might have an invitation , but are unsure as to the input we can have .
Are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still stuck in a mould of old political contradictions ?
.
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I must thank this House for its serious and detailed work .
There is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high-quality information .
There is also no doubt that , throughout the debate this afternoon , we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies .
However , I believe that there are also some elements of consensus .
We all agree that the current economic conjuncture is good .
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment .
I will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which I regard as the essential issue in today ' s debate .
Yesterday , as some of you have noted , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in Europe .
We currently believe that this improvement , which we highlighted in the perspectives in November , may lead to even better results than initially forecast .
Employment is growing at a good rate .
Despite yesterday ' s figures , we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2 % in December shows that this is an issue which must be pursued . However , the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the inflationist tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments .
When we submitted our report , we referred to the risks posed by growth .
We basically highlighted the possibility of encountering difficulties in terms of growth in the USA , and therefore in other parts of the world , and of a sudden rise in inflation .
This latter issue may be particularly significant if it causes cost-push inflation . This is why we are continuing to talk about the need for a wages policy compatible with the definitions of inflation which we want to establish .
Parliament ' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets .
The Commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem .
Anyway , we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more .
We all agree that , after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment , certain action must be taken .
We need public and private investment .
Our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects , among other factors , the imbalances in our labour market .
Our aim must therefore be to make this reactivation of the economy long-lasting with strong growth and job creation .
The latter element continues to be the Commission ' s fundamental objective , as we indicated in the Prodi document submitted for your debate at the Lisbon Summit , in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term .
What policy should we use to achieve these objectives ?
In our opinion , the Union ' s economy is reactivating but we still have idle production capacity , not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs .
The policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully absorbed .
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth .
This is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth ' s sake .
It is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth .
This policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth .
The EU ' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors , on most of which I believe we agree with Parliament ' s analysis .
Firstly , private investment must be assisted .
The Union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way , but without forgetting public investment .
This has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment . However , this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments .
Our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital .
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit .
It is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions . This will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity , thus enabling our society to grow , together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years .
This is the policy which the Commission has defended and will continue to defend in Lisbon .
Common fisheries policy
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
A5-0038 / 2000 by Mrs Attwooll , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy ( COM ( 1999 ) 541 - C5-0302 / 1999 - 1999 / 0218 ( CNS ) ) ;
A5-0037 / 2000 by Mrs Attwooll , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council decision on a financial contribution from the Community towards the expenditure incurred by the Member States in collecting data , and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy ( COM ( 1999 ) 551 - C5-0303 / 1999 - 1999 / 0224 ( CNS ) ) .
The proposals for a Council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a Council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome .
So is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other .
I understand that they have been some five years in their gestation .
With the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002 , it is important that swift progress is now made .
To take first the proposal for the Council regulation , this makes provision for Member States to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations .
Both biological and economic information are included .
The proposal also makes provision for Member States to produce such data in aggregated form .
Exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation .
The implementing regulation will establish a minimum Community programme and an extended Community programme .
It appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective , for example , by type of fish stock .
The proposal for the Council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the Community to Member States engaged in the collection and management of data .
It also allows the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects .
The only apparent sanction for Member States that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme .
Two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the Committee .
The first relates to the degree of involvement of the Commission .
The original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations . The Commission would only receive a copy of any such transmissions if it requested one .
Since , however , the Community is funding the exercise , it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment .
Thus , Amendment No 6 , while maintaining the freedom of Member States to transmit the data to international organisations , requires that it also be sent annually to the Commission .
This change is taken in conjunction with Amendments Nos 1 , 4 and 7 .
Amendment No 1 clarifies the point that , although the data are to be scientifically based , they are being collected for wider decision-making purposes .
Amendment No 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally .
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation .
It is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the Commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole .
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation .
First , in respect to economic data , Amendment No 2 makes two changes .
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued .
The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue , subsidies , interest received , etc . , with a reference simply to volume of sales .
It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality .
In conjunction with these changes , Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly .
Secondly , in respect to the environmental data , the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information .
The Commission has , however , made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind .
It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage .
Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems .
This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary .
It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes .
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish .
As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts .
The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes .
The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects .
There are some minor amendments : Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management , compilation , aggregation , etc .
Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve ; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation .
Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority .
More significantly , under Amendment No 1 , the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1 ( b ) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective .
Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 ' Internal Policies ' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion .
This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available .
) Mr President , I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll ' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals , intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector , come at a critical time .
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner .
This will only be true , of course , if the data can actually be obtained because , as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur , the Commission ' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States .
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance , which is not very significant anyway , will not be received .
In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector , as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs , I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector , we will end up with total confusion . For example , some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources , according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data .
I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management . This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory , as with the MAGPs .
In view of this problem , which seems to me to be the most serious , the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points , particularly with the rapporteur ' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission .
My Group has included two reasonable requests .
The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable . The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission ' s proposal , bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence .
As a result , this report is very satisfactory and , on behalf of my Group , I therefore ask for its approval .
I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report .
I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish .
It is important , of course , that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and , as stated by the rapporteur in her report , must be in compliance with international provisions .
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes , even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met .
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission .
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue .
Sound , factual information is in the best interests of the industry .
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment .
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities , the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports .
Mr President , behind the report , which is an honest one , by Mrs Attwooll , which we shall vote for , we see the European fisheries policy . It is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea , which is immense and without borders , it is not easy to manage fish on the move .
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice .
It is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources , but what is the point if Europe restricts its catches and world catches increase ?
What is the point of banning European drift nets in the île d ' Yeu or elsewhere , if Japan , Korea and Tunisia use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch ?
What is the point of destroying the French fishing fleet , at Sète or elsewhere , for example , if every year France has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed , while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it .
What is more , the movement of fish is like CO2 or like capital , it is not European , but world-wide .
Brussels , which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task , now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset .
Together with Mrs Attwooll , I am in favour of collecting scientific data , and of fair and accurate checks , on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the laxness of the administrations . I am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists , like Professor Aubert , or others , that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with plankton , the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers , which have a much greater effect than human influence .
But to enlighten the decision makers , let us practise honest science , without the ulterior motive of having the European Union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats .
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish , we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen .
Instead of always following behind the United States , in Seattle , in Kosovo , in Iraq , perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest , over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic , in the Pacific , over and above the regulation of tuna , cod or other things , that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing , a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians , Japanese , Canadians , Russians , Europeans , and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity .
That would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism , as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the OECD .
Mr President , Commissioner , to be able to adopt a credible fisheries policy , the Commission needs comprehensive and reliable data on fish stocks and fisheries fleets at its disposal .
The Commission relies on the Member States for the collation of this data .
A Community framework for the collation of this data adds some structure and improves accessibility for the purpose of scientific evaluation .
The question , however , is whether or not the Member States would be prepared , under this new regime , to make the necessary data available at the requested time .
Effective sanctions and / or incentives , which aim to encourage Member States to adopt a more serious approach , are lacking from the Commission ' s proposal .
Moreover , can we rely sufficiently on this information ?
How reliable is fishing data , as long as there are still large amounts of fish being caught illegally , as British fisherman David Cox recently admitted in Fishing News ?
And what should we make of the data on fleet capacity ?
Further to the Court of Auditor ' s criticism , in January this Parliament adopted my amendment to the Cunha report with a large majority .
The amendment requests independent verification of fleet capacity data .
I would like to know from the Commission how it has processed this recommendation , which is also endorsed by the Advisory Committee .
Finally , radical decisions are sometimes mainly based on opinions presented by biologists .
We therefore have everything to gain from improving the accuracy of biological predictions , for example by certifying the drafting of these opinions .
Furthermore , the Commission must provide sufficient financial means for the inspection of stock levels .
It is also recommended that more use be made of the expertise and experience gathered by fishermen when biological opinions are drafted .
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union .
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing .
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry .
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland , a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue .
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves , which have been totally rejected out of hand , for the conservation of their own fish stocks , then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard .
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen ' s representatives , duly accredited , travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared .
That is scandalous , their case ought to be heard .
It should be put on record , and I want to put it on record today .
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special , spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong .
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union .
Mr President , Mrs Attwooll ' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the Member States . This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002 .
However , the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the Commission ' s proposal .
This has happened , as previously mentioned , with the MAGPs . These have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the Commission , compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data .
It should be pointed out that not all the Member States have the same amount of data .
Some have different sectors and , in view of the volume of data to be sent , could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data , if the same deadlines are set .
These deadlines for submission must therefore be staggered accordingly .
Much of this data is confidential , as has also been mentioned , which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises .
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data .
Some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises .
Finally , Mr President , as I must be brief given the time constraints , I must congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Attwooll , on the important work which she has carried out within our committee .
I too want to congratulate Mrs Attwooll and say that I agree with most of what she said .
I regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States .
I cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some Member States to slip without any penalty and I cannot understand either that within a European Union where we are only 50 % self-sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information , that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk .
In view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information , economic as well as biological .
In the past somebody said to me I have been defending the decisions the Commission makes .
It is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the Union to defend the European Union in the whole area of fisheries , but I have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge .
I am informed when I take a closer look that the information is in fact quite higgledy-piggledy with bits coming from here and there and no clear , proper economic and biological picture emerging .
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years ' time about the future of the policy .
It is not easy , indeed I could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing , that the European Union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties .
Well , I do not agree with them but I think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information , and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it , then we will have bad decisions .
Mr President , Commissioner , no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry , particularly in view of the reform of the CFP in 2002 .
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities .
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements .
To this end , more extensive , compatible , uniform data is required , and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union ' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted .
However , we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities , differences , varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries , and that they will not be disregarded , penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies , as has sometimes occurred in the past .
A case in point is the Mediterranean , including my country ' s fishing industry .
After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid , Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy , with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation .
This is a worthy objective , the implementation of which , however , has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish .
A subsequent regulation , Regulation 1448 , adopted , not by chance , in 1999 , permitted certain exemptions , in particular for special cases .
The time period will elapse on 31 May next , to be precise , when the Commission will present a proposal .
We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that , from the point of view of biological implications , resources are , to some extent , sustainable .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Combating certain fish diseases
The next item is the report A5-0036 / 2000 by Mr Hudghton , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93 / 53 / EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases ( COM ( 1999 ) - C5-0168 / 1999 - 1999 / 0191 ( CNS ) ) .
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984 , then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland .
Although the virus has been found in other species , the disease itself is so far confined to salmon .
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists ; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures .
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU , spread throughout some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities .
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually .
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and , if possible , eradicated .
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not .
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible .
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain , let alone eradicate ISA , and while failing to deliver its objectives , the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance .
The proposed changes are twofold : the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle .
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine .
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms , working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm .
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s .
I therefore support the Commission ' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation .
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90 / 424 / EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases , thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50 % Commission , 50 % Member State .
I thank colleagues in the Fisheries Committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and I in particular thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process .
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee .
Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text .
In particular , I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon , the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks .
These amendments by the Green component of the Greens / European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13 .
This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish , whether diseased or not , from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold .
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold .
Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway .
In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective .
In Norway , with their much longer experience , compulsory , 100 % culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation .
It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread .
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA .
This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission , security measures to curtail escapes , treatment of waste and effluent , methods of detection and diagnosis , farrowing and rotation , disinfection of equipment and many , many more .
Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers , others will be incorporated into codes of practice .
All will be beneficial , not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required .
Your votes , colleagues , in favour of my report in full , as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee , will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland ' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others .
I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise .
As he said , fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years , the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend .
Now , as he said , in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually .
Regrettably , although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago , it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another .
Wild salmon , trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment .
But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens , it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans , and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said , that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species .
It can , nevertheless , in the affected fish , lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures .
So this report , Mr President , provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease .
By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling , similar to the system used successfully in Norway , the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence , not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter .
By recommending the research , development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA , the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine .
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Hudghton , also for this report .
Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90 % of the British aquacultural industry .
The industry is located in some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities .
In recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth EUR 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence .
I believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with Infectious Salmon Anaemia which is both practical , realistic and also achievable .
The example of Norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach .
As for the amendments , I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton ' s Green colleagues , that is numbers 7 to 13 , not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because , according to scientific evidence , the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence , human beings at that temperature are dead .
There is a saying that the dead tell no tales and I am sure they do not eat fish but I do and I look forward to the implementation of this report .
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development .
I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate , indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules .
This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming .
Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens , not just in farms affected by ISA .
Secondly , looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening , paragraph 28 is of particular importance .
This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment .
Thirdly , referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data , I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment , not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13 , and I hope honourable Members will reject them .
Mr President , I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues , who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers ' health .
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon , causing death .
It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water , etc .
Under the 1993 directive , not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected , exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution .
What we currently propose is to relax this directive , so that we do not cull all the fish , but only the fish that are found to be diseased .
For the others , well , we would have time to see what would happen , according to local circumstances .
I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way .
I would particularly draw my colleagues ' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that , consequently , there is no risk to men .
What about women ?
Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard .
There is also a risk to the environment , because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that , consequently , if they are eaten , they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk .
There is another risk to the environment as well , because this disease is transmitted to wild fish , as we have seen .
For this reason , together with my colleague , Patricia McKenna , we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission .
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission ' s proposal , in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish , but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy .
Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach , but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community .
This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur .
There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease , fallowing periods , restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others .
Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians , we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster .
And people have spoken in the past about BSE .
For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed .
Had it been at that time , you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money .
So it also has to do with environmental protection .
The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health .

I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening .
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms .
However , this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA .
Nor can it be done , if the proposal involves a threat to public health .
The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously .
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals .
The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals .
The virus harms cold-blooded animals .
It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would , if present in fish for human consumption , be inactivated when ingested .
In no way , however , can diseased fish be used for human consumption .
As an extra precaution , I am validating this advice to our scientific committee .
During the debate , a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation .
I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry .
You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000 , under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance , Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture .
The Commission ' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument .
Council Decision 90 / 424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks .
I must emphasise , however , that there are serious constraints .
Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set .
So further thought is necessary .
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90 / 424 .
This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5 .
I agree , however , with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers .
I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance .
The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon .
The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations .
I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4 .
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers . Those could perpetuate an infection .
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4 .
You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease .
I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom .
I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals .
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised .
In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1 , taking into account , however , that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States .
I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93 / 53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence .
As I pointed out earlier , the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health .
I can therefore agree to Amendment No 10 with the proviso that the words , and I quote , " of the highest possible standard " are replaced by " are safe " .
With regard to the environmental impact , it is a well-known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions : pollution , over-fishing , changes in climate , etc .
It cannot at present be excluded that ISA has an impact on wild stock .
Fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks .
In this context , a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open .
It is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of ISA is needed .
Diseased fish should not remain in the farms and I am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment .
For that purpose , I propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the Commission .
This is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods .
I also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate .
The procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in Community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact .
Bearing this in mind , I can agree to accept Amendment Nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter .
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9 , but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join , at the same time , environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies .
I do not feel in a position to accept Amendments Nos 12 and 13 .
It is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk .
I believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned .
I look forward to Parliament ' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward .
I can partly accept Amendment No 11 .
Finally , I would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the Treaty .
I believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward .
We remain committed to eradicating the disease , an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon-farming sector .
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Byrne .

Protection of juvenile marine organisms

The next item is the report A5-0035 / 2000 by Mr Gallagher , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending for the fourth time Regulation ( EC ) No 1626 / 94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean and for the fourth time Regulation ( EC ) No 850 / 98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms ( COM ( 1999 ) 552 - C5-0040 / 2000 - 1999 / 0222 ( CNS ) ) .
The proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one .
By now , my colleagues in the Fisheries Committee and indeed in the Parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice .
The body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna .
This intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the European Union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic and the adjacent seas including the Mediterranean .
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually , however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice .
The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks .
This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics , finances and administration , compliance and conservation and management measures .
They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna , with temperate tuna , the north and temperate tuna south and other species .
These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention .
Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties .
These conditions are binding , however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period .
The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law .
At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela , changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna .
ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974 , 1994 and 1996 .
As of now , it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos .
At its recent meeting in November 1998 , the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations .
The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans .
It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting .
It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks .
It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine , in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock .
Following all of the research , the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August .
It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations .
Bluefin tuna is the world ' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and , of course , the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons .
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine .
The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles .
The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age .
The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June , I repeat 21 June 1999 , months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date .
Now I believe , Commissioner , this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken , otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past .
Mr President , this proposal aims to incorporate into Community law an ICCAT recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from June 1999 , but which only reached this House at the end of last year .
The Commission ' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us , but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna .
The Mediterranean , particularly in some zones , is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value .
This is why ICCAT recommended this closed zone in the Adriatic and toughened the conditions for catching zero-age fish .
As rightly said by the rapporteur , both measures are totally and fully justified which is why we have no alternative but to ask for their approval .
However , I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law .
We are , for example , still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from Honduras and Belize .
The recommendation for this dates from 1996 . Apparently , according to my information , the Fisheries Directorate-General sent a note last January to the Trade Directorate-General which is still on the preparatory work .
Four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable .
We have listened to the Commission ' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation . This has simply left us with an image of an exasperating bureaucracy .
Yet I have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the Council and Parliament procedure .
It is clear that we must find a solution to this problem , either at the time of the Commission report on regional fisheries organisations or , if possible , before then .
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms .
Indeed , it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources .
All laudable stuff .
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance .
As a king sport fisherman myself , I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds .
I do not know what the metric equivalent is .
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues .
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns .
The common fisheries policy is not working .
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation , the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster .
In mixed fisheries , you cannot discriminate .
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless .
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP .
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it .
Let me illustrate this with a topical example .
In February , Commission Regulation 394 / 2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued .
It means that in Fleetwood , 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April .
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done .
However , more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so .
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Gallagher ' s report on the fourth amendment of the Regulation on technical measures was not amended in our committee . It was actually approved unanimously for which I congratulate the rapporteur .
This also shows that our committee is in total agreement when it comes to supporting measures which aim to protect species , such as tuna in this case .
These decisions must be defended by the Commission in ICCAT . This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament ' s role .
Mr Fischler , I am delighted that the Commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory ICCAT meeting .
Our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded .
I must highlight the part of the report which states that , in 1975 , with regard to the size of bluefin tuna , a minimum limit of 6.4 kg with a 15 % tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire Atlantic .
However , according to the SCRS study , the regulation establishing the 6.4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean fisheries .
The WWF reports that , according to Italian , French and Spanish customs authorities , illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase .
I cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time .
However , I must again congratulate our rapporteur , Mr Gallagher .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Fishing and the environment ( Bergen 13-14 March 1997 ) : 2nd report
The next item is the report ( A5-0016 / 2000 ) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the second report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of the " statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues , 13-14 March in Bergen " ( COM ( 1999 ) 270 - C5-0156 / 1999 - 1999 / 2150 ( COS ) ) .
Mr President , Mr Fischler , my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues , as discussed at the ministerial meeting in Bergen .
This integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general .
To fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow , not just for our fishermen and the people of Europe but , more seriously , for humanity as a whole .
The common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect , perhaps more so than most people , both Europeans and non-Europeans , would believe .
I have therefore asked the European Commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at conserving and protecting resources . This will serve to publicise our protectionist actions .
We have also asked Parliament ' s own DG IV to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the Committee on Fisheries .
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us . We must completely overhaul , modernise or , if you prefer , update this policy in its entirety .
I would stress that the whole of the CFP must be revised , particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks .
This is the basis of my request to the European Commission and the services of this House .
I do not believe that the state of stocks and the current scandalous system of discards are a good example of the policy ' s effectiveness which must therefore , in my opinion , be significantly improved .
I do not want to and cannot go into too much detail , Mr President , given the time constraints and also the interpreters ' fees .
However , I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created .
The President-in-Office informed our committee that the current Portuguese presidency intended the CFP to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources . This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world .
In this respect , important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee . These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass , reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources , protecting juveniles , species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries .
These initiatives , together with effective systems of control , are the key aspects for the future of fisheries .
However , we do not have to resort to extreme solutions , as Mr Katiforis initially suggested in his draft report .
I am referring to this now because I will not have time to speak later on .
I must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr Katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee .
Coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part-session both my report and Mr Katiforis ' s report on fisheries and the environment .
The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow .
Maritime transport , industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment
The next item is the report A5-0017 / 2000 by Mr Katiforis , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the communication from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament : Fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment ( COM ( 1999 ) 363 - C5-0176 / 1999 - 1999 / 2155 ( COS ) ) .
The problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this House many times in the past .
This particular communication from the Commission forms part of the Commission ' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other Community policies .
The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over-exploitation and / or environmental degradation .
The alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks dwindle and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports .
I understand I have been described in a Spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things .
Of course , I am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting .
This is an unwise policy .
In particular , the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems , improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment , in the graded management of coastal areas , improved training , information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management .
All of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the Community level and in the various international fora in which the Community participates .
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates .
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission ' s worthy intentions in this field , it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made .
One can quote from the communication .
Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent .
That appeared in the communication published last July .
Since then , the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000 .
Furthermore , the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod , effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species .
These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation .
What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities ?
The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced .
Secondly , the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party .
Thirdly , the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources .
More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils .
Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas .
Such pressures are greatest in Europe .
In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches , fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures .
A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative .
Under this system , and given the total allowable catch for a species , a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves , fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time .
The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves .
Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry .
At present dear colleagues , we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea , nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system .
However , we should never blind ourselves to scientific research , we should never cease to gather information , we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and , if necessary , we should at least consider policy changes .
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector .
I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information , the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism .
I recommend the report to the House .
The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments .
It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch .
We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy .
After all , the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies .
But as has been pointed out , the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial .
This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual .
The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard .
One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control .
All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected .
Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries .
This is a good step forward , but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out , much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
Mr President , fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment . Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions .
However , some people ' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic , ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators .
I regret to say that this report , due to its link with the environment , seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions .
If Mr Katiforis ' s report had been approved in its initial wording , none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched .
The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious .
Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport .
To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong .
Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14 , many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely .
Just when we thought the discussions had ended , a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly .
According to these , for example , the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea .
Others , like Amendment No 4 , which request financing for biological closures , also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force , although admittedly there is room for improvement in these .
I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee ' s debate . These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks .
As I have said many times before , the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika .
Mr President , Mr Katiforis ' s report has the virtue of having brought life , debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions , although recognising its inability to put these into practice .
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which , in his opinion , could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea .
Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries .
I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated .
However , what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations .
Maritime transport , employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment .
As for the Structural Funds , certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day .
The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries .
The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria . The same yardstick should be used for everyone .
As Mr Katiforis says , discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept .
Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back .
The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear .
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities .
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector .
It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message .
Without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control , damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity .
Mr President , I very much appreciate this report by Mr Katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment .
Let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first ' environmental ' disaster , Minamata disease , occurred in 1958 in Japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury .
We should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity , but also from domestic activity .
I do not believe that ejecting emissions at sea , and particularly in a closed environment like the Mediterranean , when we want to clean up purification plants , is a good way to clean up water .
We should pay particular attention to telluric pollution , to development , to the urbanisation of coastal areas , etc .
But we should also think about restoring the environment and , for example , solving the problems associated with caulerpa taxifolia , and the areas of posidonia that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected .
They say that if you want something done , it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea , the fishermen , must be very attentive .
It will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40 % , as proposed by the Commission , has been very greatly watered down by the Council , to between 5 and 10 % .
It will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and , together with my colleague , Nol Mamre , who is also a former Member of the European Parliament , we would request a moratorium on the use of deep-sea trawlers in Community waters in the Bay of Biscay , to the south of the 47th parallel north , because we have had enough of seeing dolphins being washed up and dying on our beaches , particularly at the moment .
So we must practise selective fishing .
Aquaculture should also be monitored .
Read Mr Katiforis ' s report again , in which he says that in Scotland , for example , 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that I just mentioned , and impact upon the environment .
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment .
The Council of Europe is coming before the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy on 22 March to speak about the research work that must be undertaken , particularly in the marine environment and , more precisely , the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would ask you to come and take part in this discussion .
Mr President , the Katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals , notably , of the Europe for a Union of Nations Group , which were adopted in the Committee on Fisheries and , in my opinion , this version is an improvement on the original .
I would like to touch briefly on these amendments .
With regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems , we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible , although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them , of course , as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make , and also in view of the fact that , in any case , satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels .
We welcome the report ' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system , as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States .
Moreover , with regard to the protection of coastal areas , which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish , we hope for tighter controls , which , in our opinion , should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea .
In effect , this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management .
More specifically , with regard to fisheries management in the Mediterranean , we are all aware that fishing in the Mediterranean is not governed by provisions on TACs .
And just as well , in my view .
As you may be aware , in contrast with the cold Northern seas , the Mediterranean is a small , warm sea where there are very few , if any , schools of only one species of fish .
In our opinion , the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate .
Lastly , we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left .
We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force : in short , we must make it possible to carry on a major , responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment .
Mr President , first of all , I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment : pollution , unsupervised fishing , drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore , and fishing is also a victim of this situation .
There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment .
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential , as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore , as well as in coastal waters .
A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation .
In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene , the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors .
Moreover , it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly : in reality , in some cases , small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources .
I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources , and I also welcome the Commission ' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour , in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life .
Mr President , as a member of the Verts / ALE Group , but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia , I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues . I shall , of course , be brief .
Firstly , fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin .
Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living , for without it , the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed .
Secondly , it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in Community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries .
This particularly applies , however , to our own coastal waters .
Given this context , I would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago .
I discovered that the EU is using ERDF resources to finance the construction of a wharf in Vilagarcia , in Galicia , for storing chemical and hydrocarbon products , on a site which will only employ three workers . This contravenes the EC environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as Arousa , where 26 000 people earn a living from the seafood industry .
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it .
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep . It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally .
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where , when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union .
Commissioner Fischler , of course , knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries , along with his lusty colleagues , because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland .
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense , without any real negotiation or discussion .
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period .
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks , but what I am really saying to you Commissioner , and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again : There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen .
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia , it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland .
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide .
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen .
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you , as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries , will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Bankruptcy procedures
The next item is the report A5-0039 / 2000 by Mr Lechner , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the initiative of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Finland , with a view to the adoption of a Council regulation on insolvency proceedings ( 9178 / 1999 - C5-0069 / 1999 - 1999 / 0806 ( CNS ) ) .
Mr President , I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created .
We also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and , what is more , concepts .
The very word bankruptcy , the legal concept of bankruptcy , does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the Member States of the Union .
We therefore all agree on the established facts , and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction .
If I may , however , just make a few comments on the method .
When you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts , and the fact that we wish to improve coordination , I believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed .
The first is to establish equivalence , saying : in the final analysis , bankruptcy in France is the same thing as bankruptcy in England or in Germany .
The second way is to recreate a law ex nihilo , that is to say , to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the Member States .
That is not the route that has been taken .
The third route that has been taken is in the end to superimpose above the existing systems , which are not touched , a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty .
This is a good thing , moreover , and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for .
But at this stage I should like to make an observation , which is not technical , but more philosophical and taken from practice .
It is that bankruptcy is experienced within the European Union , in the majority of States , as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects .
And I believe that it is our responsibility , in an ever more rapidly moving economy , where everyone must have a real opportunity , to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise , and a second and a third chance , if necessary .
Today , in many Member States , that is not possible .
One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the European area , for example and the United States , is precisely this ability of bouncing back that exists on the other side of the Atlantic and that we just do not have here .
I believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path , which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the European Union , we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the guillotine .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe , in fact , that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers .
When we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market , we must also deal with the darker side , namely bankruptcies .
I consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard .
I congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report .
I am , moreover , proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the Council .
I think it is an important step we are taking , even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it .
To the rapporteur ' s regret , I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors ' legal position and impairs their legal protection .
With regard to Amendment No 6 , we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee .
I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then .
We shall now support your Amendment No 6 , but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee .
I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries .
. ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings .
As you all know , this convention was the result of many years of discussion , which was often difficult and often laborious , and that for this very reason , it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles , that is to say , the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States .
Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation , and particularly the single market , can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings , which often take the form of cross-border proceedings , the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles , thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly .
For better or for worse , the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life .
It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business , which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable .
This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy .
It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States , Germany and Finland , by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues .
The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention .
As far back as 1981 , the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings .
Furthermore , this view was accepted in the Commission ' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses .
The 1995 Convention , on the other hand , authorises the filing of secondary proceedings , thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted .
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted , one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings .
Nevertheless , I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was , moreover , based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years .
Consequently , the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment . Instead , it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues .
The Commission feels , for this reason too , that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation , but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission ' s opinions on the amendments under discussion .
The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur , Mr Lechner .
On the other hand , it does not accept Amendment No 4 .
Indeed , the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission , assisted by a regulatory committee , in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999 / 468 / EC .
Therefore , with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4 .
On the other hand , it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2 , on the idea of " centre of the debtor ' s main interests " .
With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person , this idea is clearly defined in Article 3 .
In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed , we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient .
Shipwreck of the Erika
The next item is the oral question ( B5-0011 / 2000 ) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , to the Commission , on the shipwreck of the Erika .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today .
Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments .
He must have reconsidered and , in so doing , has , as usual , shown great respect for this House . I thank him for this .
On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika .
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue .
Firstly , we must show the Commission , the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident .
Secondly , we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster , namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions .
The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future .
Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event .
We must now get down to adopting measures , Commissioner .
Firstly , efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport , particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved .
The construction of these vessels , the use of double hulls , their age , their control by classification companies , insurance , the creation of databases containing all relevant information , Community cooperation and coordination , the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled . Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas ?
Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport , particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling ' responsible fisheries ' .
Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled .
We expect concrete action from the European Commission . The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important , well-developed and prestigious .
The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage . It must also indicate all the specific measures , including political , economic , social and financial measures , which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight .
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained ?
How can those affected be compensated ?
This is a very serious problem which the European Union , as an economic , commercial , industrial and fishing power , must tackle .
We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations .
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future .
This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries .
We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission , with plenty of action and no more regrets .
This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups .
Mr President , the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years .
In addition to destroying natural resources , this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors , particularly those dependent on fisheries .
With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel , the situation could still deteriorate .
The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore . These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself .
The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance . They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which , unfortunately , is not an isolated event .
The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature , which is nowadays too often being punished by man ' s activities .
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities .
Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes .
Surely the budget would agree , as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these .
Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked .
Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression , perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée , that , as the Fisheries Commissioner , he is not always available or , at best , available only on a part-time basis .
As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January , the needs of the severely affected fisheries , ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account .
We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds .
Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks .
We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience .
Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this .
We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen .
The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate .
It is time that polluters started to pay because , up to now , it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid , and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well .
I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler ' s response , particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted .
On behalf of the PSE Group , I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected , to the fishermen , farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market .
My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians , to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support .
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner .
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable .
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people .
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission ' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly .
It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified , where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two .
The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address .
This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future .
The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern , and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this , is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future .
Will it really address the concern or will , in practice , in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas , the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause .
Mr President , our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster , but good intentions are not enough , there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment .
We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation , and for this to be backdated .
We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection , and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority , and also , in particular , of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory .
We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats .
Finally , we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic , with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million .
This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products .
This is not acceptable . We only found out too late and , as a result , medical inspection must be provided , paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment .
Finally , we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks , as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage .
A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation .
Solutions cannot be found at the last minute , when the disaster is already in progress .
Consequently , the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand .
Mr President , over two months after the wreck of the Erika , pollution of the coasts , which have already been cleaned once , is still continuing .
While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this , I should like to salute the dedication of the workers , professionals and volunteers , who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches .
Thanks to the grass-roots involvement , which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January , an initial raft of measures has been announced .
The French Government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection .
The lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full , and decisions must be taken speedily at Community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or berthing in our ports , to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants , and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection .
We must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution .
So , yes , Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological , economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster .
The French State has released funds for compensating damage .
I feel , however , that the European Union has so far not actually come up with any expression of Community solidarity at the requisite level .
So , yes , appropriations must be released at Community level to support the cleaning of the contaminated coastlines , to assist the organisations which went into action to save oil-covered birds , and to contribute towards getting the affected businesses back on their feet .
Specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence .
I was pleased to hear the statement which Commissioner Fischler has just made , and I take careful note of the commitments he made before this House .
I should also like to say that my Group shall remain vigilant and committed , in collaboration with the grass-roots action groups , to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level , supported by realistic penalties in the event of non-compliance .
Mr President , the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick , two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika , is because the extent of the economic , social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is , in fact , far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand .
Cakes of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the Atlantic coastline on a daily basis .
Curiously , the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified .
The ecological disaster is a major one , possibly unprecedented in scale .
Large-scale degassing proliferates and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution .
All workers in the fishing , fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard .
The chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in Europe .
The frontline victims are the producers or freight forwarders banned in the Vendée and Loire-Atlantique regions .
Some of them have already lost several years ' worth of harvests , but the 50 % to 80 % slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the Atlantic coastline , and even those in the Channel and North Sea .
As regards fishing proper , passive gear fishing is currently the hardest hit .
After shellfish , the slump is now affecting crustacean sales .
The many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and , above all , the future of fishery products , an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years , now hangs entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs , unfortunately , of initial disenchantment .
The two principle resources of the Atlantic shore , fishing and tourism , both closely interrelated , have both been seriously affected .
There is a danger that the season will be lost , resulting in an extremely serious crisis by the end of the year .
The fact that Parliament is presenting a new resolution , one to which our Group has made a significant contribution , is therefore perfectly justifiable .
It emphasises a number of points deemed crucial at grass roots level .
The first point is that the polluter must accept his liability in full .
Our resolution calls for two principles to be applied : the first is the ' polluter cleans ' principle , since it is unacceptable that the cleaning of coasts polluted by hydrocarbon cargoes should be borne by the local authorities , i.e. the taxpayers , i.e. the victims , and not the cargo owner .
The second principle is the ' polluter pays ' principle .
According to our resolution , the polluter ' s liability must extend to fishing , fish farming and aquaculture industries and businesses .
This is essential . It means that the polluter cannot claim to limit the amount of compensation for victims in line with the ceiling set by FIPOL , which is to say , by the goodwill of the major oil companies .
If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient , and it has clearly been underestimated , then it must be raised .
Our resolution calls for this .
If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance .
It would be particularly unfair to have an oil company , whose profits this year amount to FRF 10 billion , refusing to give 100 % compensation to its own victims , the great majority of whom are small businesses and employees .
Commissioner , the stricken people await tangible expressions of solidarity at European level .
Our resolution calls upon the Commission to take the necessary steps to assist in repairing the damage caused in the fishing industry affected by the consequences of the disaster .
Maritime Europe and the CFP must today demonstrate that , in addition to imposing constraints on fishermen , it is not unfamiliar with the concept of solidarity .
The European Union must also participate in the restoration of the wetland and coastal environments affected , whose biological value is important to the Union as a whole .
Mr Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France ' s requests . I am pleased to hear it .
We must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution .
Twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster laxness and irresponsibility still reign supreme in Europe in matters of maritime safety , resulting in yet more oil slicks .
This time , we must not let inertia win the day .
A basis for maritime safety must be drawn up speedily , respecting the principle of subsidiarity , and we must at long last put an end to this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility .
Mr President , the economy of the western Atlantic coastline has been devastated , polluted by oil from the Erika .
Fishermen , oyster farmers , shellfish farmers , workers in the tourist industry , and local and regional authorities are growing impatient while waiting for aid and for someone to deal with the time-bomb which the apparently still leaking wreck represents .
Having withdrawn the budget line for ' natural disasters affecting Member States ' with such poor timing , Europe has a duty to respond , firstly in the name of solidarity but also because it shares responsibility in this umpteenth oil slick disaster .
European citizens find it hard to understand why Europe accepts conditions which the Americans refuse and why Europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has until now blocked any measures to do with maritime safety .
Europe must pass legislation at the earliest possible opportunity and investigate the matter of this wreck thoroughly , but , in the meantime , the Commission must , as a matter of urgency , harness European funds to aid the businesses affected in order to deal with the wreck , clean up the coastline , increase the capacity of waste storage facilities , ensure that waste is processed or recycled , and set up a research programme into the recovery of oil spilt at sea .
Finally , the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for ' natural disasters involving Member States ' , and make the regions affected eligible for Structural Funds .
What is the Commission ' s view of these proposals ?
What decisions has the Commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take ?
How did the Commission follow up the resolution which the European Parliament adopted on 20 January 2000 ?
We have not , thus far , seen any practical action whatsoever .
Mr President , echoing the thoughts of a number of Members , I should like to tell you that , two and a half months after the wreck , the situation remains particularly critical and every day the scale of the disaster becomes even more apparent .
There are two aspects , the first being the environmental angle .
The wreck still contains 16 000 tonnes of heavy gas oil which is leaking and , in addition to these leaks , unfortunately , last week we observed and counted 35 acts of ecological piracy , 35 degassing operations , disgracefully aggravating this already catastrophic situation .
Mrs de Palacio expressed her views at length regarding this issue and I feel she set to work without waiting for an element which today is absolutely essential , a draft European maritime law , following a draft directive on the maritime transportation of dangerous goods .
From this point of view , this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety .
The secondary impact , however , is proving to be on the economy , the primary impact being environmental and only the second economic , as many Members have stated .
Shellfish farming , fishing , oyster farming and fish farming are today seriously affected , for the effects of the oil slick have been compounded by the storm damage affecting many areas .
Unfortunately , these sectors have been devastated : they have first to rebuild and then , perhaps the most difficult thing , to regain consumer confidence .
Confronted with this situation , the inhabitants of Brittany , the Vendée and Charente , as well as the forestry workers in other regions , await a signal from the European Union .
We cannot claim that rapprochement with the citizens is the touchstone of this legislative period if , at the same time , we hold our tongues and do not offer practical responses in the face of phenomena of this magnitude .
I took very careful note of Commissioner Fischler ' s remarks , perhaps the most practical suggestions we have heard to date .
There have been many declarations of sympathy and solidarity , and many announcements , admittedly , but now it is time for expectations to be met with a tangible display of European solidarity .
The Erika oil spill is one of a catalogue of disasters that have taken place in recent years in Community waters , including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress off Wales .
These spills , in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage , have devastated local industries .
In the case of the Erika , the local fishing and aquaculture industries have suffered a bitter blow and it is important not just to look at the harmful effects that are apparent today but also to look ahead at the long-term detrimental effects of oil pollution .
Effective compensation is essential .
It is time that shipping safety within the Community was tightened up and that greater controls were introduced , including bringing an end to the use of flags of convenience which is also increasingly resorted to in the fisheries sector .
The companies responsible , the ship and the cargo owners must pay up for their negligence .
The current compensation funds are inadequately funded and this was all too apparent in the case of the Braer disaster where the Shetland Islands fishing industry was inadequately compensated for their losses .
We must learn from past experience and make sure that the industries affected by the Braer spill can be rebuilt .
Mr President , today , once again , it is necessary to discuss the Erika disaster , two and a half months after it occurred , because its tragic consequences are far from over .
Now we must continue both to apply pressure , together with citizens ' organisations , to ensure that Total pays the full costs for everything destroyed due to its unbridled pursuit for profits , and also to make a firm commitment to ensuring that this type of disaster never happens again .
Even though the joint motion for a resolution is an interesting one , it does not tackle the subject of flags of convenience , a problem which must be both condemned and resolved as a matter of urgency if we are to contribute to the principle of preventing maritime disasters .
It is actually not so much a matter of improving safety checks on these flags of convenience , as stipulated in the resolution , as actually working right now to eliminate their existence .
This is the only solution to ensure that seafarers ' living and working conditions are satisfactory , that they are covered by effective legislation and social protection , and that fishing operations and the environment are respected .
Parliament adopts a resolution after every maritime disaster . Generally it puts forward positive technical measures , some of which are adopted in directives .
If they were applied , they would in fact serve to counter the idea of cutting costs to the minimum , a policy which is maintained through flags of convenience .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the capacity of rapporteur for the directive on port reception facilities , one of whose objectives is the prevention of marine pollution , I would like to make a few observations which occurred to me on matters which , to my mind , were not sufficiently dealt with at the Green Shipping Conference in Hamburg which everyone attended .
It was stated at this conference that disasters account for 5 % to 10 % of oil pollution .
This may be very concentrated and create many problems , but it is industry which is responsible for 60 % of pollution .
And , by way of an indication , 10 % is caused by natural pollution .
What I would like to propose within the framework not so much of technical improvements , better inspection or improved legislation ( which , I admit , are all necessary ) but , rather , within the framework of socially responsible management , is a kind of round-table conference comprising those involved in , and affected by , the pollution of the seas with oil .
I would like to advocate this .
I want to thank Commissioner Fischler for his answer to the oral question tabled by our committee . He has given us some important information .
The Commissioners who appear before this House armed with specific and important information are always to be thanked .
With regard to the specific case of the Erika , measures are being taken and action is being coordinated with the French authorities .
Our main concern has been that we do not end up discussing this type of event again . Preventative measures are the answer to the question of what can we do .
It has been said that the Commission will meet to adopt a range of technical and legal measures .
This is the right way to go .
These measures are very welcome and the Committee on Fisheries will monitor these very closely so that we do not have to spend more time in this House regretting such disasters .
I have received 5 motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 42 ( 2 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place at 11 a.m.
EC-Israel trade agreement
The next item is the oral question ( B5-0012 / 2000 ) by Mrs Morgantini and others , to the Commission , on the irregular application of the EC-Israel trade agreement .
What we are about to discuss is really very simple : the respect , application and monitoring of the agreements subscribed to by the European Union , and compliance with the Treaties and international standards to which it adheres .
It is very simple , but in this world the simplest things are very often the hardest things to achieve .
The goal of my colleagues who joined me in tabling this question to the Commission is this : the correct application of the EC-Israel trade agreement , which - we not only have reason to believe but , together with several Member States , have concrete proof - is being blatantly violated by Israel .
At the same time , we also have reason to believe that the Commission is failing to attend to one of its primary functions : guardianship of the Community Treaties .
I refer to Article 38 of the territorial requirement which restricts the scope to the territory of the State of Israel and thus does not grant special customs arrangements for products coming from the territories which were occupied by Israeli armed forces in June 1967 and upon which , in breach of all the international rules , from the fourth Geneva Convention onwards , the different Israeli governments have built settlements , confiscating Palestinian land and water and installing their own people .
This is not the first time that the Commission and Parliament have tackled this issue : I will only cite here the Commission ' s report to the Council and Parliament , published in May 1998 , which did not accept Israel ' s refusal to apply the protocol of the rules of origin as laid down in Article 38 .
In spite of this , the Commission was not able to induce Israel to respect these agreements , and only gave vague responses to parliamentary questions , maintaining that it was difficult to obtain reliable proof of the provenance of products , although it has consistently , and quite rightly , made the legal obligations imposed by the agreement clear to Israel .
In order to make it easier for the Commission and the Member States to get hold of reliable evidence , an Israeli peace movement published a list of companies established in the settlements , and a Palestinian NGO prepared and presented the customs services of the various Member States with unequivocal proof attesting to the State of origin of a range of products coming from the occupied territories and traded on domestic Community markets .
I will mention but a few , which are produced in the Golan Heights and the occupied territories : wine and other products .
This is a time of peace in Palestine and Israel : right now the credibility and observance of the legal effect of treaties and agreements is important if the European Union and Parliament want to play an active political role .
Israel can be certain that Europe is in favour of its security and stability , but it cannot ask us to be party to such grave violations .
The Palestinians know that the European Union is in favour of the consolidation of their State and their rights , but they have no proof of this .
Peace cannot be founded on the violation of rights - Israelis such as the soldier Igal Moshe , who refused to go to the Lebanon four days ago and who is now in prison , are proof of this ; Palestinians who still want peace , despite the fact that their houses have been levelled and that , 50 years on , they are still refugees , are proof of this ; above all , respect for ourselves and for the democratic principles which we have laid down for ourselves demand it .
Allow me to say , however , on a more practical level , that , for the same Member States and the Union , this also concerns the loss of economic resources taken from European citizens in violation of human and economic rights .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the questions you put to the Commission , Mrs Morgantini , concern possible illegal exports to the European Community from Israeli settlements or from the occupied territories benefiting from preferential treatment , and which therefore cast doubt on whether the rules on preferential origin are being properly applied .
I shall try to provide you with the additional information you are now seeking on this matter .
First of all , with regard to the lack of clarity in the agreement , I can confirm that the provisional agreement between the EC and Israel on trade and related matters specifies that it applies to the territory of the Member States of the European Community and , I quote , " the territory of Israel " .
The EC consequently takes the view that there is absolutely no lack of clarity about the specifications given in his written answer by Commissioner Patten when he said , and I quote in the original English :
" ... as already explained in the communication , Israeli settlements or occupied territories cannot be considered by the Community as part of Israeli territory for implementation of the EC-Israel agreement .
This issue is highly sensitive , in as far as it relates to the broader question of borders , to Israelis and Palestinians alike " .
We have repeatedly stated this position to the Israeli authorities at every official meeting between the Commission and the relevant Israeli minister , the most recent of which was held on 21 January . On that occasion , the Prime Minister , Shimon Peres , attended a meeting with Romano Prodi , the President of the Commission , and with Commissioner Patten .
It was furthermore widely known , as you have just said , Mrs Morgantini , that Israel ' s interpretation of the territory to which the agreement applies does not match our own . The Commission believes , however , that our interpretation is completely unambiguous .
Hence , the relevance of your second question on the effectiveness of the verification system .
The procedure for verifying the origin of products enables us to determine if a product may be benefiting from the right to preferential treatment , even if there is no cooperation on the part of the third country involved in determining the product ' s origin .
In our written answer to you , the Commission mentioned simplifying the procedure for determining the origins of a product . Of course , this does not mean that this alone will solve the problem or , in other words , that simplifying this procedure would automatically lead to a clearer indication of the product ' s origin .
As long as the customs services of the various Member States identify consignments which may not have originated in Israel , and as long as this is done by the national customs authorities , the Commission , for its part , will - to the extent that it is empowered to do so - maintain its dialogue with the Israeli authorities . In so doing , it will seek to ensure that the protocol on the rules of origin is properly applied in accordance with the only interpretation which the Commission can accept .
In the event that these initiatives , which are currently under way , do not enable the origin of a product to be determined , the Commission may have to look at the possibility of calling a meeting of the Customs Cooperation Committee , in which the differences of opinion on verification procedures in this kind of agreement could be resolved .
With regard to the new measures , the Commission has , at official meetings with the Israeli authorities , discussed in great detail the issue of the application of the agreement , for which there are clearly defined procedures .
In January of this year , the Israeli authorities suggested setting up a tripartite working group comprising representatives of the Palestinian authorities , of the Israeli Government and of the Commission .
The aim of this working group would be to find mutually acceptable solutions for the transition period , without prejudice to the final outcome of the discussions currently taking place . Nor would they contravene the agreements which will remain in force until a final agreement is reached .
President Arafat accepted this proposal at a meeting on 24 January with Commissioner Patten . The Commission is therefore seeking to confirm to both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian authorities that we are willing to accept this proposal , which we feel will allay the concerns that you have raised here , Mrs Morgantini .
Mr President , the difficulties faced by the peace process in the Middle East are well known . As for the political obstacles to be tackled , these are all too apparent .
The weight of the political problem is in fact so great that it could discourage us when considering an obstacle such as the incorrect application of this trade agreement , which in principle is only a legal problem .
Some might therefore consider it reasonable to argue that , since the irregular exports to Europe from the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are not regarded as a priority political problem , these should be halted until a final peace agreement is achieved .
However , I believe that the repeated failure to comply with previously concluded legal agreements , combined with the accumulated frustration at non-compliances in other areas , could become a political issue which might prejudice the peace process itself .
Specifically and regrettably , in a conflict like the Israeli or Palestinian conflict , everything ends up being politicised if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent this happening .
In this respect , the answer given by Mr Prodi , at the beginning of his trip to the Middle East just two days ago , to a journalist ' s question on this issue , is nonsense .
He said that this issue was not on the agenda as this only concerned political issues .
Frankly , I believe that the Commission must act if it is proven that preferential access to Community markets is being gained by products originating from these settlements .
As the Commission itself states and international law determines , these settlements are not part of the territory of the State of Israel . The fact that Europe is basing its actions on international law in its relations with the parties to the peace process can only benefit Israel .
Finally , I want to ask the Commission , which I am sure intends to apply the current agreement , if it has planned any special additional effort or mechanism to make this application more effective in this particular case .
Mr President , Commissioner , since the signing of the Oslo Agreements in 1995 , Israeli-Palestinian relations have entered a new phase , which should lead to a fair and lasting peace between partners which respect each other .
The Union has played an invaluable part in this process , in its capacity as the primary source of economic aid to the region .
The main reason for the problems of implementing trade agreements between the European Union and Israel , as has already been said , is the intractable problem of frontiers .
The Israeli interpretation is not the same as the Union ' s , as the Commissioner mentioned .
At all events , it is a process currently under negotiation , a difficult one , but one that we all wish to see succeed .
This is essentially a political process and the Union would be ill advised to look for a merely technical solution which would only be temporary , given the lack of legal frontiers between the two States .
The settlement process must proceed by the only possible avenue , i.e. that of dialogue .
A tripartite working group , comprising Palestinian and Israeli specialists as well as those of the Commission , should thus be set up .
In this context , we may hope that the parties involved will manage to settle their differences and establish a creative solution for this transitional period .
As was the case in Europe fifty years ago , the social and economic development of the Middle East is an essential condition for peace .
We therefore have some expertise to bring to bear on the subject and we are particularly well placed to gauge the extent of what has already been achieved .
Hopefully the Israelis and Palestinians will demonstrate the same optimistic faith in goodwill .
Mr President , Commissioner , the peace process in the Middle East is an extremely delicate matter .
It will only be possible for the exact borders of the state of Israel , the only democracy in that region , to be universally recognised once these negotiations have proved to be a success .
The trade agreement between the European Union and Israel , which equally fails to define the territory of the state of Israel , should be implemented against this background .
In addition , there is a significant connection between the economic activities within Israel and those on Palestinian territory .
With this in mind , the Paris Protocol to the Oslo agreements also provides for a customs " envelope " comprising the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
Furthermore , the Commission and said parties have agreed to set up a joint working party to discuss issues concerning products ' countries of origin .
The Palestinian economy in particular is said to suffer under unilateral EU measures .
Potential investors in this area have already indicated that they would withdraw if joint ventures were no longer given preference .
Mr President , in general terms this House shares the concern expressed in Mrs Morgantini ' s question .
Commissioner Vitorino has clarified the Commission ' s position and , in my opinion , has responded adequately to the concerns raised here . However , I feel that we should not leave the matter there .
Starting from this previous statement , the lines of agreement could be extended on the basis of the privileged information which Mrs Morgantini and myself were able to obtain when we accompanied the President of this House on a tour of the area .
Firstly , despite the current difficulties which we saw for ourselves in situ , we must repeat our support for the direct dialogue between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority which is producing a fair , stable and definitive peace agreement .
Secondly , it is in the interests of both parties to ensure the economic development of the region and to take decisive action to reduce the serious imbalances in the distribution of wealth in the area .
Thirdly and finally , perhaps the Commission could bear in mind the usefulness of participating in the work of a tripartite working group , naturally involving the European Union , to guarantee compliance with trade agreements and to ensure progress in the assistance offered by the European Union to all the parties concerned .
I have to say that I am satisfied with Commissioner Vitorino ' s response : I feel that , on the whole , his speech did respond to the points raised in the question .
I agree that we must emphasise the importance , for the European Union and therefore , from an executive point of view , for the Commission , of encouraging tripartite activities , particularly as regards levels of economic / financial and scientific cooperation . In this way , our financial involvement could be converted rather more often into a more significant political presence in the Middle East .
This , in my opinion , is the lesson to be learned from such a long-drawn-out affair .
With regard to the subject under discussion , I have just heard Mr Galeote and Mr Menéndez del Valle refer , respectively , to the visit of our President and that of President Prodi to Israel and other countries in the Middle East .
I feel that the two Presidents were right not to include this point in their agendas : there is a time and place for everything and , of course , the priorities are different at different levels .
I feel that it was right for the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission to tackle the most sensitive issues of the peace process which , as we are aware , is still running into difficulties .
We need to lend this peace process our full support , and our concern over the issues described in the question put by Mrs Morgantini is not preconceived , nor is it indicative of a negative attitude towards any of the parties concerned .
We are being cruel to be kind . We are being strict with our friend , the Israeli Government , to prevent repetition of these illegal occurrences and irregularities , as they are damaging to everyone involved .
Seen in this perspective , this initiative should also be viewed as positive , and as an initiative intended to further the Middle East peace process .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is true that the present trade agreement between Israel and the EC is ambiguous .
It is also very difficult to establish the origin of the products in question .
I can therefore only concur that it is desirable for some light to be shed on the matter soon .
There are , nonetheless , a number of other important factors which we need to take into consideration .
Indeed , we are all agreed that the recent revival of the peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered .
Israel and the Palestinians are currently involved in intense negotiations concerning their future borders .
Any attempt by anyone , including by any third party , to define - let alone impose - the territorial area to be adopted for trading purposes is therefore premature .
In my opinion , it seems preferable to await the findings of the tripartite working group , to be convened on the initiative of Israel , the European Commission and also the Palestinians for the purpose of examining the origin rules .
I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view .
Hopefully , this working party will find a temporary solution to the problem within the existing legal framework without jeopardising the peace process .
For this peace process deserves absolute priority , and we in the European Community and in Europe should not put any obstacle whatsoever in the way of this process .
There seems to be remarkable consensus in the House today but I would like to make a few points .
Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint .
We are major donors but we have , unfortunately been marginalised in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively , as many speakers have said today , just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland .
We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories , indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement .
Borders are being shut down , sometimes arbitrarily , and sometimes following a terrorist attack .
On one of my many visits to the area , I have seen flowers and strawberries rotting , lying in the streets of Gaza and being eaten by the donkeys while their Palestinian producers look on helplessly in despair .
But it is not just an issue of closed borders .
Goods do flow freely from these territories , goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories .
We have an international agreement and it is being transgressed .
It is our responsibility to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected and upheld by all .
Under the circumstances , when Israel does not clearly discharge its duty to apply the origin rules and the territorial clause of the agreement as it should , the Commission is encouraging Member States to resort to the import verification procedures which can be dilatory and evasive .
Israeli customs can be given a very long time , up to ten months , to reply to any queries and the import verification procedure can be totally unproductive .
We should be requiring deposits on all goods imported from Israel until we are able to ensure that Israel will stop abusing the agreement .
I have a couple of questions , Commissioner .
Has the Commission received from any Member States ' customs services documents certified by Israeli customs that represent specific settlement locations in the occupied territories falling within the scope of the agreement ?
Has it directly asked the Israeli officials responsible whether its customs service applies the territorial clause so as to exclude the occupied territories from the agreement and has it determined that Israel correctly understands and interprets that territorial clause ?
And is the Commission aware whether they apply that territorial clause correctly or not ?
Finally , the Commission has already stated that action to uphold international agreements with the EU , and I am quoting , " does not represent a sanction against Israel but demands correct implementation of existing agreements freely entered into by the parties " .
In short , Commissioner , this is not an issue which should be treated as a matter for peace-process-related political debate .
It is , in fact , an international agreement and a trade agreement .
Could I just finally express my great hopes for the peace process in that area - a part of the world that so desperately needs it - so that it can re-group and re-form and help its millions of under-privileged and poverty-stricken citizens .
Mr President , it is universally recognised that rules must be observed .
It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules .
Everyone understands that there is concern about this today , but I would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable .
Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment .
Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel .
And because the Commission ' s investigation is not , and must not be perceived as , an indictment , I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach .
Firstly , anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel .
The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority .
Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine , including joint ventures , Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters .
Secondly , nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined .
The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers .
Any attempt on the part of the European Union to impose its own idea of the territorial limits of the State of Israel would be , at the very least , lacking in tact and detrimental to these talks and to the idea of the role which we feel Europe should have in this region .
I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter , firstly because this is not a simple issue .
It is complicated ; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from .
No less so in the Middle East because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between Israel and Palestinians , where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the Palestinian area and in the State of Israel and these developments are good things , they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the Middle East , then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement .
Therefore , because it is not an easy and simple issue , we have to be cautious and we have to be careful .
The second reason why the Commission is right to proceed in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a part in the area in securing peace then it must be seen to be fair and evenhanded .
It would not be fair and evenhanded to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that it is meeting determine what the situation is , both in terms of the area of the State of Israel relating to the trade agreement and , as I say , in relation to the goods and where they come from at the same time .
There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported .
We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement .
You have a government in Israel which wants peace and wants to secure peace and if you proceed in a rash and rapid way then you could jeopardise the success of that peace agreement .
You cannot cherrypick in negotiations , this is part of an overall settlement of some extremely complicated issues and I think the Commission is absolutely right to let these things flow through carefully in the hope that by doing so we can secure what all of us want and that is a secure and just and durable peace in the Middle East .
Mr President , it is , of course , unacceptable for breaches of our trade agreement with Israel to be concealed or tolerated .
By giving de facto preferential treatment to products from the occupied settlements under the trade agreement with Israel , the EU is contravening two important principles of international law .
It is contravening both the fourth Geneva Convention from 1949 and international norms in force concerning the unilateral incorporation of occupied territories .
Because the world ' s and the EU ' s respect for these two international principles forms the basis for the peace process which has been instituted , violations of these principles undermine the very basis of the peace process .
The EU must now choose between basing its relations with Israel and Palestine on the standards of international law , thereby strengthening the basis of the peace process , and showing disdain for international law .
The choice ought to be simple .
International law prescribes that trade agreements should be established with countries and regions which we recognise and not with disputed territories .
Customs duties must be claimed back , and the EU ' s Member States and Israel must respect the trade agreement ' s rules concerning strict monitoring of the way in which products are labelled to show their country of origin .
The Commission must guarantee that these things will be done .
Commissioner Vitorino ' s contribution offered some hope that they would be .
The peace process in the Middle East must be given a chance .
It can only be founded upon international law .
It is the EU ' s responsibility to contribute to this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank all of you who have taken part in this debate for the excellent , valuable contributions you have made , as we are addressing an issue which is undoubtedly very sensitive politically speaking .
If the Commission is able to draw any conclusions from this debate , I would say that it seems to us that in broad terms Parliament is looking favourably on the strategy that the Commission has followed to address this issue . It is true that this strategy may be cautious , but it is also quite unambiguous .
The Commission is aware of how politically sensitive this subject is and does not doubt for a minute that progress towards finding real solutions for the proper application of this trade agreement is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process .
The Commission is also aware that the political importance attributed to the peace process by the European Union is reflected in Parliament and in the Commission , as has been said here by various Members and is a result of the recent visit to the region by President Nicole Fontaine as well as President Romano Prodi ' s very recent visit last week .
We are therefore fully aware of the fact that we are at a very delicate stage in the peace process , which must not be endangered by positions that would result from blindly applying legal rules , because applying the law requires that we should endeavour to find a solution on which all parties can agree .
The truth of the situation is that the approach adopted by the Commission on this subject is to seek to obtain the support and agreement of all parties involved in the process .
In response to various Members ' questions , I therefore think that the proposal put forward by the Israeli authorities , which is to set up a tripartite working group to consider the implications of this transition period in applying the trade agreement , which has already been accepted by the Palestinian authorities , deserves not only our acceptance , but also a statement of our confidence that through this kind of dialogue , through this kind of mutual vigilance over the correct application of the trade agreement , we will be able to achieve positive results in the interests of the population of the region .
And what the population of the region is interested in , above all , is peace , and their own economic prosperity .
Lastly , I would like to say that we feel this approach remains true to the principles and the values of the agreement , which we feel is sufficiently clear in legal terms . We are also convinced that we are taking positive steps to create an atmosphere of mutual trust which is always the best basis on which to build peace , because the Middle East has no alternative but to achieve peaceful coexistence between all of the peoples living there .
Commissioner , I recognise the delicacy of the issue at the moment but I did ask you a couple of specific questions .
I recognise that you are probably not in a position to answer them this morning , but I hope very much that you will send me answers when you have them , as soon as possible please , relating to the actual , technical implementation of the agreements in relation to goods .
Thank you very much , Mrs Banotti .
The debate is closed .

VOTE
Mr President , in my view , the position is very clear following the debate we had yesterday with Commissioner Diamantopoulou and the President-in-Office of the Council , and Parliament should vote on the original text .
Hence we withdraw our signature to Amendment No 4 .
Thank you very much .

- Attwooll report ( A5-0038 / 2000 )
We know that the Commission is going to reform the common fisheries policy shortly .
This proposal for a Council Regulation is the first in a series which will make it possible to draw up this reform .
The collection and management of the fisheries data is needed to conduct the common fisheries policy .
This data must be reliable , drawn up independently and accepted by all the operators in the industry , politicians and those individuals responsible for the application of this CFP .
The text of the proposal for a Regulation has been amended quite extensively in the Committee on Fisheries .
All the members of our Group voted in favour of these amendments , both in committee and in Parliament .
Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably .
Specifically , the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use .
Scientists must process this data and pass it on to the relevant political decision-making authorities .
It is , however , crucial for the data collection method to be carried out in a scientifically justified manner .
Amendment No 2 amends the initial Commission proposal .
What the Commission proposal suggests is drawing up extremely detailed studies of individual vessels and individual businesses .
In addition to the extremely high cost of such a proposal , the cumbersome nature of its management may cause some administrations to use its complexities as a pretext not to provide the information in due time and may give rise to a certain feeling of suspicion among the people working in the sector if they have onerous additional bureaucratic constraints foisted upon them in this way .
Regarding the second part of this amendment , it is important that job losses in the industry are counted and identified much more clearly .
Let us not forget that in the administration of a common fisheries policy the statistical analysis used must include the social aspect .
Amendment No 3 makes it possible to add an important aspect : the collection of environmental data .
The value of this can be gauged from the particularly serious effects caused by failing to take data of this type into account , for example , in the case of the decision on the prohibition of drift gillnets , which is totally unjustifiable from the environmental standpoint , since they are one of the most selective types of fishing gear that exist .
If this environmental dimension were not incorporated into the management of data , then the Commission would be able unilaterally , just as it pleases , to prohibit the use of any particular type of fishing gear .
Amendment No 4 specifies the obligation upon scientists to process all the data and pass it on to the relevant authorities , including national and regional authorities , in order to contribute to the decision-making process .
Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal .
Effectively , the information requested from the authorities must be reasonable in order to allow an operational overview of fishing activities without compromising essential rights to confidentiality , for example , in fiscal matters , where the Community has no jurisdiction .
Amendment No 6 is intended to tighten up the Commission ' s participation in the inspection procedure .
It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results .
Finally , Amendment No 7 requires the Commission to produce a report by the end of the year 2001 .
In fact , because the reform of the common fisheries policy is scheduled for 2002 , it is essential that all the political participants should be given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the information which will form the basis of the Commission proposal .
Hudghton report ( A5-0036 / 2000 )
- ( FR ) The amendment to the directive as presented by the Commission is an important one since it deals with a specific disease , i.e. infectious salmon anaemia , a contagious viral disease .
It is a water-borne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood , faecal matter , mucus , etc .
There is no scientific proof of the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through roe .
It is , however , recognised that other species such as trout , eels or herring , may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it .
The disease was detected in Norway in 1984 and also in Canada ( 1996 ) .
The virus does not survive at a temperature of more than 26º C , and is therefore not dangerous to humans .
The disease chiefly affects the Scottish salmon industry .
It was detected in this region in May 1998 .
Today , 240 salmon farms are affected by ISA .
It is therefore essential to contain this disease and prevent it spreading to all the aquacultural establishments in the various Member Sates of the European Union .
The Council proposal envisages setting up a system for the gradual elimination of fish affected by the disease and also a vaccination plan .
We can only declare ourselves in favour of the proposed plan for the gradual elimination of affected fish .
The fish farms concerned must be assisted in ' cleaning up ' the infected site and preventing the disease from spreading through the commercial transport of live fish .
As regards vaccination , we should remember that the initial directive prohibited the use of vaccines against ISA .
The Commission ' s new proposal would authorise the use of vaccines , but it is important to point out that so far , no vaccine has actually been found .
The usefulness of this proposal is limited , to say the least , certainly in the short term .
Canada does have a vaccine with a 76 % success rate .
Since the Canadian strain differs from the European strain , this vaccine cannot be used in its present state , but may be used as the starting point for the development of a vaccine against the European strain .
It is therefore crucial for the Commission to earmark sufficient funding to support the development of an effective vaccine against the European strain of ISA .
Resolution on women in decision making ( B5-0180 / 2000 )
My Group abstained in the resolution on women in decision making , much to our regret .
But even greater is our regret that we still need such resolutions .
In 1994 , the Green Group was the first group in this Parliament to have a majority of women in it , the Greens were the first group to have a woman secretary-general in Dominique Voinet , now the French Environment Minister , and the German Greens were the first political party to operate gender parity in order to redress the overall under-representation of women in political institutions .
This lead has since been followed by a number of parties and it cannot be said that the electorate have risen in protest to condemn such parties for their actions .
Nor have the electorate felt themselves manipulated by such quotas .
The resolution makes clear there is a need for a proportional system that gives form to women ' s representation and that all political parties must take action .
We look forward to that .
We have sympathy with those who argue that people should be selected on their merits ; they should be .
Our culture should allow for a balance between the sexes and people should be able to develop their talents wherever they lie , but our culture and values at the moment do not reflect that belief .
Prejudice and stereotyping are widespread and is it any wonder that people who come from minority groups whether black , gay , physically handicapped or whatever face discrimination and unfair treatment when a majority group , women , also face such discrimination .
That is why our Group supports positive action and only when women are fairly represented in positions of decision making will men also be fairly represented .
We might also then develop a culture where your paid and unpaid work , your pay packet , your parental leave and your pension are not determined by your sex .
As International Women ' s Day rapidly approaches , I would like to reiterate my support for the action undertaken within the Institutions and the Member States with a view to promoting women ' s access to positions of responsibility , particularly in politics .
That is why I shall most decidedly be voting in favour of the text of this resolution which urges us to take more proactive measures to combat the residual discrimination preventing women occupying their rightful place in our society !
Since 1995 , promoting women in the decision-making process has been one of the priority areas of the European Union action programme for equal opportunities , and is included among the commitments reiterated both by the Union institutions and by the Member States when they discuss equality between men and women .
Nonetheless , even though progress has been made in recent years thanks to strategies such as mainstreaming and complementary schemes such as positive action , they are still too few in number to be satisfactory .
Under-representation of women in politics , for example , continues to be the norm .
The importance of enabling greater numbers of women to become involved in politics is , however , recognised .
Only women are in a position to come up with policies likely to change structures which have been developed by men for men .
For , whether in politics or in the labour market , structural discrimination is the main problem facing women .
It is thus up to the European political parties to make themselves more accessible to women .
Moreover , Article 191 of the Treaty ( ex Article 138a ) stresses , political parties are , I quote , " important as a factor for integration within the Union " .
This article goes on to state that " they contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union " .
A condition of this type may have no legal value , but it is nonetheless of great symbolic value .
It gives political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe .
This may , for example , involve implementing positive action and promoting parity within our political parties .
In the 1999 European elections some parties did put forward lists with men and women equally represented .
This is an example of good practice which should be applied more widely .
I do not know if there is some cause-and-effect at work here , but the fact is that the proportion of female Members in the European Parliament went from 25.7 % in 1994 to 29.9 % in 1999 .
Moreover , this Parliament has had a woman president since the 1999 elections .
I shall conclude by repeating the conclusions of the conference organised by the Commission in April 1999 entitled " Women and men in power " .
Equality between men and women is not a problem that affects women alone , but one that affects our entire society !
- Some progress has been made recently in increasing the number of women present in decision-making bodies around the Union .
In our own Institution , 30 % of elected representatives are now women , including the President of the European Parliament itself .
Finland too has just elected a female President .
On average , one quarter of Member State governments are composed of women and a little over one fifth of their parliaments .
This is still far from satisfactory , especially given that the figures vary enormously between Member States where the Nordic countries experience a much higher female representation in positions of responsibility and decision making .
This situation has more to do with attitude and respect for the quality and abilities of women ' s contributions to society than fixed quotas .
My Group does not favour the use of quotas in general since , in the long run , they can be counterproductive and even undermine the cause they aim to support .
Nevertheless , we recognise that the experience in all Member Sates is not the same and some recourse to such measures may be justified , as a temporary remedy , to rebalance female representation where women are grossly under-represented .
We were able to support the resolution on women in decision making , adopted with a view to commemorating International Women ' s Day on 8 March , which has incorporated ten Liberal Group amendments and softened the reference to quotas in line with the approach outlined above .
- ( FR ) Women suffer increasingly from inequality since they are the victims of the sexist discrimination which can take an overt form ( violence , rape , sexual harassment , domestic violence , etc . ) but also a more insidious one .
This oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men ' s work more than women ' s .
Wages are not equal , women ' s work is still perceived as ' stop-gap ' work and , more generally , female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men .
What is more , women bear the main responsibility for family matters .
Women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men .
Mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace .
States must develop a public service offering childcare for working mothers .
Finally , in order to enable everyone , men and women , to become involved in public life , working hours must be drastically reduced .
We need real equality between men and women in political , economic and social life .
We are opposed to the idea that the biological differences between men and women should give rise to two different world views and two different value systems .
Women have the right to be involved in the decision-making process as ' individuals ' and not as token females .
- I , together with my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation , am totally committed to the need to have more women playing a full and active part in public life .
We share in all expressions of regret that there remains inequality and gender discrimination and especially under-representation of women in politics .
However , we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be countered with another form of discrimination , namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places .
I feel this especially keenly as only on Tuesday evening of this week my 27-year-old daughter , Caroline , was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for the Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom .
She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers .
We should not adopt a position that in any way detracts from the position of the increasing number of women who are demonstrating that without fear or favour they can earn their place in public life .
For this reason members of my delegation have supported much of the resolution but we registered our opposition to those calls for positive discrimination in favour of women , which we think is the wrong way to make progress , is itself demeaning to women and distorts the democratic process and we have therefore abstained in the final vote .
Katiforis report ( A5-0041 / 2000 )
Mr President , I voted for the Katiforis report on the European Union economy in 1999 to toe the group line , and also because it reveals an extremely serious deficiency which I hope it will contribute to eliminating during the next few years .
However , the report does not fully explain , or rather it does not explain at all , that the economies of the States of the Union also and , above all , depend on the way in which pension contributions paid by workers are used .
The report does not mention the fact - although this will have to be specified in the future - that over the last forty years , the governments of all the Member States have squandered and dissipated the capital entrusted to them by workers for their pensions .
And so we now have no resources left to pay pensions .
We need a completely different system .
These leaders must resign . They do not deserve the loyalty of the elderly of today , nor the young people of today , nor the elderly of 2100 , 2200 and so forth .
- ( FR ) I shall begin , first of all , by warmly congratulating Mr Katiforis on the audacity of his proposals !
I shall continue by deploring the excessively cautious approach of the right wing in the European Parliament which , by adopting a whole raft of amendments , has robbed my colleague ' s work of its substance !
This report , let me remind you , is based on the Commission ' s annual economic report for 1999 , the first of these to be published under the euro system , which , consequently , is more concerned with the single European economy than with a series of national economies .
The European Parliament had the option to take this opportunity to put forward imaginative and ' proactive ' proposals , according to the rapporteur ' s own description , with a view to giving European Union economic activities a new orientation .
One observation is unavoidable : Europe has unparalleled potential for economic and social progress which , for reasons that still partly escape us , remains largely unexploited , hence the highly interesting suggestions made in the initial report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to regenerate economic activity by setting ambitious goals ( an employment rate of 75 % , an upturn in growth , etc . ) and by setting aside sufficient resources to achieve this .
The initial proposals suggested that the Council in particular should bring in measures with a view to ensuring full employment which would still be consistent with price stability and the budgetary balance of the entire economic cycle .
It is not in fact a matter , as some would have us believe , of challenging the policy of stability we adopted some years ago .
Some measures , particularly on tax , must be adopted to encourage private and public investment .
We must get the programme of Trans-European Networks , as proposed in 1994 , back on track , we must initiate a major research and development programme in order to ensure that investments necessarily have an innovative content .
Why do we think that investment should not be used as an instrument for managing demand but should rather be practised for its own sake ?
We must encourage better management of working time and the dissemination of policies of good practice within Member States in order to increase levels of employability , particularly among the most disadvantaged sectors of the working population .
Some measures such as retraining , in the form of lifelong training , seem particularly relevant .
These must be an integral part of the on-going institutional transformation which must support the transition to a knowledge-based economy .
A proposal of this type brings us back into line with the thinking adopted for the Special Summit on employment which is to take place in Lisbon in March .
All of these measures , which are too proactive in the eyes of some of those on the right , have , of course , been brushed aside .
I must condemn this !
An amendment referring to taxation on speculative capital transfers also suffered the same fate .
. ( PT ) We regret the fact that the first draft report presented by the rapporteur was rejected in committee , as it had some positive aspects to it , specifically its references to the need to increase public investment and investment in job creation in order to achieve 75 % employment .
We have therefore voted against the report in its present form , as all the amendments we tabled were rejected .
I would like to highlight the following :
the importance of public investment for sustained economic growth based on economic recovery , by stimulating internal demand and concentrating public investment in areas which would have a positive effect on the economy in general , such as building and maintaining infrastructures , urban renewal , vocational training , education and health ;
promotion of demand within the Community , through greater public investment and salary increases relating to increased productivity , as a means of achieving greater economic growth , which is essential if we are to achieve our objective of full employment ;
the creation of support mechanisms for SME associations as a way of improving the competitiveness of SMEs and their level of organisation , as they can provide support services to association members , such as centralised credit , information and legal support services .
- ( FR ) Our position is determined by the nature of our project for Europe .
We are in favour of a Europe which gives absolute priority to satisfying the needs of all men and women , particularly the unemployed , in such a way that they enjoy a decent existence ; the reduction of working hours combined with mandatory recruitment , without flexibility ; wage increases in line with productivity ; fiscal reform harmonising upwards the taxation of unearned income ; a Tobin tax to discourage financial speculation and , finally , the implementation of a planned energy saving programme .
Such a policy should bring the overcautious monetarism of the ECB into perspective and should break with the neo-liberal principles of privatisation and undermining social protection .
The resolution turns its back on such an approach .
Quite the contrary , it awards full marks to the policy of stabilisation which has created only unemployment and poverty and which , through its obsession with monetarism , is in danger of stifling rather than supporting the current upturn in the economy .
The free-marketeering Right ' s rejection of the proposed amendments leads us , therefore , to vote against the resolution .
- ( SV ) We have chosen to abstain in the vote on Amendment 4 to the Katiforis report on the EU Economy ( 1999 ) .
Our basic attitude is that competition between different national tax systems is not always a bad thing and that the Member States should , as far as possible , retain their right of decision making in this area .
At national level , we are exceptionally keen that taxes on business and labour should be reduced towards the levels which prevail in our competitors ' countries , but an issue such as that should be decided by the Swedish Parliament and not by the European Parliament .
Through a situation in which different countries seek different solutions concerning tax and welfare policy , the opportunity is provided to adapt policy to the characteristic features of the individual nations and to test out different forms of social security systems .
Tax harmonisation at European level should only take place in exceptional cases , for example in the cases of certain environmental taxes and taxes on capital .
Even if we agree that a certain degree of tax harmonisation is necessary if the internal market is to function properly , Amendment No 4 is altogether too far-reaching and undifferentiated when it comes to this issue .
Joint resolution on the shipwreck of the ( RC B5-0181 / 2000 )
Mr President , we voted in favour of the resolution on the wreck of the Erika out of solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster .
We do , however , deplore the indecisive nature of the resolution .
Confining oneself to deploring the disaster and expressing sympathy for its victims without applying some restraining measures in order to oblige Total to make good all the direct and indirect consequences of the pollution for which it is entirely responsible is tantamount to doing nothing .
It is disgusting to see Total leaving the reparation of the damage it caused to volunteers and local authorities .
It is equally disgusting to see the State releasing funds , inadequate funds moreover , which represent nothing more than a backdoor subsidy to this firm and its criminal dealings .
Confining oneself to discussing merely the issue of flags of convenience is dodging the main issue .
Whatever the flag of convenience used by Total , the oil company responsible is widely known and represented in all the countries of the European Union and the authorities concerned could , if they were so inclined , seize all of its assets until the company makes payment .
We feel we must condemn , above all , this economy in which , in order to make extra profits , a firm can ruin a region with pollution in the same way that it can ruin a region by closing factories .
Mr President , partly on behalf of the Breton partner of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , the Union Democratique Brétonne ( UDB ) , I am asking for an effective policy to prevent further disasters of the kind involving the Erika .
Legislation and controls should not only be tightened up but also applied to the letter .
It was made painfully clear that a number of players need to be removed from the pitch in order to ensure that the Erika was the last unseaworthy ship to pollute the Breton coast .
This is the seventh time that Brittany is having to deal with an oil slick since the Torrey Canyon shipwreck .
No other region in the world has had to pay such a high price for the transport of polluting or dangerous substances by sea .
Together with our friends from the UDB , I would argue in favour of two important guidelines relating to the complete overhaul of the world ' s merchant navy and the protection of the Breton coast ( proposals also to be found in the draft resolution which has just been approved ) .
At EU level we would like to see one single piece of legislation drawn up for shipping , encompassing all its technical , commercial , social and environmental aspects .
Without exception , the risky practices of flags of convenience must be banned in the ports and waters of the fifteen Member States and thirteen applicant States .
Secondly , together with the UDB , we would argue in favour of establishing coastguard services and appointing maritime inspectors to work under the direct supervision of the relevant shipping areas and monitor the strict observance of European legislation .
The draft resolution which we have approved contains provisions to this effect , and our Group has therefore given it its full backing .
- ( FR ) I welcome the adoption by a virtually unanimous vote of the House of the resolution on the effects of the oil slick caused by the Erika . Our Group made a great contribution to drafting this resolution .
It takes far better account than our previous resolution of the extent of the disaster , which every day seems to get far worse than anticipated on first analysis and is becoming more exacting , clearer and more urgent .
At this stage it is still difficult to assess the total damage caused to all the fishing , fish farming and aquaculture sectors .
We do already know , however , that it will be extensive .
Every day , further pollution increases the toll .
The degradation does not affect just business turnover but also valuable parts of our heritage .
The effect upon the brand image of seafood products is hard to calculate today .
It is also essential to include the damage suffered by businesses both upstream and downstream ( the fish trade , service providers , tourism , etc . ) and the overall costs incurred by the authorities in eliminating pollution and restoring the reputation of the tourist industry .
Fishing and tourism , as the two chief resources in most of the regions on our Atlantic coastline , have therefore both been hard hit .
Hence the need to clearly stipulate , as our resolution does , the principle of ' polluter cleans ' and the principle of ' polluter pays ' .
It is in fact the job of the polluters to pay the costs for cleaning the areas suffering as a result of their actions , and for the restoration of the ecological balance damaged by their actions .
Regarding the compensation system , the citizens are anxious because FIPOL ' s initial compensation payments to victims have been limited to 25 % .
This is just scandalous .
Quite obviously all victims should receive 100 % compensation .
It would be quite unthinkable to insist that victims should bear any part of the costs of the damages they have suffered due to the incompetence of a polluter .
Our resolution further welcomes the initiatives taken by a number of local authorities , such as the French department of Vendée , to draw up a precise assessment of the state of the coast prior to the arrival of the first waves of the oil slick .
This procedure should be adopted as a model , since it will make it possible to expedite the compensation of victims , be they private individuals or public authorities .
Finally , our resolution clearly stipulates that it is absolutely essential , in matters of maritime safety , to break out of this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility , this pernicious system of mutual paralysis wherein States dump responsibility onto the Union , and the Union dumps it on the States , and in the end , the polluters are the only winners .
Everyone must play their own part .
The Commission , which , for once , has not followed the lead of the Americans even though it might have been beneficial in this case , should establish a basis for maritime safety at the earliest possible opportunity .
This basis must include minimum conditions for access to Community waters and ports with regard to the age and characteristics of vessels ; a general principle of environmental responsibility making it possible to determine the liability of the various operators , and particularly that of the charterer , and to impose heavy penalties .
The Commission should ensure the coordination of information . It should not be afraid to confront the lax attitude of some major ports or major shipowners , and should make the issue of flags of convenience a central concern in the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus .
Let me remind you that the Erika was registered in Valletta .
All the same , States must clearly not shift their own essential responsibility onto the Union : the safety of all concerned is conditional upon the standards and effectiveness of inspection by the port State ( and the resources made available for this ) .
We must , and shall , remain particularly vigilant in the months to come in order to ensure that the victims who bear none of the responsibility whatsoever for this disaster receive compensation in full from the polluter , and to ensure that this time we do in fact learn the lessons from the oil slick in terms of maritime safety , so that polluters are deterred once and for all from gambling with the lives of our coastal populations .
The most effective form of prevention is to ensure that any potential polluter is made liable to extremely heavy financial penalties .
Katiforis report ( A5-0017 / 2000 )
We agree that the fishing industry has the most to gain from promoting respect for the marine environment .
We must nevertheless bear in mind that there are many factors that contribute to damaging marine areas , such as contamination and pollution by oil tankers and other maritime transport , industrial activity , the pressure of human activity on coastal waters and , of course , uncontrolled fishing activity .
It is worth emphasising , however , that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing activity can be combined with sustainable development that does not threaten the marine environment .
We feel that it is possible to create a fisheries management policy based on conserving the marine environment which is compatible with the interests of fishing communities .
But in order for this to happen , we must specifically take account of the fact that there is a correlation between income from fishing and an increase in fishing effort .
It is therefore necessary to adopt measures under the common fisheries policy and to provide appropriate financial resources to guarantee the income of those who depend entirely on fishing for their livelihood , such as fishermen , particularly at times when fishing activity is suspended or reduced .
Hence the importance of our amendments , which sought to achieve this .
- ( FR ) The Commission communication lists a series of objectives and proposals reporting the need to continue the efforts undertaken in the field of inspection and supervision , to adopt new technical measures under the heading of the selectivity of fishing techniques , monitoring the application of legislation in force , etc .
In its communication , however , at the same time the Commission specifies that it is not in a position to ensure that this legislation is complied with .
The fact is that there is no lack of existing measures and appropriate means .
The Commission has a whole arsenal of restrictive conditions , measures and decisions ( at both international and Community level ) already in force in the fisheries and marine environment protection sectors .
Effectiveness and excessive regulation are not compatible .
It should be remembered that people working in maritime sectors are willing to apply Community legislation on condition that it is applied equitably in all the Member States , that it is both acceptable and applicable in technical terms , and has a proper scientific foundation .
I find it unacceptable that one of the officials of the European Commission in the Committee on Fisheries should have dared to state in public that the financial resources awarded by the Commission to some scientific bodies should give it the right to have control over their conclusions .
This is an extremely serious abuse : obviously the Commission must not assume any right whatsoever to direct the scientists ' conclusions in order to be able to apply the policy it deems suitable , taking only its own interests into account .
As regards reducing the pressure exerted by fishing upon resources , it is important to emphasise the international nature of this obligation .
What real point would there be in reducing our European fishing fleet if , at the same time , third countries were going to continue to deplete fisheries resources ?
Moreover , it must be observed that the development of the globalisation of trade has the effect of considerably reducing the effectiveness of inspection and supervision of fishing activities .
Transhipment has become common practice and frequently fish products from one Member State which cannot be sold within the Union due to exceeding the TAC are sold as imported products or as originating from another Member State .
The latter o
