Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 16 January 2003 .
Madam President , I should like to know whether a dress code has been introduced here in Parliament .
I am thinking of something that happened yesterday during a hearing concerning the Takeover Directive .
The Chairman of the hearing , Mr Gargani , asked the officers to ensure that all the men put jackets on out of respect for the experts present , as he put it .
Since my assistant had no jacket or tie on , he was asked to leave the hearing and was therefore unable to do his work , a fact I am very unhappy about .
I should like to know if there is a new practice in Parliament .
For your information , I can point out that I am wearing neither a tie , shirt nor jacket .
As a matter of fact , I am wearing jeans , so I would ask you : do I have permission to be here as an MEP ?
Mr Blak , I will make inquiries into that matter .
I note your upset with regard to your assistant .
Regarding the balance , you are welcome to be here , but after the sitting I would be happy to recommend you a good tailor .
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in Iraq .
( Members on the centre and left held up placards reading ' No to war ' and ' Yes to old Europe ' )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as always , it is a great honour for me to take part in a sitting of the European Parliament .
But although it is always a pleasure , I must tell you that today is also a moment of great concern for me .
( The President cut off the speaker . )
Mr Solana , I apologise for interrupting your introduction .
Colleagues , I think you have made your point .
I would appreciate it if you would put down your placards so that we can proceed with the debate .
( Applause from the right )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I was saying that I am always happy to appear before you , but today I am doing so at a time when I am extremely worried .
The international situation is not good and the time has come for us to hold a debate within this institution to consider how the most burning issues currently on the international scene can be viewed , and if possible resolved , from a European perspective .
I have seen the placards that some Members of this Parliament have displayed very clearly , and I would like to say that unfortunately , or fortunately in other respects , I am talking to you from the point of view of an old Europe , because of my age , but also because of my affection for everything which is represented by the Europe of yesterday , the Europe of today and the Europe of tomorrow .
Mr President , do not imagine that I am so old , I am going to carry on working and pestering people for a few more years .
( Applause )
Mr President , in the short time available to me this afternoon , if the honourable Members will allow me , I would like to discuss four or five points which I believe are essential to a global understanding of the international situation .
The first is undoubtedly Iraq .
But I would also like to take this opportunity to debate with you , if only very briefly , the situation in the Middle East on such an important day as this , the day after the elections in Israel .
I also believe it would be a mistake not to say a few words about North Korea , given the dramatic situation at the moment , and I will end with a very brief comment on the operations the European Union is beginning to plan for the deployment of forces in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
I will begin with the first point : the situation in Iraq .
As you know , ladies and gentlemen , the General Affairs Council is taking place this week and next week and they are going to be extremely important weeks in terms of finding a solution to the Iraq crisis .
On Monday morning , for the first time , there was a concertation procedure , in accordance with Article 19 of the EU Treaty , between the Presidency , the troika and the members of the European Union sitting on the United Nations Security Council here in Brussels at ministerial level .
This is the first time that anything of this nature has taken place ; there had been many concertation meetings in New York , but there had never been a meeting here in Brussels at ministerial level of the two permanent members and the two non-permanent members of the Security Council together with the Presidency , Commissioner Patten and myself .
I would like to say very briefly that in the meeting there was general consensus at least on four essential points which the European Union wishes to defend in all fora .
I will run through the four points , although the honourable Members know them very well .
Firstly : we all have an interest in Iraq getting rid of weapons of mass destruction and this is something that all Europeans should agree on .
One of the most serious problems we are going to face during this century is unquestionably the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
And we Europeans cannot ignore this problem , a serious problem for which a solution must be found .
Therefore , to try , by every means possible , and in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council , to ensure that Baghdad gets rid of all weapons of mass destruction must be a priority for the European Union .
The second important point is Iraq 's responsibility to cooperate actively with the inspectors .
You have good knowledge of the report which Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei presented the other day to the Security Council , and you saw them directly , because the President of the European Parliament had the opportunity to speak with the inspection chiefs by means of a videoconference with New York .
I also had the opportunity to speak with them subsequently , and I will therefore not insist on this since I am sure that the Presidency has informed Parliament in a clear manner .
The third point , which I believe is essential to point out , is that we must give all the necessary support to the inspectors .
The inspectors are the eyes and ears of the international community .
If they are capable of convincing the Security Council of the situation , I am sure that the Security Council will also convince public opinion of the current situation in Baghdad .
Therefore , whatever the implicit or explicit requests - and I insist , implicit or explicit - of the inspectors to the members of the Security Council , I believe Europe should help them .
And there are essentially three types of suggestions or requests that the inspectors could make to us , firstly : that they require more resources , more resources than they currently have , more inspectors and more logistical resources ; secondly : they may need more time ; and thirdly : they may need more information or more intelligence .
I believe that the international community should respond positively to these three requests from the inspectors .
In other words , they should be offered resources , time and intelligence .
And the fourth point , which I believe is absolutely essential and which must be defended by the Europeans , is that the whole of this process relating to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and more specifically the issue of Iraq , must remain within the framework of the United Nations Security Council .
It must be carried out within the framework of the United Nations , which is the institution which must provide the legitimacy for any action in relation to this issue .
( Applause )
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr President , you are well aware of the differing positions expressed by various Members of the European Union , but you also know that there are not just the opinions of the leaders in the European Union , but we also have clear and convincing surveys of the thoughts of the European citizens .
I believe that the European citizens are clear about two things : one , that they do not want war ; and the other , that they do not want dictators in the world .
And we must make the two things compatible in the eyes of the population , of the citizens of Europe .
How to make preventing armed conflicts and preventing the existence of dictators compatible is the great challenge facing the international community .
Our intention as Europeans must be to ensure that Resolution 1441 , which was unanimously approved by the United Nations Security Council and which was approved unanimously by the Arab League two days later , should become a reality and that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi regime can disarm without the need for military force .
Therefore , the countries of the European Union and all of us who serve the European Union will work with all our might , day and night , to try to prevent a conflict and to ensure that Saddam Hussein abandons weapons of mass destruction without our turning to military force .
As you know , a debate began today in the Security Council on the basis of the report produced by the inspection chiefs 48 hours ago .
Let us wait and see how that debate develops before taking a position on it .
As you are aware , yesterday the President of the United States made an important speech .
I would like to welcome an expression , a phrase , an idea , which was suggested in this speech , which is the idea , the suggestion or the commitment that the Secretary of State , Mr Colin Powell , would appear before the United Nations Security Council to explain the information and intelligence in existence in those countries which have privileged information or privileged intelligence .
I believe and I insist that the centre of gravity of this process must continue to be the United Nations Security Council and I therefore believe it very appropriate that the information that certain countries currently have should be debated within it and that , if possible , that information should also be passed on to the inspectors .
You also know that there will be other consultations in the coming days ?
( Applause )
? and let us hope that the inspectors can have more time to continue their work and , if possible , as I said before , to complete their mandate in accordance with Resolution 1441 .
Ladies and gentlemen , Europe is involved in this process : four Members of the European Union are on the Security Council , one candidate for membership of the European Union is on the Security Council and I am sure that the countries making up that Council will make every possible effort so that what we are saying here becomes reality in the coming days .
Since you have information from the President of Parliament on the conversation yesterday with Dr Blix , I will not say anything about the comments made and I will move on briefly to the second point I wanted to discuss with you , ladies and gentlemen , which is the issue of the Middle East .
Yesterday elections took place in Israel , and I believe we must learn at least three important lessons from these elections .
Firstly , the low turn-out .
It is surprising - or at least it surprises me - that in view of the situation we are facing in the Middle East electoral turn-out should be so low .
It is the lowest turn-out since the 1967 elections . That is the first point to stress .
The second point to stress is the enormous , and very significant , victory of Prime Minister Sharon .
I would like , on behalf of all of us , to congratulate him on his victory and the victory of his party .
Sharon 's victory is like none other of his previous victories . And I believe we should say to Prime Minister Sharon , on behalf of the European Union , that at this time when he has enormous opportunities to form a coalition government , that he should form a coalition government that concentrates on resolving the problem of the war and finding permanent peace in the Middle East .
That is the demand that with respect I believe we should make of him since it has been demonstrated that a huge number of Israelis have voted for him .
The third issue we should highlight and on which we must draw conclusions is the heavy defeat of the Labour Party and the defeat of the Meretz Party .
The two great parties , which have historically defended peace , which have been the centre of gravity in terms of peace , have suffered damage .
We must analyse why this situation has come about .
It will primarily be their job to do this .
We have seen that the Secretary-General of the Meretz Party has tendered his resignation .
But , in any event , from a European point of view we must maintain our policy and our policy is still the one contained in the work of the Quartet and the one contained in the road map which was approved in Washington not long ago .
Once there is a government in Israel , we must mobilise all possible mechanisms in order to speed up a process which will lead to the road map becoming a reality and not just remaining a piece of paper .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe we have the obligation , as Europeans , to do everything possible to ensure that this process , which will begin following yesterday 's elections , will be a process which leads to a good result , and so that the initiatives taken do not meet the same fate as previous initiatives , such as the Mitchell report or the Tenet Plan and other important reports which have been adopted but which have not been able to be implemented .
My appeal would therefore be that we should do everything possible to ensure that these documents do not remain simply documents in the archives but that they be implemented in reality .
Ladies and gentlemen , during the short time available to me for this first speech , I would also like to make one or two comments on North Korea .
Ladies and gentlemen , the situation in North Korea is serious .
It is difficult .
As you know , the decisions taken by the North Korean Government are serious decisions and I do not believe they are decisions which should only concern the countries of the region .
As I said at the beginning , I would insist that the issue of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is an issue which affects all of us , regardless of which part of the planet we are living in at this time .
And we must therefore involve ourselves to some extent in the issue of North Korea .
As you know , we hold meetings and telephone conversations practically every day with the most closely involved countries in the region : South Korea , Japan , China , Russia , the United States , and in the General Affairs Council on Monday the decision was taken , if necessary , to send a European Union mission to North Korea to present our position and also to cooperate in finding a solution to this dramatic problem which , if things carry on as they are , could lead to the existence of nuclear weapons of mass destruction in part of the Korean peninsula .
Ladies and gentlemen , I will move on to the last point I wanted to mention this afternoon , which is the situation in the Balkans and specifically the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
As you know , at the Copenhagen Summit an agreement was reached on relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance .
We are currently working so that in March we can for the first time in history deploy a peace-keeping force in that Republic .
The work is going well , the issues that have to be tackled with the Atlantic Alliance are making substantial progress , President Trajkovski of Macedonia has now accepted the presence of European forces from March and I believe we will be in a position to do that .
We also want to send a clear message to the countries of the Balkans ; our strategy is not to abandon the Balkans .
Our strategy does not just consist of remaining there , but of them remaining with us , of offering the countries of the Balkans the opportunity to participate in the construction of a wider Europe , so that they may come ever closer to the European institutions and so that they may establish themselves firmly as the important countries they should be in that region .
The deployment of military force in Macedonia would be the second peace-keeping operation taken on by Europe , since , as you know , since 1 January this year , the European police force is deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a replacement for the police force which was there under the flag of the United Nations .
Therefore , in a relatively short space of time , we have been able to implement two peace-keeping operations in an area close to our hearts and close geographically to our capitals and to Brussels .
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr President , I do not want to expand any further during this first speech .
I know that the honourable Members will have plenty of questions to ask me .
But I would like to say that we are living through a relatively difficult time and I would go as far as to say that this is perhaps the most difficult time those of us in this parliamentary sitting , during this period of European parliamentary life , have had to live through .
It is essential that we Europeans remain strong , clear and tenacious in our positions in order to do everything possible so that this crisis , which currently has so many fronts and so many manifestations , is one that can be resolved through the good will of everybody by means of agreement , dialogue and diplomacy .
Force is the last resort .
Diplomacy must always be our method .
( Applause )
Mr President , since at the last session of the Parliament in Strasbourg I was able to spend an hour with the Foreign Affairs Committee discussing North Korea under the benign stewardship of my honourable friend , the Member for Westphalia , and since last week we were able to spend two hours with the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy here discussing a wide range of issues , perhaps I could now concentrate on Iraq , bearing in mind the limitations imposed on the competences of the Commission .
I would like to make one remark at the outset : I think it is fair to say that , on the whole , since the Second World War , we have managed to create global institutions and international agreements which have helped make the world a much more prosperous and peaceful place .
I recall that , at the time of President Clinton 's second inaugural address , he was able to boast that there are today more people living under democracies than under tyrannies ; we ended the last century with a world which produced as much in two or three years as we had produced in the whole of the 19th century , with incalculable consequences for the living standards of most people .
This is not a bad record after a century which began so badly .
Plainly , not everything has gone so well .
Perhaps the greatest failure in trying to create a global rule-book has been our collective failure to establish an adequate regime for controlling and preventing the spread of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons - that terrible arsenal of unimaginable horror .
Today we face some of the consequences in three of the world 's most worrying trouble spots : in Kashmir , in the Korean peninsular and in the Gulf .
How can we deal with these problems ?
This was a point discussed in considerable detail in the Foreign Affairs Committee last week .
Clearly , we have to mobilise the greatest international commitment and the broadest authority for what we want to do .
That is why it must be sensible to base our approach in dealing with these problems on the moral and legal authority of the United Nations .
I think the whole of the European Parliament would believe that it was right to try to do that .
Everyone knows that , for years , Saddam Hussein has defied the authority of the United Nations over his manufacture , possession and use of weapons of mass destruction .
In addition , he has an appalling record on human rights .
In May last year , this Parliament adopted a resolution based on a report by Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne which outlined the clear evidence concerning the brutal and oppressive nature of his regime .
The report illustrated clearly how Saddam normally deals with Iraqi citizens , with his neighbours and with the international community .
We know , for example , that he has used chemical weapons on his own people .
After years of defying the authority of the United Nations , posing a threat to the region and to the whole world , he was given a final chance to cooperate in disarming his country by United Nations Security Council resolution 1441 .
A team of 260 staff members from 60 countries , of whom 100 are UNMOVIC inspectors , has been working in Iraq since 27 November 2002 under Dr Blix .
Besides UNMOVIC , there is also the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) team under Dr El Baradei .
Since the resumption of IAEA inspections , 139 inspections have been carried out on 106 sites , including two presidential sites .
I just mention , in passing , that anybody who has met the inspectors - for example , anybody who has met Dr Blix - will have been extremely impressed by the integrity and professionalism of those leading this UN operation .
I do not want to pronounce on the debate which is being held today in the Security Council .
As I am regularly reminded , the Commission is not a Member State .
We do , of course , contribute to the development of the common foreign and security policy .
We deploy the instruments within our competence to make it more effective .
Many of the issues we are discussing go to the heart of the debate about national sovereignty , which some appear to think has been solved by the proposal to create a full-time President of the Council .
While being clear about the limits of our role , let me however make a number of points .
First , it must be plain to all that the authority of the United Nations should be a paramount consideration .
The pity is that in the past we have stood by too often while the United Nations has been defied , thereby exposing ourselves to understandable charges of double standards .
( Applause )
Second , Saddam Hussein must work with the UN inspectors under Dr Blix to get rid of those weapons of mass destruction for which he has not yet accounted .
We should not forget that the issue at the heart of this crisis is how Saddam Hussein treats the rest of the world , not how the rest of the world treats Saddam Hussein .
( Applause )
We should not forget the sobering comment made this week by Dr Blix .
I quote : Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance , not even today , of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace .
Third , if inspectors can disarm Saddam Hussein , that is preferable by far to any other imaginable cause of action .
( Applause )
Any sensible person should want this crisis to be ended peacefully , if it is humanly possible to do so .
It would be good for the United Nations if we could accomplish this task without casualty , collateral damage or the daunting consequence of military intervention .
It would also be good for Iraq , for the region and , I would argue , very good for the world .
But that does rather assume that Saddam Hussein will now work with the inspectors .
Unfortunately , we have little evidence even now that he has yet learned that he cannot go on defying world opinion forever .
I have always believed that the terms of the UN resolution obliged us to face two realities : first , we must make a serious effort to disarm through inspection ; second , if the inspectors make it clear that this is a case of mission impossible , we cannot avoid facing up to the consequences .
The alternative would be the sort of humiliation that would make it more difficult to assert the authority of the United Nations in future cases .
I believe this to be an exceptionally serious debate and one which is going to have effects not just in this chamber but across Europe and the world .
It is going to shape the sort of world we live in and pass on to our kids and I do not think it is going to be helped by trading rhetoric .
Speaking like my youthful partner and friend , the High Representative , both of us have grown younger in these jobs .
Speaking like him as a proud citizen of old Europe - a part of old Europe which once had a spot of trouble with one of our colonies on the other side of the Atlantic - I have occasionally reflected that if King George had not played his hand so badly , if he had not made such a mess of things , then instead of fetching up as the last Governor of Hong Kong I might have finished up as the Governor of Arkansas or Texas , and then who knows what might have happened !
( Laughter and Applause )
Speaking as a citizen of old Europe , I would say that we need to remember that it is often wiser to raise a quizzical eyebrow than to return an insult .
We have to recognise that if we get this wrong and handle this crisis badly , the consequences could be profoundly serious and very long-lived : on the one hand , we could fatally damage the institutions of global cooperation and governance ; on the other , we could make the world a much more dangerous place .
We could weaken partnerships between friends , exacerbate relations with the Islamic world and worsen the prospects for solving crises elsewhere , for example in the Middle East .
Our ability to work together in Europe is also clearly on the line .
Needless to say , the Commission will discharge its responsibilities as best it can .
While I do not believe it is helpful to go into detail about the planning we have done to cater for a serious humanitarian crisis - for example , I was discussing this last autumn in Jordan - I can assure honourable Members that we will react with the generosity for which the Parliament is ultimately responsible and with the commitment and professionalism that the Parliament would expect of us .
I make this point very , very strongly : it will be easier for us to act , should we be required to act , if we can do so with the authority of the United Nations covering our activities .
I think I owe it to all those who work for the European Commission in the front line in providing humanitarian assistance , and to those who work for non-governmental organisations , very often in dangerous circumstances .
If we have to talk in the future about humanitarian activities and about what is described in the jargon as the humanitarian space , then I say strongly to this Parliament that it is far easier and far better to have UN authority covering that humanitarian space than to go ahead without it .
( Applause )
Earlier I mentioned speaking in the last Parliamentary session on North Korea and I will not repeat all that I said to the Foreign Affairs Committee on that occasion , but I do recognise the seriousness of the situation in North Korea .
I was in Pyongyang with the High Representative and the Swedish Prime Minister almost two years ago .
I think that we played a useful role , without exaggerating what we were capable of doing .
In my judgment , the only way this crisis can be resolved is through diplomacy , through expecting more of the DPRK , on this occasion in relation to nuclear promises in response to a greater commitment by the international community to welcome North Korea into the real world .
Since I think it is only through diplomacy that we can actually resolve that crisis , I do think there may be a role for the European Union to play in the coming weeks .
That , I am glad to say , was the decision reached by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday and Tuesday .
I am sure this will not be the last occasion on which we debate soberly these difficult issues , soberly but with a passion which I hope will be sometimes constrained in its rhetorical expression by the grave and serious issues that we are discussing .
( Applause )
Mr President , Mr Solana , Commissioner Patten , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to decide between war and peace , we must conduct our debate with the greatest seriousness , but also with confidence in ourselves .
The wisdom of old Europe , this continent of ours , lies in its capacity for repeated renewal , and we should be telling all those who cast doubt on our credentials , that the policy of uniting Europe is the greatest peace movement on the European continent - old , yet ever renewing itself - and that perhaps other regions in the world will find it an example of peaceful coexistence .
What I ask , ladies and gentlemen , is that we should respect each other 's points of view .
It is certain that we will come to different conclusions on one thing or another , but each of us expresses opinions founded on his or her own convictions , and then we have to see to it that we take the right path .
It is quite clear to us in the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats that we have to make every conceivable effort and attempt to secure world peace and peace in the Middle East - in so far as this is the nub of the problem .
That must be our concern ; it is that for which we must work , and the United Nations is the framework within which we must do it .
Ladies and gentlemen , even if the use of force in the form of warfare may never be more than the last resort , and though our endeavours must be guided by peace , we have to deal with the facts as they are presented to us .
What we have to deal with in Iraq is a criminal system under a dictator and tyrant alleged to have weapons of mass destruction at his disposal - and that is the problem .
He is a mass murderer and a war criminal , who , as Commissioner Patten has mentioned , has , in particular , used chemical weapons against his own people , against the Kurds .
In 1980 , he declared war on Iran , and in 1990 he invaded Kuwait .
I take a thoroughly critical line on the United States too , but , ladies and gentlemen , if the United States had not , at that time , led the coalition that liberated Kuwait , might this same dictator not have been able to include the other Arab countries in his expansionist designs ?
That , too , is something we must bear in mind today .
His regime uses its secret services to oppress his own people with violence , murder and terror .
Ladies and gentlemen , weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Saddam Hussein and his regime are a menace to the region as a whole and to the international community .
Whatever the need to be frank when talking to our American friends , it has to be said that the heart of the problem is not the USA , but Saddam Hussein 's criminal regime in Baghdad .
( Applause from the centre and the right )
Ladies , gentlemen , friends , because Iraq , with which we find ourselves dealing in the present situation , is an Arab country , we are also saying loud and clear to the Arab and Muslim world that we want cooperation , we want partnership , and we want friendship - if at all possible - with all Arab and Muslim states , and this must be one of the key fundamentals of European Union policy .

I wish to extend warm thanks not only to Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten , but also to all those who are working hard in these difficult days and weeks , and I wish to thank the President of Parliament , Mr Cox , for facilitating yesterday 's discussion with Hans Blix , from which I learned a very great deal .
We agreed that this discussion would be confidential - it could scarcely have taken place had we not done so - but I agree , and our group agrees , that many years have passed since 1990 , in which the international community has taken no real action against Saddam Hussein , and so , if we are to achieve the peaceful solution for which we hope , we have to keep up the pressure of recent months , which he is now coming to feel .
This has to be a window for peace ; it must also mean - and it is to be hoped that it does - that our American partners and friends have not yet decided on military action against Iraq .
We have to be open to a truly peaceful solution , which must be reached through the United Nations .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must also , however , keep reminding ourselves of the logic involved .
The discussion we had with Dr Blix yesterday touched on this .
Logic cannot require the inspectors to travel the length and breadth of Iraq to look to see where something might be .
It is far more logical for the Iraqi regime to do as Resolution 1441 requires and actually open the gates , so that Dr Blix and his team do not have to virtually grope their way through Iraq with a glimmering lamp .
On the contrary , as Mr Solana has said and as is stated in Resolution 1441 , what is required is genuinely active cooperation by the regime in Baghdad .
That is what we have to insist on , ladies and gentlemen .
We hear the President 's White House spokesman saying , ' either he disarms or he will be disarmed ' , and so we urge Saddam Hussein to delay no longer in playing his part in this .
Let me quote Hans Blix , who said , on one occasion , that ' it does not , to date , appear that Iraq has really accepted the demand for disarmament ' , and on another , that paragraph 9 of Resolution 1441 requires that cooperation be ' active ' .
Simply opening doors is not enough .
There are questions that Hans Blix has raised , and which we also have to put before the public : what about the anthrax , which is a biological weapon ?
What became of the 8 500 litres of it ?
What about the VX , a toxic chemical weapon on which further development work has been done ?
If Iraq really has disarmed as it claims to have done , it would have been right and proper and in line with international law for this to have been done under UN supervision , as prescribed by the documents and the resolutions .
I hope that Iraq will be more cooperative over the coming days and weeks .
Ladies and gentlemen , on Monday the Council of European Union Foreign Ministers decided , quite rightly , to call for complete disarmament , but we have to take the middle way - and everyone knows the difficult position Europeans are in .
Our slogan cannot be ' right or wrong , always America ! '
That is a road down which we cannot go , but neither can we go down the road of saying that , no matter what Iraq 's response may be , the Iraqi dictator will go unpunished , and that we will not play our part !
To do so would be like saying to someone bent upon murder , ' please don 't commit murder , but if you do , there will be no criminal proceedings anyway ' .
That is why we have to keep up the pressure !
What we demand of the US Government is that , if our American partners and friends have intelligence derived from secret service operations , this must also be laid out to public view in the Security Council , so that we may really be in full possession of the facts .
People have to be informed , and so we are very decidedly of the opinion that Iraq must dispose of any weapons of mass destruction that it possesses .
We want to achieve this through the United Nations , and we want to achieve it by peaceful means !
( Applause )
Mr President , Mr High Representative , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to say first of all that we are against war : no to war and no to dictators , and that means we must work actively within a multilateral framework to eliminate weapons of mass destruction .
The debate we are holding at the moment with our most important ally , the United States , revolves , rather than around the fundamental issue , around counter-productive methods and - as ex-President Clinton quite rightly said ? on erratic methods .
Why ?
Because ten years ago , when we were in a coalition with the United States in the Kuwait war , President Bush Senior said that the Iraqi people would sooner or later topple the dictator .
Ten years later , we must recognise that sanctions have not weakened Saddam Hussein and that we are still dealing with the same issues in relation to weapons of mass destruction .
We must therefore say that we are in favour of a clear policy of applying pressure on the basis of the Security Council 's resolutions .
War is not inevitable .
We must work on the basis that peace must be given a chance , but we must not be hasty and of course we must not create situations which may be entirely counter-productive .
Hence our opposition to a preventive attack and our support for negotiations within the framework of international law .
Mr President , a unilateral intervention , without the support of the UN , would have devastating effects throughout the Middle East , leading to more suffering , more radicalisation of Arab public opinion and would jeopardise the spirit of coalition in the fight against terrorism .


And since Mr Solana is going to congratulate Mr Sharon on having won the elections in Israel , I would ask him to add something else , and that is to tell Mr Sharon to stop spurning Europe and to take account of our will for peace and cooperation .
Secondly , Iraq must comply seriously with the inspection requirements and I would like to thank the President for quickly accepting my proposal to hold the videoconference .
It was very interesting .
Yesterday we spoke with a European citizen who was proud to be one , Dr Blix , who asked Europe to take a more active position and who also explained to us , although he did not ask for it , that if the inspections could continue for two more months , as proposed by Mohammed ElBaradei , the Egyptian expert , results could be achieved .
I believe that that should be the basis for the European course of action .
Our approach should be the one the President-in-Office of the Council , Minister Papandreu , was able to outline at the General Affairs Council on Monday , in the face of the self-flagellation we always indulge in , by means of an agreement with the four member countries of the Security Council and with Bulgaria , so that there may be a European position which supports the work of the inspectors and so that those inspections may continue .
I would also like to point out that Dr Blix also told us that between 1991 and 1998 the inspectors were at work .
If they were working for eight years , why can they not work for two more months ?
Nobody understands this , and neither do they understand why President Bush is offering evidence now , two months later .
Why did he not do so before ?
We must all work as faithful allies and with regard to the statement of Defence Secretary Rumsfeld , who spoke of the old Europe , I must say that those people in our continent who have spoken of a new Europe are the ones who have caused endless disasters in our continent .
We are not in favour of a new Europe , we are building a united Europe , and that is the aim of our political action .
And , Mr President , please allow me to refer to an important aspect of the issue on which I would like to hear more clarifications from the representative of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission .
It concerns the risks of humanitarian disaster , not only in Iraq but throughout the Middle East , with hundreds of thousands of displaced persons at least : who will pay for that ?
Do we have measures to deal with it ?
Has the UN considered this ?
This is an important issue , as is the economic situation , and not just that of Europe .
The price of oil is going through the roof ; it is worrying that the United States ' world map of priorities always coincides with the countries which have significant reserves of oil .
This is not the way to build a future for humanity , and we must also declare ourselves clearly in favour of not having to face an economic disaster .
Finally , Mr President , we have the right to know whether weapons of mass destruction really exist .
To this end , we need more proof and more evidence and they will be obtained through continued work .
The debate is not only on the timetable but on how to move forward in order to prevent war .
And finally , Mr President , please allow me to use a quote in English from a great American , Mr Madison , who in 1792 said :
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , we are on a knife-edge .
On the one hand , the Security Council has given the inspectors the green light they wanted to continue their mission in the short term ; on the other , the US-British armada in the Gulf is increasing in size by the day , much like the pressure to launch a military attack .
In this context of great tension where the stakes are so high , any ambiguous political words or action on the war , but also , where applicable , any absence of initiative against the war , actually constitute an advantage for the most aggressive and unilateralist government the United States has ever known .
A builder 's work can be recognised from its foundations , and , in the same way , Europe 's ambition on the global stage can be measured in a critical international situation .
Mr Solana , you seem to welcome the common position of the Fifteen , or in any case of the four countries that currently sit on the Security Council .
This does not merit such rejoicing .
The declaration had only just been published when London and Madrid , in particular , were already stripping it of its substance by stating , respectively , that there was a flagrant violation of resolution 1441 , and that the extension of the deadline granted to the inspectors should be as short as possible .
Still others are doing their utmost to find passages in Dr Blix 's report to take out of context in order to try to justify military intervention .
Everything seems to imply that , in the eyes of some , it would not be good news but bad news if Dr Blix were to state that the inspectors had been able , overall , to access all sites easily , to the point of having carried out 300 inspections in 60 days .
Or if Mr ElBaradei thought it were possible , and I quote ' within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme ' .
Of course there are still grey areas that absolutely must be clarified .
We will not , however , achieve this through bombs and blood .
We must speak frankly and on the other hand be far more aggressive in demanding that the inspectors be allowed to take the time they need to complete their work .
Beware of playing down war !
Beware of gradually and insidiously accepting the unacceptable !
Let us therefore review everything that Europe has accepted , with little or no reaction , from Ariel Sharon in Palestine over the past two years .
He does not deserve congratulations , Mr Solana .
We must resolutely fight his disastrous policy , including for the Israeli people themselves .
What did Europe have to say about George Bush 's new strategic doctrine , published on 20 September last , which magnifies , and I quote , ' the unequalled strength ' of the United States and emphasises , and I quote once again , their determination ' to act alone , if necessary [ ? ] pre-emptively ' in order to ' further freedom 's triumph ' .
What does Europe have to say now in response to the irresponsible statements made by the Secretary-General of the White House last Sunday , implying that the United States would not rule out the use of tactical nuclear weapons in case of conflict in Iraq .
Weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed and banned in Iraq , throughout the region , and all over the world .
We must listen to public opinion .
( Applause )
Mr Blair and Mr Aznar are isolated in their own countries over the question of war .
There is an overwhelming majority against war in Germany .
Four out of five French citizens are asking Paris to use the right to veto if necessary to try to prevent the worst from happening .
On the other side of the Atlantic , a movement unprecedented since Vietnam is gathering momentum , based on the slogan , and how clear it is : ' No blood for oil ' .
( Mr Le Pen : It sounds like Europe in 1938 ! )
Calm down !
We are not interested in hearing what you think about it .
My group would like to be able to state these values , state these requirements in Iraq itself , without the slightest leniency towards the authorities , Mr Watson , quite the opposite - nobody , furthermore , will find in my entire political history the slightest leniency towards this dictator , nobody , which is not the case of certain right-wing governments - ...
( Applause )
... without the slightest leniency towards the authorities , therefore , and within a population that has already suffered the effects of a criminal embargo for twelve years .
That is why my group is unanimous , as are my Green and socialist fellow Members , and even Members from other parliamentary groups , in suggesting that a delegation of Members should go to Baghdad from 2 to 6 February .
There will be more than thirty of us .
In the same vein , my group suggests sending - and will do so - a delegation to the United States .
In Baghdad and in New York or Washington , we want to defend an idea of Europe , Mr President , in which many progressive men and women still place their hopes .
We must not let them down !
( Applause )
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we run the risk today of repeating ourselves .
Personally , I would like to make a suggestion .
Obviously nobody here today is defending a dictator .
Those who were communist no longer are , and are not defending any communist dictatorships .
I also think that none of those who visited Saddam Hussein to deliver nuclear power stations to him , or , for example , like that young American who was close to the Secretary of State at the time , going by the name of Mr Rumsfeld , to deliver chemical weapons to be dropped on Iran , would now do what they did at the time .
We should take note of this , but the problem lies elsewhere .
The problem is the credibility of an international institution when it comes to imposing something defined intelligently by a German sociologist : ' Make law , not war ' .
The problem today is knowing whether we are capable of imposing international law .
In this situation - as Mr Patten and Mr Solana have said - the argument is this : if Iraq does not cooperate , we shall have to force it to disarm .
You are therefore advocating military intervention in the short or medium term .
I believe that , within the context of international order , we must define those situations in which we should fight dictatorships and those in which we should use diplomatic means .
I am indeed saying that I , who , often against my group or other groups , have defended and still defend military intervention in Kosovo and Afghanistan .
I also believe it was right , once again against the majority of my group , to intervene when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait , but I believe that today , Saddam Hussein has not been so weak for ten years or so .
He is a bloodthirsty dictator who is weak and who is now incapable of attacking other countries .
That is the distinction in the fight against dictatorships : those which act against other countries and those which do not .
In fact , with regard to butchery , ladies and gentlemen : four million dead in Uganda , with machetes , not with weapons of mass destruction , they killed each other with machetes .
What did we do ?
Who intervened to stop this bloodletting ?
Nobody !
Nobody intervened !
So , let us stay calm .
We have seen millions of deaths , blood , and nobody was interested : there was no oil .
We took years to intervene in Bosnia : there was no oil .
So let us moderate our great speeches on dictatorships , and murders , and dying children .
There is a problem , however .
Iran now possesses missiles .
Iran is currently equipping itself with a nuclear arsenal .
Iran could now attack Israel , Europe , Greece and reach these regions .
Is anyone suggesting a military foray into Iran ?
Obviously not !
That would be too dangerous .
Today , North Korea has said it wants to produce nuclear weapons .
Is anyone suggesting military intervention ?
Of course not !
That would be too dangerous .
With the arguments developed with regard to Iraq , we are creating a programme of nuclear proliferation .
We are telling dictators to possess weapons of mass destruction so that nobody attacks them !
That is the truth .
That is why we must step back .
Fine , the Americans and the English are surrounding Iraq , so Iraq cannot move .
So we have time .
We can wait a year .
We can say that the soldiers should stay where they are .
At the same time , however , let us show the world what we are capable of .
Let us solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem while still threatening Saddam Hussein .
Let us change the agenda and our priorities .
That said , let us not fool ourselves , if the inspectors are there now , it is because the soldiers are present .
Let us take advantage of this situation , however , to contain the problem and avoid making war .
At the same time , let us try to obtain negotiations with the Middle East .
I believe that Ariel Sharon will form a coalition forcing him to negotiate with the Palestinians .
First of all he must be forced to let the Palestinians elect their own representatives so that they can negotiate with the Israelis .
Let us change the agenda .
Let us find a solution to the Middle East and you will see that the Arab masses will applaud us if we have to sort out Saddam Hussein .
If initially , however , we first sort out Saddam Hussein , perhaps for oil , without having taken and carried out any initiative in the Middle East , we will not be credible and we will not create greater justice in the world .
So , ' make law , not war ' , change the agenda , give us time , stay there for a year or two .
We will disarm Saddam Hussein , but first of all let us find a solution to the Middle East .
( Applause )
Mr President , in our opinion , the essential question now in relation to the Iraqi crisis is how the international community should act in the face of the threat from a dictatorial regime that might or might not have - this is what is being investigated - the capacity to develop or acquire , when they only have access to scarce technical and financial resources , weapons of mass destruction , be they biological or chemical , likely to endanger regional safety and world peace , and potentially to use or supply these to others , particularly terrorists .
The question is how to deal with an undemocratic regime that has breached and continues systematically to breach its international commitments and obligations within the United Nations . This is also a regime that has imposed all kinds of constraints on its people , demonstrating total contempt for their most basic political , economic and social rights .
Having said that , the issue is not , as some have said , America 's control of Iraq 's oil resources , even if Iraq does have the world 's second largest oil reserves and on top of that , its crude oil is of the very highest quality .
This is not the issue , because if it were , we would clearly have to acknowledge that there are also European interests in this area .
In fact , the European Union is already seeing many Iraqi oil transactions taking place in euros and , due to their volume , these transactions contribute considerably to the strength and stability of the European currency as a means of international payment .
To take just one example , we could mention the contracts that Russian oil and gas companies have signed with Iraqi companies , which , according to the press , total 40 billion euros ( not dollars ) .
Mr President , when we criticise a policy , we must come up with alternative proposals and solutions .
We cannot simply oppose options that some consider to be warmongering ; we must provide a response that is proportionate to the threats made by the other side , in the shape of someone who , in the past , has shown complete contempt for international law and who is still failing to provide guarantees that he will respect such law now and in future .
We are the first to say that the solution to the conflict must be sought up to the last minute through peaceful and diplomatic means , but we also maintain that the international community , under the auspices of the United Nations , must maintain a firm attitude that leaves no room for doubt as to the need for the Iraqi authorities to cooperate fully and extremely soon with the UN inspectors . If they do not cooperate , they will have to face other means being used to make them do so .
As a matter of fact , it is worth asking whether dictators who generally rule without any constraint and particularly without the democratic scrutiny of their public , only understand and respect the language of diplomacy , the language that has always been used , as Javier Solana said , when it is backed up and given credibility by the means of coercion available to it , the last resort , as he also said ?
We support the work of the UN inspectors and hope that they are given all the means and all the information necessary to conclude their task , and I mean all information , even information already available to other countries .
At the same time , however , we must issue a warning about the need to prevent the Iraqis from indulging in time-wasting manoeuvres in order to put off complying with the UN resolutions without good reason and to ensure that the current status quo remains in place .
Mr President , we make a clear distinction between Iraq 's totalitarian regime and its people .
As I said , the Iraqi people have been the main victims of the oligarchy governing them and which uses them to achieve its own ends .
This is precisely why we are calling on the international community to unite on the fundamental issue , for the transatlantic relationship to be strengthened , for the conditions to be established to ensure that we do not see the inspections blocked , constraints put on the evidence given by scientists and officials linked to Iraq 's nuclear programmes and that this game of hide and seek with arsenals of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein 's supporters is brought to an end .
If we achieve this , if we unite on the fundamental issue , the conditions might then be created for beginning the process of democratisation in Iraq and for enabling its people to enjoy the advantages of peace .
Political torment plagued Europe in the last century .
The ideologically ' legitimised ' obsession with power on the part of dictators created millions of victims .
They certainly did not spare their own citizens .
Is the parallel with the loathsome regime of Saddam Hussein not obvious here ?
We should therefore be talking about ' liberation ' and not ' war ' in respect of Iraq .
At least that is how Saddam 's living victims see it .
Sadly enough , they cannot count on the unanimous support of the Member States of the European Union in this regard .
In fact the opposite is true .
The concept of the containment of Saddam 's reign of terror is evidently being fostered in the European Union despite all the extremely negative experiences with Baghdad 's Ba 'athists over the past 10 years .
Today this strategy is being continued in the European desire to extend the UN inspections in Iraq .
That Saddam is again flouting a compulsory Security Council resolution does not spoil the European illusion of Saddam 's total disarmament .
It is first and foremost the inhabitants of Mesopotamia who are the ongoing victims of the international community 's failure to appreciate the true nature of Saddam 's ' Republic of Fear ' .
Do the Member States of the European Union want to have this on their consciences , particularly given their own painful experiences during the last century ?
Furthermore , Iraq under Saddam remains a permanent potential threat to the entire Middle East , not least on account of her oil reserves .
Desperate diseases need desperate remedies , as the saying goes .
War is awful , but the consequences of an overly tolerant attitude may in time cause more devastation .
Recent European history should show government leaders their responsibility in this regard .
, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
( DE ) Mr President , representatives of the Commission , Mr Solana , I believe that both you , Mr Solana , and Commissioner Patten have made it clear that the European Union has achieved a number of foreign policy successes of which we should remind ourselves at the present time .
For if you add up the number of operations the European Union has mounted in Bosnia and in Macedonia , and consider the great burden that European forces in Afghanistan are taking upon themselves , as well as the fact that the European Union devotes three times as much of its budget to overseas aid as does the United States of America , all these important factors are , in my view , things of which old Europe can be proud .
At the same time , we should also remember that the achievements that this month has seen - the eastward and southward enlargement of the European Union and the consequent extension of the zone of stability and democracy - play a decisive part in making the world more peaceful .
The primary motive for the enlargement of the European Union is that it will extend the stability zone .
I think that we should make that point by incorporating this into the integrated approach .
Hitherto , admittedly , we lacked the ability to speak with one voice when it came to issues of war and peace , a defect dating back as far as last summer .
For if one says that he will join in whatever happens and another that he will not under any circumstances , that makes it difficult to find a middle way , but thank God we have found the essentials of one with help from the French President and from you , Mr Solana and Commissioner Patten .

Ladies and gentlemen , it must also be clear in this context - if we are honest with ourselves - that if we are to get our voice heard everywhere , be it in New York , Washington , or Baghdad , it will only be by attempting to work out a common position based on the knowledge that this is the only way .
This is the road we must take , rather than following others on their celebratory processions , whether these be to Baghdad or to Washington .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is my belief that we should now press on with the endeavour that the Council has - God be thanked - set in motion this week , which , for the time being at least , gave us a halfway reasonable position , with the multilateral approach being particularly valued and preferred , and with the attempt being made , within the UN framework , at finding a peaceful solution .
It must , however , be made clear that this must be kept up to the very end .
This is a consensus that does not just last for eight days , but one that must be made to work .
Ladies and gentlemen , any consideration of these matters must of course have as its starting point the view of the international community - expressed , for example , in Resolution 1441 - that Iraqi disarmament must take place , and that Saddam Hussein must play an active part in it .
Dr Blix , for example , has stated that these conditions have not been met , and so it is a good thing that the efforts of many have gained us a breathing space , time that must be used to find a peaceful solution , by which I mean the dismantling of the weapons of mass destruction - insofar as they actually exist - and the disarmament of Iraq , thus enabling the will of the international community , as expressed in international law , to prevail .
However , ladies and gentlemen , Dr Blix 's inspectors need to have the same information as is held by those who claim they were already aware that there was something there and that they would at some point present the facts to the public .
In my view , Dr Blix should be told the facts right now , for how are we to explain to the public that a war is inevitable if we do not tell even our allies ' inspectors the whole truth , thus enabling them to find what they are looking for ?
It seems to me that something of a credibility gap is developing here , one that may cause a great deal of damage in days to come .
It should not , however , be forgotten , when considering this issue , that Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer .
Baroness Nicholson and I were in an Iranian camp for Iraqi refugees , and I have seen how people had to live there , having been driven from their homes and tormented by Saddam Hussein 's chemical weapons .
The depiction of Saddam Hussein as someone who represents no real danger does not strike me as credible .
Ladies and gentlemen , we should also be clear in our own minds about the real menace of weapons of mass destruction when they are in the hands of people such as Saddam Hussein , particularly if he is to emerge from this conflict as the victor , with all the resulting effects on the region 's morale .
We should also be stating what is to happen once the war is over .
What form is political reconstruction to take ?
For how long will Western troops have to remain there ?
To what extent does this relate to the creation of a new order in the region as a whole , what sort of new order will that be , and at what cost ?
To date , I have heard no answer to these questions , and I believe that if you are going to go into something , you have to think about how you are going to get out again .
Mr President , Mr Solana , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , I will begin with a quotation , one which sums up like no other statement our position on the war against Iraq : ' A preventive war is an act of aggression , and cannot be described as a just war in self-defence .
For the right to self-defence presupposes not merely the possibility of an attack , but that an attack is actually happening or is imminent .
Warfare with the aim of averting danger would nullify international law 's prohibition of force , promote political instability and , in the final analysis , shatter the foundations of the whole system of an international community of states . '
And elsewhere in the same statement : ' Any security strategy committing itself to preventive warfare is in defiance both of Catholic teaching and of international law . '
These quotations are from the statement on the Iraq conflict issued , on 20 January of this year , by the Conference of German Bishops .
As my Christian Democrat opposite number has not made reference to the Conference of Catholic Bishops , I have to do so , and do not think that these statements require anything to be added to them .
All the time I have known you , Mr Solana , I have regarded you as a great optimist , so when you say , as you have done today , that the political situation is bad , then the political situation is very bad .
Donald Rumsfeld , the American minister for war , spoke of ' old Europe ' .
All of us who have spoken here today have declared that we belong to this old Europe , and that would not be cause for any further excitement on our part , had he not drawn the distinction between us and the ' new Europe ' - those whose opinions are identical with Mr Rumsfeld 's and who think along the same lines as he does .
President Kwasniewski of Poland said in an interview last week , ' If it is President Bush 's vision , it is mine ! '
The Polish President is of course entitled to as narrow a field of vision as he may choose , but there is no doubt that the Polish government - like all the governments of the other candidate countries - is under an obligation to act in solidarity with the European Union , to which they want to belong .
The candidate countries have decided of their own free will to belong to the European Union , and we wish to welcome them , but , when it comes to issues of war and peace , preventive warfare and the setting-aside of international law , we expect them to be solidly alongside us .
Mr President , Mr Solana and Mr Kinnock , it is very good that we are having this debate .
It is a very complex issue , and developments are taking place so quickly that the situation is changing almost from one day to the next .
This means that any resolution becomes obsolete extremely quickly .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party really appreciates the efforts you are making , Mr Solana , towards uniting the EU around a single policy .
The Greek Presidency shares this ambition .
It is no easy task .
At the same time , it is very clear that the EU is not united .
In all facets of the Iraq issue we have heard differing views from different capital cities .
I dare say that it has never before been so evident that the EU has failed in developing a common foreign and security policy .
For all the fine words and the rhetoric , we stand empty-handed ; which is terribly tragic .
It might be possible to compensate for this if we start now to make attempts to reach agreement on a strategy for what we want to see happening after Saddam Hussein , whether or not there is a war .
What should be done with Saddam Hussein ?
What role should the EU play in the reconstruction process ?
How could peace , freedom , democracy and human rights be guaranteed for the people of Iraq , who have suffered for so long ?
How is the EU to help in improving the humanitarian situation , and how prepared are we to help the neighbouring countries with the refugees who are already pouring out of Iraq ?
It goes without saying that we all hope that a war can be avoided .
It is obvious that the inspectors , under the leadership of Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei , need more time .
Iraq and Saddam Hussein are playing games with us ; one cannot help feeling that they have something to hide .
Iraq must pull itself together .
It is Iraq 's own responsibility , not that of the UN , to prove that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country .
The question of war or peace lies in Iraq 's own hands .
Our view is that the inspectors need more time , a view expressed by many others here .
When they report to the Security Council again in a few weeks ' time , it will be the UN Security Council that will take decisions on what is to happen next .
Any decisions on a military strike , which might unfortunately be necessary , must be taken by the UN .
A unilateral US strike would be extremely unfortunate , not only with regard to its consequences for the region , but also because it would harm transatlantic relations a very , very long way into the future .
Lastly , I must express my regret that individual MEPs are going to Baghdad on their own initiative .
I am convinced that they are doing so with good intentions , but this will be exploited by the Iraqi dictator to reinforce the image of disharmony in the international community .
Those who go there cannot influence Saddam Hussein : he has not shown himself to be open to argument .
Instead , they run the risk of becoming his hostages and getting in the way of the work of the inspectors .
It is of course up to individuals whether or not they decide to travel , but the European Parliament is in danger of looking extremely ridiculous on the international stage .
I would advise strongly against making this journey .
Mr President , I too am inclined to think that we should take a little look back in time .
Who was it really that created Saddam Hussein ?
It was the United States , and they used him in the war against Iran .
When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons of mass destruction against his own people , the United States was informed of the fact .
An American attack on Iraq would not only be an attack on an individual country .
It would be an attack on international law and upon the whole UN system .
That is why it is important for Mr Solana and Mr Patten to call upon all the Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder in the EU on this matter in order to safeguard international law and to ensure a future for the UN .
I think that Great Britain and Spain , specifically , should be called upon to show that they too join with the EU in rejecting war .
It would not of course be a war to disarm Iraq and introduce democracy there .
Is it at all conceivable that the United States would install a Shia Muslim government in Iraq , reminiscent of the government in neighbouring Iran ?
Is that within the bounds of possibility ?
Could one imagine the United States allowing the Kurds their independence ?
Certainly , not much importance can be attached , then , to the talk of democracy .
If the intention is to disarm Iraq , then that is the role assigned - rightly - to the weapons inspectors .
If the desire is to disarm Iraq , it is a question of supporting the work being done by the weapons inspectors and Hans Blix .
There is of course also the alternative of strengthening democracy in Iraq by removing the sanctions , other than those concerned with chemical and other weapons , including weapons of mass destruction .
In that way , it would be possible to strengthen the Iraqi people and the democratic forces in Iraq , as well as democracy and peace for all of us .
We also have another task .
It is to ensure that the whole region is inspected and that we obtain a policy for disarming it : not only Iraq but also Iran and Israel .
In conclusion , I want to state that we must urge Saddam Hussein to cooperate with the weapons inspectors so that we avoid a war .
I believe that the way forward is through democracy , development and cooperation .
Mr President , it is chilling to see how the preparations to invade Iraq have gathered pace , despite the extra time given to the weapons inspectors which , of course , we all welcome .
We are seeing a situation where the most powerful country in the world has made clear its determination to wage war against Iraq , with or without United Nations backing and whether or not the weapons inspectors find any weapons of mass destruction .
A pre-emptive attack like this would set a new international precedent that has no basis in the United Nations Charter .
Such a war on Iraq would be immoral , unjustifiable and illegal .
It would make the world a much more dangerous place , causing more resentment and fuelling more terrorism .
The victims , as always , would be the innocent civilians : the hundreds of thousands of men and women and particularly the children who have already suffered years of oppression , hardship and sanctions which have put them under the complete control of Saddam Hussein .
There is already a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and now the people are being threatened again .
Britain has already announced the deployment of some 30,000 troops and the United States 130,000 troops which are being mobilised in readiness to attack .
Opposition to this war is growing with every day that passes by groups of people of all ages , from all walks of life , and on 15 February 2003 there are going to be peace demonstrations right around the world .
Those of us elected by the people in Europe can speak in this Parliament on behalf of so many of them who are saying no to war .
I have received many letters from Wales and from other countries asking the European Parliament to do everything that it can to try and stop this war .
Peaceful means of solving the problems have not been properly explored , let alone exhausted .
It is tragic that if a fraction of the effort made by the United States and the United Kingdom to kindle their support for war had been put into bringing peace in the Middle East , we would live in a much safer and more peaceful world .
Mr President , all statements - from any government or any government representative - seeking to point out differences between positions or diplomatic shortcomings are unwise .
Diplomacy should have led us in Europe to formulate joint or , at least , homogeneous positions .
I therefore regret that , instead of working towards a European position or , at least , mediation through a Council meeting , we have split up and established unilateral parameters and positions which do nothing to further either the cause of peace or the development of a common foreign policy , and a common foreign policy is one of the goals towards which the Convention is working .
The United States is not the only guardian of peace and justice , nor is it the only country qualified to declare war should that prove to be necessary and unavoidable in the interests of the common good .
The contrasting statements which have been made in recent days promote the cause of the dictator , Saddam Hussein , rather than the development of what is a problematic peace process .
I therefore , Mr President , call upon the Council , working together with the other European institutions , to concentrate on creating a climate of more serene cooperation between the countries of the Union , so that we can unite in an agreement and address the increasingly serious problems before us every day together .
I would like to thank Mr Berlusconi for the mediation initiative he has undertaken in the last few hours and I hope that everyone will work for peace , just as we must all strive to combat terrorism and dictatorships , even if that means declaring war .
Mr President , no one should be in any doubt that I shall celebrate on the day that Saddam Hussein 's regime of terror comes to an end .
I do not , however , believe for one moment that a war is the correct solution to the problem .
President Bush believes in absolute good and absolute evil . I , for my part , do not .
I am convinced , rather , that Mr Bush 's , Mr Cheney 's and Mrs Condoleezza Rice 's interests in the oil industry are significantly greater than their concern for the well-being of the Iraqi people .
Nor do I entertain any doubts that a war would be a unique opportunity to test approximately 20 new weapons systems , as well as being good for the American arms industry .
Of course Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions .
So must Israel too , moreover , and I anxiously await the relevant demands on the part of the United States and the EU .
All methods other than war must be tried and , if war is unavoidable , it must be backed up by the UN and supported by powerful forces in Iraq itself .
Let us not forget that the United States was once an enthusiastic supporter of Saddam Hussein and supplied him with some of his conventional weapons .
Iraq does not constitute any immediate threat , either to its neighbours or to the global community .
A war , on the other hand , could have completely unpredictable consequences .
It would fuel increased hatred towards the United States and the West and create a breeding ground for further terrorism .
There has been no success in improving the lives of the Afghan people , and there would scarcely be any success , either , in improving the lot of the Iraqis .
The same applies to the sanctions against Iraq , which have merely made it easier for Saddam to oppress his people .
At a time when people 's education is largely left to mullahs and the indoctrination they practise , what , I wonder , would happen if the United States were to use only 10 % of the money expected to be spent on the war on providing the Arab world with , for example , free schools ?
That would be a far-sighted and long-term solution .
War would be a short-sighted and anything but long-term solution .
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , everyone seems to be for peace , saying ' No to war ' .
Can you see anyone saying ' Yes to war ' ?
Everyone - the Pope , the antipope , the communists , the fascists , everyone - is saying ' No to war ' .
What is the alternative to ' No to war ' , however ?
Specifically , it is the risk of war breaking out - which you have mentioned - in 15 , 20 or 30 days ' time .
What a wonderful success for the European Union : it would appear that the European Union has , at last , achieved agreement on a practical matter , if I am not mistaken , in calling for the inspectors to be given a few more weeks , for them to be given a little more time , a little more money , resources and a little more support .
Later on , however , after 20 days , will there be a different strategy ?
What will Europe propose ?
The alternative to the destruction we call war - how do we , how do you see it ?
There is an alternative , and it is not peace : peace is what we have at the moment .
For the time being , we are not at war , as you say , as my friend , Mr Le Pen , says , for whom the value of freedom and the value of fundamental human rights do not exist .
That is his opinion !
We all know the sorts of things that Mr Le Pen can say and the meanings that can be inferred .
You can all go together : Mr Le Pen went to visit Saddam Hussein 12 , 13 or 14 years ago with Mr Fini ; now you can all go together .
I can see some logic in all this .
We radicals have presented a proposal .
In the space of four days , we have received approval from 66 countries .
In Italy , to date , we have received approval from 57 Members of Parliament , half of them centre-left and half of them centre-right , including the former Prime Minister , Mr Andreotti , and other important figures who support this proposal .
What are we suggesting ? What proposal are we now submitting to you too ?
The alternative is called ' democracy ' , the alternative is called ' law ' and ' rights ' , the alternative consists of enforcing written international law at last - for , although it is in force , it is not being enforced , as often happens in our country - that international law which , all things considered , has now identified a kind of subjective right to freedom and democracy belonging to the people living in this country , and by ' this country ' we mean the world .

We have the chance to choose what the European Union wants , to choose whether it wants war or not , whether it wants Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq - for , whatever Mr Watson may say , he will leave accompanied , he will essentially have safe conduct as far as his place of exile , and , moreover , I would advise Mr Watson to read the Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court , from which he will learn that , in any case , Saddam Hussein cannot be prosecuted in this situation - but what we can and must do is realise that the UN and the Security Council have a duty to act .
It is not a question of changing the dictator but of changing the regime .
That is what is needed in this part of the world , where the gun held to Saddam Hussein 's temple , for better or worse , now gives him the chance to make a limited choice between falling in a coup currently being plotted by his closest friends , shooting himself , committing suicide in a bunker , dying in a massacre or leaving the country , as many dictators have done , and being taken to live in exile somewhere else .
This is our proposal , the alternative to war , as I have told Mr Cohn-Bendit too , and , more specifically : ' temporary government ' - in inverted commas - by the UN for two or three years until fundamental rights are established in that country - using Amartya Sen 's economics and other methods ; there have been temporary governments in Japan , Germany and other places - governments with the task of restoring to the Iraqi citizens and the Middle East the rights which have been taken from them through violence .
This is our proposal , and may the others rest in eternal peace .
I believe that we are choosing something different : living in freedom , according to the law , building a life which is worthy of being lived and consists of more than just constant dread of the terror of death .
Mr President , I would like to join several other speakers in expressing satisfaction at the conclusions of the General Affairs Council and praising those people who have been involved in this agreement .
But we naturally hope for more and we therefore ask that work continue in order to achieve a fundamental consensus between the European Union 's current four representatives on the United Nations Security Council , in the hope that the four will act , at least , in a coordinated fashion .
But I believe that that consensus demands at least two things : the first is not to publicise unilateral positions but to debate them with our partners and the second is to be loyal - but not copycats - to our natural allies .
Because although it seems obvious , we must remember that in this conflict the person who is threatening world peace , failing to comply with international law and presenting us with the real risk that international terrorists may acquire chemical and bacteriological weapons is Saddam Hussein .
And it does not take any great feat of memory to conclude that the only language the Iraqi Government understands from the international community is firmness .
And this firmness is not credible if we say beforehand that in no event , whatever happens , can the use of force be justified , as the President of my group quite rightly said .
This is not pacifism , it is demagoguery and irresponsibility .
In order to genuinely work for peace , what we have to do is act decisively against violations of international law and against repeated non-compliance with the resolutions of the United Nations .
We believe that the European Union should continue to explore all political and diplomatic avenues in order to resolve the conflict in a peaceful manner , with our allies , as is natural , and also , and in particular , with our friends , the Arab nations .
I would remind you of the unanimous support of the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council for Resolution 1441 , because this is not a religious conflict or a conflict between civilisations - incidentally , it would be good to take this opportunity to relaunch Euro-Mediterranean relations .
In order to be credible , the European Union must be prepared to make its contribution to guaranteeing and preserving international peace and security .
The inspectors ' reports to the Security Council are conclusive in terms of the non-compliance with Resolution 1441 .
They are not being given the required assistance to carry out their work and they are not being given the evidence to show that weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated , and the simple fact that terrorist groups may acquire these weapons should be cause for alarm on the part of the international community .
The Iraqi regime today has a new opportunity ; let us pray that it takes that opportunity and that we can all prevent anything worse from happening .
But if the Iraqi Government persists in ignoring the requirements demanded of it , not for just a month or two , but since April 1991 , when Resolution 687 was adopted , democratic parliaments such as the European Parliament must demand of the executive powers that they meet their responsibilities .
Democratic and responsible governments must not make decisions on the basis of opinion polls , which are variable , but by informing the public , engaging in political debate but defending the higher principles at stake , such as international peace and security , not the price of oil .
And periodically , by means of democratic elections , the citizens will judge whether the governments , and also the oppositions , have made the right decisions .
Mr President , 72 % of my compatriots are against a war in Iraq .
They have not yet seen any convincing evidence .
They are concerned about the human suffering , the increasing South-North divide that will increase hatred amongst people and hinder democratisation and solutions in the Middle East .
The fear is that fundamentalists of all hues will use and abuse the opportunity to determine our world agenda , which will result in the opposite of world peace , stability and justice .
In a world in which oil prices are rising and the chance of peace is falling , it is the developing countries with no oil that are the main victims .
The gap will grow .
The international coalition against international terrorism is being undermined .
Whoever tries to oust Saddam through war without convincing evidence , without a UN resolution and therefore without public opinion on their side , is undermining the international rule of law .
Europeans are not at all convinced .
That is why the European members of the UN Security Council must exert maximum pressure on Saddam to answer Blix 's questions without making the mistake of falling into an unregulated and improper war .
Germany , Britain , France and Spain must all listen to their people and not to the fundamentalist Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz in George Bush 's circle .
There have fortunately been many protests from the American people , and a large number of Democrats have rejected the logic of inevitable war .
We are looking for allies among the American people , the majority of whom are not in favour of a unilateral war .
We reject the logic of inevitable war .
The dictator Saddam must fear the wrath of the whole world , but this must be aimed at allowing him to cooperate peacefully in finding answers and not in another Bay of Pigs or another Tonkin incident .
And if Bush ultimately comes up with the evidence which he has been repeatedly promising us and which Blix has also urgently requested , that is not a reason for war but , on the contrary , to inspect through the UN and then to tackle and eliminate the problems .
The power of a united Security Council must bring Saddam to his knees , and we must take time to do that .
We have the time , Saddam does not .
A war without convincing evidence or a UN resolution would be an admission of weakness and would really play into the hands of the Saddams of this world .
Let us Europeans , via you , Mr Solana , the 15 Member States and the Security Council , build on our European peoples ' desire for peace .
That is true wisdom .


Mr President , may we ask what Mr Solana and Mr Patten are doing to translate into action their professed will to avoid war , beyond reassessing the need to disarm the awful Iraqi regime , beyond formally relying on the Security Council to do so or even trusting Mr Powell to testify as an eye witness that Bin Laden has been bedding with Saddam Hussein ?
The problem is that the decision to bomb Iraq into a morgue unfit for the dead was taken a long time ago on the Potomac .
People all over the world have understood this and are angry and are mobilising against it .
It is all very well to say that we must announce the role of the United Nations .
But , may I ask , who is demeaning that role and proclaiming every day that , with or without the United Nations , war will be unleashed , probably by 6 March 2003 , whatever the Security Council may or may not say ?
Regarding solid evidence , we do not know for sure if this bloody dictator still has these awful weapons and neither does Dr Blix .
What the United States is asking from Saddam Hussein , however , is not to prove his innocence but to provide evidence of his own guilt , that is , to put his own neck in the noose to be hanged or be bombed to smithereens .
If this were a criminal case , it would be thrown out of any court in this world .
So , to adapt the words of Mr Solana and Mr Patten , there is quite a lot of ambiguity , obfuscation and the undeclared will to follow the warmongering lead of Washington , hoping only that the United Nations will provide the desired fig leaf .
This , we must say , probably for the last time , is a defining moment for Europe .
This Union must reclaim the moral and rational initiative and , first of all , save itself from some of its leaders .
Mr President , we all agree that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his own people .
But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world , and making their voice heard , consider that George W. Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large .
There is no justification for this war in my opinion or in the opinion of the protestors .
I repeat yet again that there is no evidence whatsoever of a link between Al Qaida and Iraq .
Washington 's claims are based on Al Qaida prisoners in Guantanamo Bay .
We all know what those prisoners are suffering .
There was never for one moment any doubt in my mind that the United States has been angling for war in Iraq .
The fact that 1.7 million citizens have died as a result of sanctions and bombings since the Gulf War makes one wonder how much a barrel of oil is worth .
Make no mistake , this war is about oil .
We are told by the United States that the oil reserves after the war will be used exclusively for Iraqi reconstruction .
I say to Mr Bush : pull my other leg !
Just look at the United States ' contributions to the reconstruction of Afghanistan .
The European Union is footing that particular bill .
Society in Afghanistan remains as fractured as ever .
In my view , the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security .
Without the agreement of the UN Security Council , this war would be a breach of international law , would have no legitimacy and would be wholly immoral .
More than 80 % of European people are against war in Iraq .
Yet they are ignored by American and British leaders who are busy sending troops in preparation for the war .
So much for democracy .
I believe that , after Iraq , the Americans will move on to Iran and the other elements of the axis of evil .
Truly a war of civilisations .
May God helps us all !
Mr President , I belong to that generation of Europeans which has always , not least because of the period of history we have lived through , seen the United States as our champion of democracy and freedom , the country which freed Italy and Europe from Nazi tyranny , the country which , for decades , led the Western democracies in the fight against the threats posed by the Soviet Union .
I am sad and concerned to see the United States now taking a path which is likely to lose it the moral leadership of the world , although it will , of course , still have political and military leadership .
Indeed , we have shifted from a firm , rational position in the face of the dangers of Arab and Islamic terrorism and the terrorism of Iraq itself to a situation of unilateral decisions , and we must realise that we cannot accept this situation without undoing decades of progress made in international law .
What will we do if , in the future , a country such as China or Russia decides it has the right to invade one of its neighbours ?
Is Iraq really the most dangerous threat or is Korea not evidence of the existence of greater threats ?
That is why , while confirming our great affection and esteem for the United States , we must now tell it , as its true allies and friends , that it has taken the wrong road and must stop and listen to the international community .
Furthermore , my regret is increased by the state of Europe , at the sight of a Europe divided as never before , in which the genuine problems - the lack of a political , strategic vision of the world - are starkly revealed and in which the legitimate , rightful diversities of the European countries are made worthless by their inability to agree on joint measures .
I welcome the Franco-German cooperation , although I do not support all the positions .
I welcome it because it has always been the driving force of Europe and can continue to be so in the future , but , if we do not want it to be restricted to what is quite simply irrelevant rhetoric , as has been the case thus far , it must be channelled into a position which will result in the creation of a European defence policy in the future , for only when Europe speaks with one voice will it become as influential as the United States .
Mr President , in the light of the UN inspectors ' report to the UN Security Council on Monday , and ten years of Iraq 's deception , evasion and non-compliance with Security Council resolutions , it should be clear to everybody here that we are facing a very grave situation in the Gulf .
The starting point in this whole debate must be that we are representatives of democratic nations .
Saddam Hussein is a dictator who has no respect for democracy , for the rule of law or for the demands of the United Nations itself .
As democrats we have a responsibility to explain fully the reasons why it may be necessary to take action in order to uphold the will of the international community , which is that Saddam Hussein should unconditionally disarm .
This issue is not simply about the work of UN inspectors ; rather , it is about disarming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction .
These weapons were there when the inspectors had to leave in 1999 - where are they now ?
There has to date been no evidence of disarmament ; and let us never forget : the burden of proof here must be with Saddam .
In my view , the British Prime Minister has a special responsibility to explain clearly the reasons why we must confront the threat from Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
Sadly I must say that , to date , his own government has not been as united and clear on this issue as I feel we in the United Kingdom are entitled to expect .
We are disappointed at Mr Blair 's inability to sufficiently persuade public opinion in the United Kingdom of the need to be prepared to take action , in the face of what is very clearly a real threat to the security of our people .
In the United Kingdom we have seen during the course of the last fortnight or so very clear instances of the existence of that real threat .
A collective failure to confront the gravity of the situation with unity and with determination only gives Saddam Hussein succour ; not to be prepared to take action - if he continues to obstruct and to lie - would be an open invitation to any rogue state to do anything it likes and still not face serious consequences .
It would also leave the United States itself , and the United Nations particularly , weak and impotent .
Clearly , should the situation not improve in the weeks ahead , a second UN resolution may be required .
That is , however , the optimum option ahead of any military engagement in the Gulf .
Having listened to General Morillon , I take the view that the international Community still has the right to act without any such new resolution , as the powers are already vested in earlier UN resolutions .
The position of the French and German Governments in recent days , as well as many of the contributions and demonstrations that have been made in this Chamber this afternoon , clearly show that any prospect of a common foreign and security policy is fallacious .
I do not make any partisan political point on this , but we are surely fooling ourselves as European Parliamentarians if we believe that we are anywhere near developing a common foreign and security policy or anything like it - we clearly are not .
In the days and weeks ahead , we need steady nerves and an effective United Nations .
We must ensure Saddam Hussein understands that his failure to comply with the will of the international community will result in serious consequences .
Equally , we must also ensure that public opinion in the West and elsewhere understands and appreciates why we must be prepared to take action in defence of the international interest .
Political leaders must have the courage to face up to such threats ; otherwise the credibility of the United Nations itself will be at stake and Saddam Hussein will have prevailed .
If the western nations had sent a stronger and more unified message to Saddam Hussein from the start and maintained their resolve , then perhaps we would not have to be contemplating military intervention today .
Mr President , there have been times in recent months when I have felt that we are conducting politics through the looking-glass , where all the norms are reversed and black has become white , so I think it is quite useful for us to get back to basics .
First of all , the United States of America is a democratic country which twice in the last century was prepared to lay down the lives of its citizens to defend peace , freedom and democracy in Europe .
Iraq is a country ruled by a dictatorship , where there is neither freedom nor democracy , and whose leaders murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens and is known to be a threat to peace and stability in the region .
It is not the other way round .
It is also worth remembering exactly what resolution 1441 actually says .
Paragraph 1 states that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations under UN resolutions .
Paragraph 4 states that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq 's obligations .
Finally , Paragraph 13 recalls that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations .
Given Hans Blix 's report , it could be argued that Paragraph 4 has already been breached .
Whatever is the case , the UN has to decide what it means by Paragraph 13 and by serious consequences .
Colleagues who have spoken are right that the future of the UN is at stake .
The UN cannot make threats without being prepared to carry them out .
The inspectors need more time and we need more information from the Americans .
But if further serious breaches are reported , resolution 1441 has to be followed through .
Failure to do so will only sanction the very illegal activity we have condemned , and it seems to me that some of the contributions today are attacks on UN resolution 1441 which we are all supporting .
No member of the Security Council should prejudge that debate ; nor should they say now how they are going to vote before they see the evidence .
But we must be clear that , if a second resolution is forthcoming from the UN , we must all support it because that is what we have stated very clearly in our resolutions in this Parliament .
Mr President , everybody knows that we are currently on the brink of disaster .
The US Government , taking advantage of the terrorist acts of 11 September , is now imposing State terrorism on the entire world with the aim of establishing its economic and military domination everywhere .
Not content to allow the Palestinian people to be massacred , to allow 500 000 Iraqi children to die due to the embargo and millions of Africans with AIDS to die due to lack of care , President Bush is going to invade Iraq in order , in particular , to appropriate its oil .
Who can seriously believe for one second that the United States want to oppose a terrorist dictatorship because it fails to respect UN decisions ?
We should not forget that Pinochet and Bin Laden were agents recruited and trained by the CIA , that Israel has never applied a single UN resolution and that fortunately , however , nobody is considering bombing Israel .
Human rights or profits : two weights , two measures .
That is the choice .
This war smells of oil , and the majority in this House knows it .
Without providing any support for Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship , it is our duty to pass on the mass rejection of the people which will be expressed in particular in all the capital cities on 15 February in response to the Porto Alegre forum .
With or without the UN , this war is not ours .
According to estimates , it will cost almost USD 30 billion , while the UN food programme , under pressure from the United States , has just been reduced to USD 1.7 billion .
Rejecting the war by every possible means , using the sums allocated to war to eradicate poverty , and allowing the Palestinian people to live in a free State : those are the three imperatives of the moment .
Mr President , it is vitally important that the European Parliament sends a very clear message that there is no case for military action in Iraq .
Increasing numbers of people across the EU recognise that such a pre-emptive attack would be both illegal and immoral .
Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for anti-war demonstrations across the European Union .
In the United Kingdom , over 160 000 people have signed a petition against war organised by a national newspaper , the Daily Mirror .
They recognise that you cannot say you are upholding international law by breaking international law .
They know that a war against Iraq would also be hugely counter-productive - far from fighting terrorism , it is a sure-fire way to fuel terrorism .
There are alternatives and the EU has a key role to play in promoting them .
If this conflict is really about getting rid of weapons of mass destruction , there are many other routes we can take .
We need full implementation , for example , of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Five countries , including Britain , France and the United States , have been in material breach of this particular article of international law for over three decades .
The chemical and biological conventions could also be strengthened .
There are many other proposals .
There are ambitious and controversial agendas , but the EU is uniquely able to propose radical new solutions and it has a duty to do so .
Mr President , we are all agreed that every endeavour must be made to safeguard peace and that it is the duty of all of us to strive to avoid war .
I share the anti-war sentiments , but it is precisely in order to avoid war that the international community must identify with the United Nations Organisation and its decisions , thus giving authority to the role of the United Nations .
The decisions taken by the UN thus far have been very clear , Mr President , starting with the message sent to Saddam Hussein calling for the disarmament of all weapons of mass destruction .
If Iraq does not respect the wishes of the international community , an armed intervention , which , of course , may only follow a UN decision , will be inevitable .
Now the ball is in the Iraqi dictator 's court .
It is now up to Saddam Hussein to prove to the world that he does not have prohibited weapons .
If he genuinely wants to prevent war , he must tell the inspectors the truth .
I regret to say that , thus far , Saddam Hussein has been uncooperative towards the UN representatives , as is shown by Hans Blix 's report to the Security Council which expresses clear suspicions regarding nerve gas and chemical bombs .
I quote : ' On 7th of December , 2002 , Iraq submitted a declaration of some 12,000 pages ? [ to ] ? the Security Council . ?
Regrettably , the 12 000-page declaration , most of which is a reprint of earlier documents , does not seem to contain any new evidence that will eliminate the questions or reduce their number . '
The same applies to nerve gas .
Iraq promised that the poisonous substance had not been deployed for use as a weapon , yet UNMOVIC has managed to obtain information to the contrary : there are indications that Iraq has produced more than it declared and that nerve gas has been deployed for military purposes .
I will cite once again the report submitted to the Security Council in relation to chemical bombs : there is a discrepancy of 6 500 bombs .
I repeat : 6 500 chemical bombs remain unaccounted for .
Then Iraq has declared that it produced about 8 500 litres of anthrax , which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991 .
Iraq - the report continues - has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction . There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared .
The report continues in this vein .
Today , I am pleased to say , Saddam Hussein is isolated .
In addition to this , the statement made by Mr Putin yesterday calling upon the Iraqi dictator to cooperate with the inspectors , failing which Russia would be forced to change its position , must not be underestimated .
The pressure on Saddam Hussein must be intensified .
I am therefore appealing to the Members of the European Parliament who are thinking of going to Iraq to give up their plan .
Saddam Hussein would use their mission to claim that Europe is divided and that he has some supporters in our continent .
This exploitation must be avoided at all costs .
Whether we choose war or peace now depends first and foremost on the decisions Saddam Hussein makes , and Europe must ensure that the Iraqi regime cooperates with the inspectors .
In this extremely problematic situation , Europe 's duty is to use its influence to further peace .
The Union 's document , approved by the Foreign Affairs Ministers the other day , is evidence that divisions can be avoided in our continent , divisions which Saddam Hussein could exploit to gain time and to create further setbacks for the United Nations .
By speaking with one voice , Europe has persuaded the United States to accept the postponement of war and has given the inspectors more influence .
The Old Continent can do a great deal to achieve peace , and this is why the initiatives being taken by the Italian Government at this time deserve our close attention and support too .
The interviews and meetings - held today , tomorrow and on Monday - could prove to be extremely significant , not least in that I believe the Italian Government is conveying messages from the other countries of the European Union .
The active quest for peace must not , however , Mr President , cause us to forget that we are all committed to safeguarding the values of freedom , tolerance and respect for human dignity , values which suffered attack on September 11 .
It is not just the United States which suffered - each one of us has been affected .
Now , it is up to Saddam Hussein to prove that he is not supporting terrorism , that he has no dealings with Al Qaida and that he intends to bow to the will of the United Nations .
In short , it is he who will be responsible for what happens in the coming months .
Mr President , the High Representative started his speech this evening by saying that we must tackle this crisis from a European perspective .
All credit is due to him , but we must also acknowledge the work of the Greek Presidency , which played this card determinedly and , thus far , has obtained hitherto unhoped-for results , especially as regards the agenda and the time frames .
In this connection , I would remind you that Korea , the Middle East and Macedonia were discussed as well as Iraq , for they are all part of a very complex international situation .
I believe that Parliament will have no difficulty in supporting you , Mr Solana , on the four points you cited as European strategy .
I would make it clear that , as regards the role of the United Nations , we - the Group of the European Socialists , in particular - want there to be neither excessive rigidity in the implementation of Resolution 1441 nor , should there prove to be a discrepancy between statements and reality , an automatic declaration of war .
However , to lend credibility to the desire - which you have rightly described as the desire of the majority of the European citizens - to both avoid war and be without dictators , I believe that Europe must have more confidence in itself and be more coherent and , above all , more united .
More coherent in the sense of believing more strongly in its values and showing some pride in them and more united in the sense of adopting a better thought out , consistent position .
In this regard , I would like to end with a question .
Are this document , adopted on 27 January by the Foreign Affairs Ministers , and the coordination of the European Members of the Security Council an indication that the opposing Franco-German and Anglo-Spanish positions will be resolved ?
Then , what will Italy - the subject of such eulogies from Mr Tajani - do when it has the Presidency ?
How much continuity can there be between the Greek and Italian Presidencies , given that our Prime Minister oscillates continuously between support for President Bush and what then appears to be a preference for the European position ?
Mr President , the twisted war mentality that the US administration has developed is extremely serious and warrants the increasing opposition of world public opinion .
As emphasised by the representatives of many countries at the world parliamentary forum in Porto Alegre , we must call on our leaders to firmly oppose the war and reject the concept of preventive war contained in the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration .
The institutions of the European Union , and the governments of the Member States and candidate countries must reject all and any participation in the war against Iraq , including the use of military bases and other facilities on their territory , and reject any participation of soldiers or the provision of military and financial resources , without this implying any support for the Iraqi regime .
We must also ensure that the embargo on Iraq is ended , an embargo that has caused so much harm to the population , particularly to children .
What is particularly important are all actions demonstrating solidarity with the Iraqi people , such as visits to Iraq by delegations of Members of the European Parliament and the public demonstrations against the war and to defend peace planned for 15 February .
We must reject this unjust war , which is clearly a statement of the United States ' hegemony , essentially dictated by oil interests and American and British military and industrial complexes .
Opposition to the war in Iraq is equally crucial in order to put an end to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories and to the aggression by Ariel Sharon 's government and to attempt to achieve , by means of dialogue , a fair and lasting peace .
Our citizens want peace , so let us all work to make this possible , repeatedly expressing our protests , indignation and rejection with regard to the imminence of a new war against Iraq .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , America is afraid .
It has been afraid since 11 September .
It has waged war on every continent . It has little experience of war on its own soil ; the last time was in the 1860s .
Therefore it is afraid , and when a country or a continent is afraid , it can make stupid mistakes .
America should listen to old Europe , this wise old lady , covered in blood and tears , the old lady that America itself came to save from dictatorship fifty years ago .
Let America listen to her !
This old lady would say : choose security through international law , bow to the decisions of the UN , agree to another UN meeting , which we must demand , for another resolution .
We know the Americans are the strongest .
We are forced to take note of it .
That is no reason to be unilateral .
That is no reason to stand firm on your own national interests alone .
It must be said that our fellow citizens can detect a strong smell of oil in this matter .
Some will say that this is untrue , but they can smell it and they know that three quarters of oil stocks are there , that America needs them , that tomorrow China will need them ; they know that these stocks , these resources , must be made available for the development of our countries , certainly , but also the southern countries .
These are world stocks for everyone , and first of all also for those countries .
Lastly , a final word to young Europe , our Europe , this young girl that we are creating .
This will be her hour of truth and we must harmonise the positions of her four Member States and one candidate country that are on the Security Council .
What took place on Monday is not enough .
We should be able to coordinate our position to decide together what we are going to do with our two rights of veto in the Security Council , anticipating what might be our future .
In any case , there is no clear reason to give up , whether with regard to the meeting or the right of veto .
Mr President , the United Nations inspectors in Iraq are doing a good job .
If they find undeclared chemical or biological weapons , they have the right to destroy them .
If they do not find any , their duty is to pass on this information .
While this process is underway and provided that it produces the anticipated result , Iraq does not represent a threat to anyone .
In its current situation , it would not even dare to set off a firecracker .
There is therefore no reason to instigate a pre-emptive war .
In the next few days , the States of the European Union therefore have a pressing duty to prevent unilateral military action in defiance of international law .
Resolution 1441 excludes automatic recourse to the use of force .
It is a shame , therefore , that the ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE should have chosen to be ambiguous on this fundamental point .
Have they not read the statement from the Episcopalian conference of German bishops , which says , and I quote : ' a pre-emptive war is an attack and cannot be considered a just war ' ?
I do not think the bishops have been manipulated by Saddam Hussein .
Have our fellow Members in the PPE-DE not understood the churches ' call to try everything to prevent a pre-emptive war which , and I quote : ' would remove all content from the principle of non-recourse to force laid down by international law and at the end of the day would weaken the whole system of the Community between the States ' ?
The socialists cannot express better than the bishops what they think of the war cries from the Washington hawks .
There is still time for the Christian-Democrat Members to recover , tomorrow , at the vote , and I am sure that Mr Morillon , who is a reasonable man , will use all his powers of persuasion .
Mr President , High Representative , almost everything has been said today .
I would like to welcome the efforts of the Greek Presidency to resolve the situation we find ourselves in .
The European Parliament will perhaps adopt a common resolution tomorrow on Iraq , a resolution which I support .
But I am appalled that the minimal consensus it reflects , which underlines the central role of the United Nations Security Council , is so timid .
Although defence and security are clearly intergovernmental matters , I believe that world peace and stability cannot be restricted to one pillar .
You have said , Mr Solana , that the overwhelming majority of Europeans are unambiguously against the war .
And we , in this Parliament , in order to safeguard European cohesion and our trans-Atlantic relations , vacillate and pay a high price , that of silence , and at times hypocrisy , since we are pretending to believe certain things . We are pretending to believe that the non-existence of something can be proved .
We are pretending to believe that we are fighting terrorism , when there is every indication that we are going to make it infinitely worse . We are pretending to believe that Iraq is a threat to the world , when actually it is a country on its knees .
We are pretending to believe that only that country has weapons of mass destruction , when the entire region is a powder keg .
We are pretending to believe that the 150 000 men amassed on the borders of Iraq are only there to put pressure on Saddam Hussein .
We are pretending to believe , as Mr Poignant has said , that this war does not have a terrible whiff of oil and that Bush 's real objective is to return Iraq to the Iraqis .
We are also pretending to believe that democracy can be built by force on a site littered with mines and bombs .
And we are pretending to believe that we will never be accomplices in a massacre and that the UN , that arbiter of international law , will play an impartial role and is not subject to horrendous pressures .
Mr President , I am ashamed today !
Mr President , Mr Solana , war is never something inevitable that one just has to resign oneself to .
Man decides to go to war ; and man can put a stop to war .
War can never be the right way to destroy weapons of mass destruction or combat terrorism .
We are on the verge of a war that would have devastating consequences for the people of Iraq , for the whole region and the whole world .
In this situation , we cannot stay silent about the legal and moral problems surrounding a war .
All politicians should analyse what a war with Iraq would lead to .
Millions of people would be forced to flee - refugees that the neighbouring countries cannot take care of .
The war could spread to Israel and Palestine , and opposition to the West could grow , resulting in more terrorist attacks .
Very great humanitarian efforts would be needed for Iraq 's 23 million people .
Is it worth the cost ?
The war with Iraq is not about Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship or breaches of UN resolutions .
If that were the case , the USA , the UN and the EU would be involved in many wars all over the world : for example , in Saudi Arabia and Israel , to name but a few .
What it is really about is power over oil and power in the region .
The United Nations Charter permits the use of force for the preservation of peace only as a last resort , when all other options have been exhausted .
Only the Security Council can make decisions on this .
Neither the United Nations Charter nor international law permits the use of force for preventive purposes , however .
A preventive war is the law of the street , the justice of the powerful , which sweeps aside the international law on which the world is founded .
The EU must protest strongly against this .
There is no justification for Saddam Hussein 's devastating politics .
His and all other weapons of mass destruction must go , even those in the USA , the UK and Israel , but we have never recommended that force be used to this end .
Give the inspectors a decent amount of time , and use the time for cooperation between the EU , the Arab countries , Russia and the UN to find a peaceful solution .
Mr President , war is a grave thing .
Erasmus said that war is sweet to those who do not know it .
I believe we must condemn those who employ hypocrisy , double standards , half truths and total distortions in order to take us to war .
It is unacceptable to hear prominent speeches which , rather than promoting a genuine fight against terrorism , that is , against Al Qaida , disseminate fallacies about supposed ideologies of power and domination which are equated with militarism , when at the same time the speaker boasts of having the best army in the world .
A little self-analysis on the part of those who accuse the Iraqi dictator of representing a world of constant alarm and chaos would reveal who really represents an ideology of power and domination and who provokes constant alarm in the world .
Nevertheless , I believe we should be pleased to see the continuous growth within the Member States of a movement rejecting war , and positions such as that of General Schwarzkopf who , taking the approach of Erasmus , has just accused the Minister for war , Rumsfeld , of undervaluing the army and of relishing the idea of going to war , or such as that of the Democrat Senator Joseph Biden , who has accused Bush of promoting the greatest wave of anti-Americanism for 30 years .
Furthermore , the Italian Prime Minister , Silvio Berlusconi , has just said that he is in favour of peace but that he cannot share the responsibility for backing down in the face of those who threaten our security , freedom and democracy .
I believe that , with sophisms of this type , it is we who endanger our freedom , our democracy and our principles and of course our security , because a society which allows lies and distortions in order to dominate the oil market and indulge in strategic whims of an imperialist nature weakens itself in the medium term and thereby jeopardises its cohesion and security .
Mr President , I have the justifiable suspicion that with regard to this Iraq crisis , Prime Minister Aznar has made secret commitments of a military nature to the Bush administration .
I can provide the European Parliament with proof of this in the form of a series of significant public statements by Prime Minister Aznar in Spain , in which he demonstrates through the media his unconditional support for Bush , including for a unilateral attack .
Does this attitude show loyalty to the European Union ?
Is this position which breaks European consensus loyal ?
Are these televised comments by Aznar in which he states that he will back Bush unconditionally in a unilateral attack loyal ?
Are they loyal , given that we know that that would violate international law and the United Nations Charter ?
I would also like to make it clear , Mr President , that not even his own country supports him in this , and that it does not support these positions .
The enormous majority of Spanish society is against a unilateral attack .
Spain opposed the unilateral attack on Libya and on Panama at the time and now it fully supports the common European position .
Representatives of the Council and the Commission , has Prime Minister Aznar informed you of his unconditional unilateral support for Bush ?
With regard to Mr Galeote 's recommendations , they would be cynical if they are not first applied to Aznar .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the many honourable Members who have accompanied me during this sitting for their tenacity and perseverance .
Thank you .
I would like to speak briefly , without exceeding the time allotted to me , to explain various issues .
Firstly , there can be no doubt that this is a difficult debate .
It is a debate which goes to the heart of the European Union 's foreign policy and beyond .
We have a new world situation which may undoubtedly have consequences for the future which are hard to predict today .
But I would like to say that we must not indulge in a sort of pessimism about the European Union 's inability to reach common positions .
We are talking about such serious issues as war and peace .
We are talking about something extremely grave ; life or death .
And it is therefore natural that so many Members of Parliament have spoken in very different ways and that the governments have also at times said so many differing things .
Hence the first consequence ; it will be very difficult to take a decision on war and peace , on life and death , by means of a vote on one particular day .
Peace and war , life and death , belong to the States and one State will never be prepared to allow another State to impose on it the obligation to go to war or , conversely , to impose that obligation to go to war on another .
I say this within the context of the European Union .
On the second issue , I believe that if we cast our minds back to the end of August and the beginning of September of last year , I believe that the majority of Members of this honourable Parliament thought , with fear or horror , that we were at the beginning of a unilateral action against Iraq .
There was pressure , very significant pressure from many countries , the majority of countries of the European Union .
And we should also recognise the courage of the British Prime Minister , Mr Tony Blair , at that time .
Amongst all of us we managed to ensure that that operation , which appeared to be under way , was brought within the context of the United Nations .
And in September of that year the Iraq dossier , which was kept outside the United Nations Security Council , outside the framework of the United Nations , was brought to the United Nations .
And for seven long weeks Resolution 1441 was debated .
All of this action was unquestionably led by European countries in order to achieve a unanimously approved Resolution .
It has been a long time since a resolution of such importance has been approved unanimously , and countries such as Syria , for example , and a few days later , as I said at the beginning , the Arab League , the Arab countries , unanimously supported the content of Resolution 1441 .
I do not believe that the Europeans are the only people responsible for Resolution 1441 , but it would be pessimistic for us not to say that we have been very instrumental in the existence of Resolution 1441 .
So let us reassess our feelings of pessimism or optimism : our actions have been significant and they continue to be so .
Resolution 1441 obliged the inspectors , Dr Blix and Mr ElBaradei , to produce a report .
They were kind enough to speak with the President of the European Parliament yesterday by videoconference .
The Members of this Parliament are well informed about what Mr Blix thinks .
You have an in-depth knowledge of what he thinks , not only from what he has said in public , but also from what he said in that videoconference .
And all the honourable Members of this House know that Dr Blix , a great European by the way - as he said himself yesterday ? and a man who believes in the values of Europe , spoke to you yesterday with a degree of pessimism in his heart .
This pessimism was not the result of ignorance , since he is a wise man , who has worked on the inspection of weapons of mass destruction for many years .
He was somewhat pessimistic because he recognised that there had not been the cooperation he had hoped for .
He had hoped , with his skill , his experience and generosity , for greater cooperation .
So , the first consequence we have in our hands , the first report , is a report which does not satisfy us in terms of the cooperation between Saddam Hussein and his regime and the inspectors .
But despite all of this , we must continue and we have therefore asked the countries of the European Union to give all possible assistance to the inspectors .
And I insist : what kind of assistance can we give ?
There are three types : assistance in terms of time , giving them more time ; material assistance , giving them more resources if they need them ; and assistance in terms of information and intelligence .
Another achievement yesterday was that the evidence in existence which was not being distributed beyond a certain number of people , some of them amongst Dr Blix 's colleagues , will now be discussed on 5 February within the United Nations Security Council .
The United Nations Security Council is still , therefore , the centre of gravity of the debate , and I believe that the countries of Europe have had a hand in this , not in every respect , but to a very considerable extent .
There is therefore a dynamic of pressure which must be maintained - and the inspectors are asking us to maintain it ? and at the same time a political dynamic in the debate taking place in the Security Council , which will take time .
There will be other sittings and no doubt this Parliament will analyse within a few days the reports which will be produced in the United Nations Security Council .
On the 14 February there will be a second report from the inspectors and we will see how the situation is developing .
As the honourable Members may imagine , I am in constant contact with many people , with many important countries in the Security Council , and with non-European countries and non-members of the Security Council .
The honourable Members will remember , because you follow this issue as closely as I do , that a few days ago in Ankara there was an important meeting of the most significant Arab countries .
I would urge you to read the declaration which emerged from that meeting .
That declaration is not so different from the European Union 's declaration on Monday , quite the contrary , although it is perhaps less forceful .
We are therefore working in the right direction .
Will we achieve a good outcome ?
We will see , but we have a political dynamic which nobody would have expected a few months ago .
We must therefore continue working , continue cooperating in this way with the other members of the Security Council , we must continue working with the other countries and amongst ourselves so that , at the end of this journey , we may have , as I said at the beginning , a solution to this extremely serious conflict .
Because there is absolutely no doubt that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is going to be the great issue which we Europeans are going to have to deal with in the coming years and we will have to genuinely take on board the importance of this issue .
And I believe that we are sometimes not sufficiently awake to the possible consequences of this , but I hope that in this case it is resolved and that the solution is a good one .
In any event , for my part , I will always be prepared to appear before this Parliament , however many Members are in attendance , in order to try to move forward and overcome the difficulties facing all of us at this historic moment for good or for bad .
Let us hope that it is for good .
I have received six motions for resolutions
The European Parliament must speak out clearly against war as a means of disarming Iraq , because the vast majority of our citizens is against it .
The UN has shown the way : by forcing disarmament through inspections and demanding answers to the inspectors ' questions .
All further action must take place within the framework of the UN .
Human rights remain a dead letter in other countries as well ; other countries also have weapons of mass destruction - Iran , Pakistan , North Korea and India for example .
It is inconceivable that a superpower would be able to unilaterally solve the problem by military means .
The fact that Iraq has been weakened by the Gulf War ten years ago and has oil wells does not justify making an exception to this .
There are many other problems waiting to be resolved , such as the Palestine issue , the Middle East , Kashmir and so on .
It is not only the Kurds in Iraq who are waiting for recognition of their rights as a people , but also those in Syria , Turkey and Iran .
The pressure on Saddam must be maintained until the regime falls or conforms with the international rule of law .
Arming a dictator , as the Russians and the Americans but also the British , French and Germans did with Saddam during his war with Iran , is costly in the long term .
The road to a durable peace must be coupled with disarmament and development .
The oil in Iraq changes nothing .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the withdrawal of North Korea from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Mr Yiannitsis , the President-in-Office of the Council , has the floor to make his statement .
Mr President , just three years ago we all hoped that the Korean peninsular could look forward to a much better future .
North Korea , traditionally isolated from just about every other country and consistently hostile to South Korea , had for some years been in very severe economic difficulties and eventually Pyongyang was forced to call upon the international community for assistance with food and medical supplies and for help in tackling the effects of a series of disastrous floods .
The international community responded and , in the wake of that , the mood of the regime in Pyongyang seemed to soften , raising the prospect of some change , however slow .
In South Korea , the election of Kim Dae-jung as president in the late 1990s meant that the economic crisis there was tackled effectively and also resulted in efforts to implement the sunshine policy of trying to achieve normalisation of relations with North Korea .
The summit meeting in Pyongyang in 2000 between President Kim Dae-jung and North Korea 's Chairman Kim Jong-il encouraged hopes of further constructive developments .
Against that background , the majority of our Member States who had not already done so established or restored diplomatic links with North Korea and agreed to increase assistance , with a promise of more , if North Korea continued its cautious opening to the outside world .
The high level EU visit led by Prime Minister Goran Persson to Pyongyang in May 2001 was regarded as a further important step that reinforced our nascent dialogue concerning , inter alia , human rights , and brought from North Korea a promise of a continued moratorium on missile testing .
Since then , however , progress has not been so evident .
Political level contact between North Korea and South Korea continued , as did family reunions and business contacts , but the promised second summit did not take place .
Hopes of reconciliation are kept alive , but the patrol boat clash last summer shows how fragile those hopes are .
With the visit of Prime Minster Koizumi to Pyongyang last August , Japan also took a major step forward in opening up dialogue about normalising relations , nearly sixty years after the end of the Japanese occupation of Korea .
But the admission by Chairman Kim Jong-il that over the years Japanese citizens had been kidnapped and that , tragically , some of the abducted people had died in North Korea understandably caused emotional reactions in Japan .
All that has generated justified concern , but it is the deterioration in the relationship with the United States that has generated most worry .
The initial determination of the Bush administration not to follow the policies of President Clinton in relations with North Korea fed Pyongyang 's suspicions that the United States was implacably hostile .
The antagonisms have obviously been increased by the discovery last November that North Korea has been carrying out a covert programme of uranium enrichment in violation of the engagements it undertook in 1994 under the agreed framework , when the Korean Energy Development Organisation ( KEDO ) was set up to ensure that nuclear energy supplies to the DPRK under international supervision reduced the risk of war .
We all , I am sure , share anxiety about the developments over the past two months .
North Korea is now the only country ever to have left the non-proliferation treaty .
It expelled the IAEA inspectors and said it was restarting plutonium production at Yongbyong .
Clearly , if North Korea begins to process significant quantities of plutonium for military use , the situation would deteriorate quickly and seriously .
That reality is understood by all our partners and , of course , not least , the United States .
This is not however just an issue between the DPRK and the United States .
It is a regional issue which carries grave risks for both Korea and Japan .
It is also a crisis with global impact in terms of the non-proliferation worries which it raises .
Clearly , if the situation worsens , there are likely to be adverse economic effects on the global economy including the European Union .
The development crisis therefore calls for common efforts by the main partners to find a diplomatic solution which can satisfy the demands of the international community , including the European Union , that North Korea must return to conformity with the non-proliferation treaty and which also gives North Korea the assurance that it will not be attacked by the United States .
Plainly , if the international community is once again willing to help North Korea to address its enormous internal problems of shortages of energy , food and all other basic needs , this could also assist to get the country out of the crisis .
But it is also clear that the European Union is not a major participant in the affairs of that region .
We are of course a significant participant ; we have provided nearly 300 million euros in different types of aid to the DPRK since the mid-1990s .
Our most significant contribution politically is our participation in the KEDO , where we are board members together with the United States , the Republic of Korea and Japan , and contribute 20 million euros annually .
The European Union has also consistently been involved as a humanitarian donor - a role that was symbolised most recently by the 9.5 million ECU emergency food aid package for nursing mothers .
This is assisted and delivered through the World Food Programme , as much of our humanitarian food assistance has been over the years , and the conditions for doing this are very clearly spelt out in a way that creates very tight monitoring procedures .
The European Union , for this and other reasons , has some credibility vis-à-vis the DPRK .
We can consequently raise the question of whether the European Union can find an effective role in persuading the DPRK to see reason and back down from its current threatening posture and in helping to promote a diplomatic solution , particularly in a way that helps the United States and the DPRK to get back to dialogue and negotiations .
Those were among the issues discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council last Monday , when foreign ministers decided to give a mandate to the Presidency to organise a high level visit to the DPRK .
The timing , composition of the delegation and modalities are to be decided later and preparations for such a visit can now be undertaken .
A clear condition , however , is that the delegation must be received by Chairman Kim Jong-il .
Naturally , in our contact with the DPRK , we will not lose sight of the need for that country to address the human rights abuses that also add to the problem of the dialogue .
I can report that our South Korean friends have pressed strongly for an EU initiative and there has been general encouragement from other partners .
The timing of such a visit must however be decided only after careful consultation with the partners concerned and when we are certain that our delegation will be received at the highest level .
Plainly , we also need to prevent a wedge from being driven between the efforts of the international community to counter the recent DPRK decisions .
Further contact may therefore be needed with our closest allies and the United States in this case in particular .
As the situation develops , the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed .
In the meantime , we hope for the continued and valued support of Parliament in our efforts to foster temperate and constructive attitudes on all sides .
I would end by saying that the world is not in acute need of more conflicts .
Mr President , I have been the co-author of two resolutions in quick succession with Jas Gawronski and Jacques Santer , who are experts on this very isolated country .
North Korea presents one of the most threatening humanitarian crises and military flashpoints on the globe .
Run by a vain and maverick dictator , Kim Jong-il , whose disastrous Stalinist economic policies have brought the country to its knees , the DPRK is now resorting to nuclear blackmail and dangerous brinkmanship with the world community , in breach of the 1994 framework agreement and other previous binding international agreements .
Mr Kim has chosen to withdraw from the NPT and to expel IAEA inspectors , and threatens to reactivate his nuclear weapons programme by switching on the Yongbyong nuclear power station , ostensibly to generate electricity , but no-one is really fooled by this as it is really a source of weapons-grade plutonium for him .
Rather than feed his people , he has chosen to maintain one million men under arms , with an immoral diversion of food and resources to the military , irrespective of the sufferings of the civilian population , many of whom are rotting in political re-education camps or dying of starvation .
North Korea remains a failing , rogue state and a very dangerous one at that .
It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it is technically still at war , and it has ten thousand artillery pieces aimed at Seoul .
I am at a loss as to why out-going President Kim of South Korea is so flattering about his Pyongyang counterpart .
I suppose the sunshine policy requires a very sensitive approach to such a strange man who has just rebuffed the South 's special envoy , Mr Lim , who returned empty-handed yesterday from his trip to the North .
Also , our so-called ally Pakistan needs to consider the consequences of its actions in its alleged provision to North Korea of uranium enrichment technology in exchange for help in weaponising its Ghauri-2 long range missiles with nuclear warheads by adapting North Korean Nodong missiles .
Already many are suspicious of the genuineness of Pakistan 's commitments in its war against terrorism and the disappearance of the records of Pakistan 's relations with North Korea is worrying .
There are also suspicions that both countries are helping Iran 's covert weapons proliferation programme .
The international community must close ranks against this rogue state and stop it becoming a nuclear proliferator if it is not one already , not only because of the threat posed to the South and the 37 000 US troops stationed there , but also the 40 million civilian South Korean population .
It also has a track record , no doubt worsened by its desperate self-inflicted poverty , of exporting arms , including weapons of mass destruction , to any willing buyer irrespective of the danger posed to world security .
In this respect , China and Russia , for once , have a common agenda with the West in preventing a nuclear arms race in the region , which will quickly spread to the South Korean part of the peninsula and to Japan , with very dangerous consequences for the whole world .
The EU must assess the situation carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid .
It must also , however , send a very clear and strong signal to North Korea - which , rather surprisingly , listens carefully to our pronouncements - that it will not tolerate nuclear blackmail in the event of UN sanctions .
It must also urge strongly against any further provocative testing of ballistic missiles over Japan , as happened a couple of years ago , or moving the sealed spent nuclear fuel rods which are currently sitting in water tanks , which therefore would effectively show that they are very serious in their intent to progress to manufacturing plutonium weapons .
The DPRK cannot pursue a policy of ignoring the collective will of the United Nations and must cease its nuclear proliferation immediately .
Mr President , while the entire world is currently focussed on Iraq and the Chamber was full when we talked about it just now , it is the case that the attitude of North Korea is perhaps more worrying and that the danger it poses is very real .
I do not have many real differences with our fellow Members from the PPE-DE on this issue .
North Korea is withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , refusing inspections by the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and re-launching its nuclear programme .
And what are we doing ?
Are we going to threaten war ?
No !
Thank goodness for that and I am glad to see such wisdom .
I entirely agree with the motion for a resolution .
I would like to highlight three points from it .
The first point relates to Pakistan 's role in this issue .
Pakistan is one of our supposed allies , an American ally , which , solely due to the fact that it claims to be fighting terrorism , could , furthermore , without anyone taking any notice , provide North Korea with enriched uranium .
We find this completely unacceptable and it should be condemned .
Secondly , I welcome the decision of the Council and the Commission to also view the North Korean problem from a humanitarian perspective .
From a humanitarian perspective without cutting humanitarian aid , but also trying to find other solutions to the problem of energy , which is a very serious problem in North Korea .
Finally , the point which is probably closest to our hearts , which is dialogue .
We believe it is urgent that we initiate dialogue between the seven major powers , which are the European Union , the United States , Japan , Russia , China , North Korea and South Korea , on economic , security and peace issues .
I believe that it is really this firm dialogue which could lead to a solution to the issue .
Mr President , only two weeks ago North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty , to which it had been a party for 17 years .
This decision was made in a climate of international uncertainty , especially when weapons of mass destruction are concerned .
The threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons is grave and we are currently balancing on the brink of war in Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states .
The North Korean withdrawal is not only a threat to regional stability .
Destabilising the Korean peninsula would have more far-reaching consequences .
Neighbours in far-off countries alike have an interest in making North Korea change its mind .
Besides displaying a lack of respect for international security , the North Korean decision also shows complete disregard for the well-being of an already impoverished population .
Human suffering in North Korea is immense .
Every human right is being violated , including the most fundamental of all : the right to live .
In the past eight years , more than two million people have starved to death in North Korea .
More will suffer the same fate if donors feel forced to restrict aid as a direct consequence of North Korean withdrawal from the NPT .
A concerted effort by regional partners and international organisations is the best way forward .
China , Japan and South Korea along with the United Nations , the EU and the United States should be active in seeking a solution .
The recent resumption of talks between North and South Korea demonstrates that dialogue is possible .
Some groups here have worked together to table a joint resolution expressing a reaction to the current situation in North Korea .
Together we share the view that the North Korean position is untenable .
Besides condemnation and calls for a change of course , we have underlined the need for dialogue and repeated our position on human rights .
North Korea must change its decision for the sake of regional and international stability as well as its own people .
Our joint resolution sends out a clear signal from the vast majority in the Parliament that condemns the current situation and state of affairs in North Korea , but at the same time suggests a course of action which , given the right amount of commitment , could remedy the problem .
Mr President , US President Bush branded North Korea as part of an axis of evil with Iraq and Iran .
These unwise words evidently caused North Korea to believe they were on George Bush 's hit list .
The proliferation of nuclear weapons in east Asia opens up an appalling vista .
This is potentially a much more serious conflict than that in Iraq .
Already last October , the government of North Korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment programme in blatant violation of the KEDO Agreement .
In December , North Korea cancelled its membership of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , expelled the International Atomic Energy Authority weapons inspectors and announced that it would reactivate a nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant producing weapons grade material .
I believe , however , that KEDO was ill designed from the start , neither addressing North Korea 's immediate energy needs , nor delivering technology adaptable to the country 's infrastructure .
The developments on the uranium enrichment programme led the European Parliament in October last year to freeze the EUR 20 million EU contributions to KEDO for 2003 , and the US administration to stop its oil supplies to North Korea under the KEDO Agreement .
It is now inconceivable that Commissioner Patten , as he himself has acknowledged , could come to the European Parliament and request money from the EU funds for nuclear transfers .
Even if he assures this House that the funding will be used for the non-nuclear components of KEDO , the transfer of such technology is now so evidently dangerous that a complete review of KEDO , deleting the nuclear technology transfers , is necessary .
I would ask the Commission to respond to this point in particular , and to ensure that the money be spent on a proposal to provide clean energy from North Korea 's electricity plants , by reconstructing its ancient conventional energy plants so as to make them efficient , by contributing to the proposed gas pipeline from Irkutsk as well as developing the great potential in Korea for wind and solar energy , bio-mass and geothermics .
Mr President , the whole world pays homage to the ' Sun of the 21st century ' , the successor to the ' Great Leader ' .
He only has to threaten and the heads of government come begging for concessions on bended knees .
This is the vague picture of his absolute rule that millions of North Koreans get .
How do we find a sensible answer to the real threat from this tyrannical Sun King ?
The regional leaders appear not to have the power , the will or the opportunity they need to free themselves from the threat of North Korea .
On the other hand , one cannot expect the Americans to solve this global problem alone .
The Security Council is the organ designated to act in this case .
Section 7 of the Charter states that the Council should adopt a resolution that contains clear steps towards de-escalating this dangerous conflict .
The first objective of the EU delegation to Pyongyang must therefore be to bring about discussions with the UN rather than the US .
Mr President , I am pleased to see that both the countries of the European Union and Parliament have achieved a common position on the subject of Korea with less difficulty than they had with regard to Iraq .
I believe that this is proof that the threat of North Korea to world security is seen as greater and more real , as , moreover , both Commissioner Patten and the High Representative , Mr Solana , have said this afternoon .
Clearly , there can be no possibility of military action to destroy nuclear plant in Korea .
In his account of the facts with which we who are concerned with these issues are already quite familiar , the Commissioner mentioned a possible US attack .
I feel that this is to be completely excluded , for it could lead to war , possibly even nuclear war , on the Korean peninsula .
Therefore , unlike in the case of Iraq , here , a peaceful approach is the only possible way forward , and that could take two forms : the isolation of North Korea or diplomacy and an attempt at dialogue .
The United States , which favoured isolation at the start of the crisis , now appears to lean more towards dialogue .
I believe that this is the opinion even of those Members who were here just now but have just left the House holding up placards saying ' No to war ' , not realising that , in doing so , they are making war more likely .
Every initiative which supports Saddam Hussein 's cause makes him more stubborn and less inclined to bow before our requests and pressure .
Now , there are two mistakes we must avoid in negotiations with North Korea .
Firstly , we must not fall into the trap laid by Pyongyang , which is trying to create a division between the United States and South Korea , an attempt which is furthered by the fact that north-south relations have not been very good for some time , to the extent that the outgoing President was moved to describe Kim Jong-Il as a very astute man whereas , judging from what he has done with his country and the way his people , the population live , one might be induced to think the opposite .
Secondly , we must not give other countries , other potential Kim Jong-Il-style dictators - and they do exist - the impression that one only has to violate the non-proliferation treaties in order to be rewarded with support and assistance from the United States .
There must , however , be two indispensable conditions in our negotiations with North Korea .
Firstly , we cannot tolerate the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in that country . Secondly , any agreement must lay down exceedingly rigid , pervasive control measures to prevent North Korea from taking us for a ride once again .
On this basis , the conference we propose in our joint motion for a resolution would be extremely useful as a European Union initiative .
I have received six motions for resolutions
Ladies and gentlemen , I must warn you that we are running late and we will therefore have to administer the debate very strictly .
Since I have no desire to use my repressive powers , I would ask you to administer yourselves in a disciplined fashion .
Mr President , to save time , could you perhaps only give the floor to people who are present in the room during the introductions and who are also willing to listen to the answer .
You might then have fewer problems with the speaking time , and this auditorium would also be better populated ; I am embarrassed on behalf of my fellow MEPs because they are not here to listen to the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner .
Mr President , do the violators of human rights have much to fear and the victims much to expect from the UN Human Rights Commission ?
I do not think so .
The most important forum in the world is once again missing the mark by a mile : it is not the severity of the violations that is the deciding factor but the ability to mobilise political support .
Some countries also manage to repeatedly avoid censure ; this produces a distorted picture of the human rights situation in the world and tarnishes the legitimacy of the Commission .
Regrettably , having a notorious violator of human rights such as Libya as the chairman of the Commission is an example of this .
It is high time for reform that will prevent these kinds of undesirable developments .
The European Union can play a greater role in the UN Commission if it is properly prepared , prepared in time , speaks with one voice and is persistent and courageous - in short , if it operates differently from the way it operated last year .
Europe 's abstention in respect of Libya 's chairmanship , however diplomatically tactical that was meant to be , is an admission of weakness and creates a lack of clarity with regard to Europe 's position .
In order to exert maximum influence , coordination must take place with the United States on as many aspects as possible .
I understand that that does in fact happen .
It is very important to my group that the European Union makes efforts particularly in respect of resolutions on slavery , immunity from punishment , torture , brutal interpretations of Sharia , discrimination against women , freedom of religion , the situation of indigenous peoples and certainly the protection of human rights activists as well .
We place great importance on the resolutions on the 17 countries in which Iraq , Iran , Burma , Sudan , Saudi Arabia , China , Russia and Colombia are in particular named .
Selection is inevitable , but that certainly does not mean that all countries that have not been named will get off scot-free .
I would also like to draw particular attention to the renewal of the mandate of the special rapporteur for Iran , the strengthening of the position of the High Commissioner in Colombia and the approval of special rapporteurs in Chechnya .
The European Union must integrate the outcomes of Geneva into its policy and resume the political dialogue with the countries concerned .
As the human rights rapporteur for this Parliament for this year I say : let the European Union do everything it can to restore the authority of this UN Human Rights Commission .
We cannot do without it , there is no alternative .
A meeting is only successful , however , if it is feared by the violators and applauded by the victims .
Mr President , I am a critical person , and I am very sad to have become afflicted in this period with pessimism regarding the future of our world too .
Over and above our high-sounding declarations of principle , human rights are being violated in far too many countries : Chechnya , China , the African countries at war , Israel , the USA with the death penalty and so on and so forth .
The blame lies not just with those violating these rights but also with those who see what is happening but do not intervene and genuinely enforce international law .
In this sense , governments are often indifferent towards the work of UNHCR and their recommendations go unheeded .
Like many of you , I feel indignation when fundamental human rights - the right to life , freedom of thought and movement - are ridden roughshod over in countries professing to be democracies too , and , today , illiberal , death-dealing acts are being carried out in the name of the war against terrorism , although that is not to say that terrorism must not be combated , as in the case of the massacre in Mazar-I-Sharif .
I would like a measure to be taken in March which would make Israel , for example , which is a signatory State , respect , if not the UN resolutions requiring an end to military occupation , at least the Geneva Convention .
Collective punishments , the demolition of houses , schools , hospitals , factories and shops , the uprooting of trees , arbitrary arrests , torture , extrajudicial assassinations , vandalism and theft perpetrated by Israeli soldiers , which I personally witnessed in Ramallah , are tragic , daily occurrences in Palestine , like the attacks against civilians in Israel .
Three hundred and fifty Palestinian children and 80 Israeli children have been killed in the last two years , innocent victims of our failure to act .
We have the means to do so but we often use two different sets of checks and balances : it is our alliances , not our values , which carry most weight .
Europe is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law .
If we are not consistent , first and foremost in the context of European Union affairs , employing all the means available to us , including the suspension of the association agreements with countries which have blatantly violated human rights , how can we be credible as promoters of these rights within the United Nations ?
We need the provision of enough UNHCR financial and human resources to be able to act more effectively .
At the March conference , we must take tangible decisions such as sending a peace-keeping force to protect the civilian population in the occupied territories and refusing to allow Israel to obstruct or even fire on humanitarian missions .
The resolution on which we are going to vote outlines effective , valuable priorities and commitments - such as the operation of the International Criminal Court , human rights monitoring in Iran and the cooperation of the institutions with associations and NGOs from civil society - which will further education and respect in the field of human rights and democracy .
Mr President , I would like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission to a number of issues , a number of dossiers which have received wide coverage in the international press but which we appear to have overlooked somewhat in our political activities .
The first concerns an African country which is travailed by daily violations of the most fundamental human rights , Zimbabwe , where a Head of Government and his regime of violent , brutal racism towards the settlers , the farmers of European origin , have encouraged the perpetration of incidents which , along with the attacks on the democratic rights of the local African opposition to this regime , place this country wholly outside the realms of democracy .
I am dumbfounded by the debate in which our European authorities appear to be bogged down , as if there were any question of allowing the head of this bloodthirsty regime which is brutally riding roughshod over human rights to take part in the France-Africa Summit in Paris in February or the EU-Africa Summit due to take place in Lisbon in April .
I believe that the Council and the Commission must act resolutely , and I feel that a committee whose very raison d 'être is to safeguard human rights must not overlook repeated brutal incidents ?
( The President cut off the speaker )
Mr President , Lobsang Dhondup , a Tibetan , was executed three days ago , despite all the appeals made by world public opinion and the human rights organisations , and the approaches of ambassadors of EU Member States notwithstanding .
Nor did our debate in this House , and the resolution we adopted unanimously on 19 December 2002 , have any effect .
On 26 January 2003 , the People 's Court in Chengdu confirmed the death sentences that had been passed on Lobsang Dhondup and on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek .
They were accused of involvement in an attack using explosives and of sabotaging national unity .
Lengthy solitary confinement without contact with family or legal representatives is a manifest breach of the UN 's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners .
Their trial was neither fair nor in accordance with the rule of law .
A public hearing in open court - demanded by this Parliament among others - was refused on the flimsy grounds that state secrets were involved .
There was no free choice of legal representation , and public defence counsel were appointed by the court .
Lobsang Dhondup 's execution resulted in immediate protests by the EU Member States .
It will also be on the agenda of the human rights conversations between Germany and China .
Great Britain has reiterated the demand for the death penalty in China to be at last abolished , and the human rights dialogue between the EU and China must now at last concern itself with this serious case .
It is a disaster ; while China is trying to cut a credible figure on the world stage , the most basic conditions of the defence of human rights are being disregarded .
On behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and as President of this Parliament 's Intergroup on Tibet , I call upon the Council , the Commission and the Member States to intervene without delay and prevent the death sentence with which Tenzin Delek has been threatened from being carried out .
For decades , this lama has worked in the religious , cultural and social fields - with such manifest success that all hardliners see him as a threat .
This appalling event can leave us in no doubt that China 's violations of fundamental rights should be on the agenda of the Human Rights Convention in Geneva , and the European Union must take the lead in this .
Mr President , I welcomed the reference made by the Council representative in his speech to a calm , pragmatic position , and I am thinking , in particular , of the need for pragmatic action to call strongly , for example , for ratification of all the international conventions , which are the tools available for the States and the citizens to use to protect their human rights .
I would like to mention two , in particular , which are considered to be of particularly minor importance : the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination .
I then feel that we should continue to call strongly for a moratorium on the death penalty , not least in that it has become clear that , resisting any fatalistic tendencies or ideas of inevitable destiny , it is actually possible to persuade some US governors of the worthlessness of this barbaric practice : the fact that the governor of Illinois commuted 167 sentences shows that this is a battle that it is actually possible to win .
We call upon the European Union , first and foremost , to fight to ensure that there are no off-limits zones in the protection of human rights .
One such off-limits zone could be the fight against terrorism , which should be based firmly on respect for international humanitarian law .
Another free zone could be the fact that the Rome Treaty establishing the International Criminal Court continues to be treated by some countries , particularly the United States , as extremely insignificant .
The authority and effectiveness of this Treaty are in danger of being increasingly diminished by the attitude of the United States and its decision to adopt bilateral agreements with some countries .
Lastly , Mr President , I would like us to go to Geneva with a conviction which I hope we all share - that the first and highest form of defence of human rights is to avoid the destruction , ignominy and violence of war .
Mr President , one cannot but agree with the general principles expounded by the President-in-Office and the Commissioner , but what matters is how we apply them and I have three comments to make here .
First , we should not be mild-mannered psychotherapists in one country and unrelenting public prosecutors in another .
The criteria applied to Turkey should also apply to Iran and the criteria applied to Iran should also apply to Turkey .
And while we are on the subject of Turkey , it is about time that Leyla Zana , the woman awarded the Sakharov prize , saw the light of day .
And it would be an important achievement if that were to happen under the Greek Presidency .
Secondly , the United States .
In addition to what the Commissioner said , there is the question of the death penalty in the United States and we need to address this issue in the same way as we have addressed it in other countries .
And while we are on the subject of crossed swords between the European Union and the United States , I think it is perhaps about time we awarded a Sakharov prize to an American in 2003 , the outgoing governor of Illinois , who has pardoned 150 people on death row .
Thirdly , we must look at new rights being violated by measures against terrorism .
Mr President , although Member State governments have strongly criticised human rights abuses , regrettably they adopt a different approach in relation to larger countries like China and Pakistan , where there are huge trading and geopolitical interests at stake .
Our inconsistency is a form of political prostitution and undermines our moral authority in this field .
I welcome this joint resolution and , as mentioned in paragraph 16 , the EU Presidency should support further resolutions on a number of countries .
I would like to refer to three in particular .
With regard to China , the strike hard campaign continues to be extremely worrying , having dramatically increased the number of executions in China , often carried out in reliance on insufficient evidence in summary trials .
Severe restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of information persist .
Pro-democracy campaigners and political activists are often detained without charge and , in some cases , charged with inciting subversion .
It is essential that the Presidency make human rights a core part of all dialogue with China .
In the Middle East , I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism , especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists .
But I also condemn the state terrorism inflicted on the ordinary people of Palestine by Israel .
With regard to Iran , EU leaders had expressed the hope that engaging Iran in political dialogue would strengthen reformist elements and improve human rights .
Sadly , stoning seems to have been only stopped temporarily , for reasons of image .
Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly .
The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the EU .
It is imperative for the EU to show consistency in its stance on human rights on the global stage and particular at Geneva ; otherwise , no one will take us seriously .
Mr President , I should like to thank the speakers for their comments and observations .
I think they will be most useful to the Council , as will the references made to a number of countries and regions such as China , the Middle East and Zimbabwe , which not only reflect the Council 's position , they also reflect the action being taken by the Council and the Commission on a whole series of issues .
We are not sparing any effort to persuade everyone we can of the need to implement human rights .
Of course , what is important in the final analysis is for the pressure we exert to bring about results and not just remain political pressure .
Of course , I also agree with many of the other comments made but there is too little time to go into them , such as turning our attention to the problems in Africa .
Before discussing our position in various international fora , I should like to take this opportunity to comment on Mr van den Bos 's reference to the European Union 's abstention from last year 's vote .
I personally believe that the decision to abstain was not an expression of indifference .
That would not be in the nature of the European Union .
It was a considered decision which , it was hoped , would help the Commission on Human Rights operate smoothly under the political circumstances which arose last year .
I should also like to point out that of course we are interested in abolishing the death penalty , it is one of Europe 's crowning achievements .
This is clear from numerous discussions under way , including with the United States , where a number of agreements , especially as part of the fight against terrorism , cannot proceed unless there is a guarantee that the death penalty will not be applied to people extradited to the United States .
We take a keen interest in the question of the death penalty everywhere .
Mr President , I have noted that the issue of the death penalty has been raised by almost every speaker .
I agree that this needs to be pushed and is an issue which is , in fact , the same in every system , in every country .
As such , this issue deserves strong attention and more activity .
In response to Mr Fava 's remark - that by defending human rights we can avoid or prevent terrorism - I would also say that I only wish that were true .
It would be extremely good if this really were the case .
The world is more evil than that .
There is extremism and it is not possible to avoid the problem totally by having our own record straight or even having global decency really move forward .
This involves a number of fundamental problems , but having said this , I agree with the approach expressed in this formulation .
Certainly , we have to be extremely careful not to damage these ideals by fighting terrorism .
It is extremely important to maintain that balance .
On the vote in the Commission on Human Rights , and as a reaction to Mr Gahler 's remarks , it is not correct to state that the seven EU members of the Commission on Human Rights contributed to the election of the Libyan chair .
I would like to mention for the record that this is not what appears from the figures in that vote .
I have received six motions for resolutions
First of all , I wish to apologise , on behalf of Parliament , that the debates have been somewhat protracted .
We shall take account of the views that have been put forward and shall of course endeavour to avoid this kind of situation arising in future .
The next item is a continuation of the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , before commenting on the question of the exploitation of the wealth of the Congo , I should like to say that , by reason of my position , and I speak here for the presidency of the Council , I am obliged to respect the presence and the modus operandi of the European Parliament and I shall do just that .
I wonder if the European Parliament might find a way of establishing some sort of mutual respect or paying heed to the issues that arise from the functioning of the presidency , bearing in mind that the Greek Presidency will have to go back to Greece at some point within the not too distant future .
In all events , even if Parliament cannot find a way and cannot abide by a few rules , we shall abide by them , as befits our position .
Now on the question of the illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Congo , I have this to say : the international community has started to evince a keen interest in the illegal exploitation of natural resources in Africa over recent years , especially where they are used to fund long-term , catastrophic armed conflicts .
The chairman of the United Nations Security Council made a statement in June 2000 calling on the Secretary-General of the United Nations to set up a committee of experts to investigate the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo .
This committee was set up and started work in September 2000 and published its final report in October 2002 , in which it points out that high-ranking political , military and business figures in Uganda , Rwanda and Zimbabwe , as well as the Congo , are plundering the natural - mainly mineral - wealth of the Congo on a massive scale for personal gain or , in the case of Rwanda , for their country 's benefit .
At the same time , again according to the committee 's findings , Rwanda is funding its massive military budget mainly from resources taken from the Congo , occasionally using forced local labour .
The European Union has refrained from passing a resolution on this recent report by the committee of experts until the Security Council does so .
However , the European Union is in favour of introducing a ban and of imposing sanctions as and where necessary , preferably through the United Nations Security Council , rather than by individual countries or groups of countries .
As far as one particularly controversial product is concerned - so-called blood diamonds - both the international community and the European Union have taken specific action .
To be precise , thirty-seven countries and the European Parliament finalised a certification process for uncut diamonds at Interlaken in Switzerland in November 2002 , the so-called Kimberley process , precisely in a bid to fight the trade in illegally mined diamonds from conflict zones , especially in Africa .
The European Union also adopted Council resolution 2368 / 2002 on the application of the Kimberley certification process on 20 December , which is when it became operational .
I should like to finish by pointing out that there is a basic vicious circle here that needs to be broken .
Internal armed conflict opens the way for the illegal exploitation of the basic wealth of a country and in turn this wealth is exploited to perpetuate the internal armed conflict and the lack of development and stability mechanisms in the country .
Madam President , Parliament has long been concerned about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes Region in Africa in general .
Fortunately , armed conflict in the region has ended . It is now time to launch the process of reconstruction .
The future of the Democratic Republic of Congo and peace in that country depend on establishing democracy and sustainable development .
As regards establishing democracy , we trust the Pretoria Agreement will prove an effective measure and will be implemented in sensible stages . The Pretoria Agreement is truly an all-encompassing and inclusive agreement .
An all-embracing system of democracy can only be established if all associations and political groupings are included in the process .
This is especially important in the Great Lakes Region where a breakdown in social order was the root cause of the wars that laid waste to the region .
I welcome the meeting of the General Affairs Council held in Brussels yesterday and also the Commission 's decision to send a significant amount of humanitarian aid to the worst affected areas .
A number of major problems are still outstanding , however . They must be resolved to assure the future of the region .
Such problems can only be tackled through sound political institutions , once implementation of the agreement is under way . The major problem I have in mind is that of a system of justice .
Impunity is incompatible with democracy and there can be no peace without a system of justice .
In this connection , I would like to table an amendment to indent 4 tomorrow . I would like to replace the phrase referring to other places , when these acts have been committed with one referring to other places , including the acts committed .
The other element crucial to the future of the Democratic Republic of Congo is sustainable development .
The countries and the companies of the European Union have a key role to play in this process .
Companies can play their part by adopting an ethical code of conduct demonstrating commitment to sustainable development . Countries can be involved by establishing measures to limit the importation of goods of dubious origin .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists will relentlessly pursue its campaign demanding transparency and ethical standards from multinational companies in the developing world .
In this regard , we attach great importance to compliance with rules on child labour , the ILO labour standards , the sustainable exploitation of resources and the OECD 's guidelines on multinational companies .
The United Nations report adopts a clear stance on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
We hope Member States , the Commission and Parliament will all insist on implementation of the report 's recommendations .
Madam President , my group has not added its signatures to the joint resolution .
Of course we too agree that the illegal exploitation of the natural resources in Congo must be strongly condemned .
Of course we too agree that people and companies who enrich themselves from war must be stopped and punished .
We therefore welcome the fair analysis , the first in the hundred years since the plundering of Congo began .
It is , therefore , quite simply a shame that the report is so sloppy and that it contains so many unfounded accusations and inaccuracies .
This list of shame could have been an historic precedent , a warning to all leaders and business people who unscrupulously exploit the misery of millions for personal gain .
Instead it has become a weak , contentious document based on rumours and war propaganda .
Indeed , it has created an amalgam of illegal and illicit activities , and the persons and companies named in it were never heard , let alone given the opportunity to defend themselves .
This is why the report was weighed and found wanting by the Security Council this week .
The mandate of the experts was extended by six months .
The Security Council is absolutely right to urge that all the named countries institute their own investigation on the basis of which legal action can be taken .
We have submitted an amendment to this effect .
Even more fundamental , however , is the question as to how illegal exploitation can be avoided and counteracted in the future ; in other words , how a new stable and democratic order can be established in Congo that will ensure that the country 's resources are exploited in a controlled and sustainable manner in order to benefit the entire Congolese population .
The United Nations bears a colossal responsibility for this .
It is to be hoped that the Security Council will also search its conscience , review MONUC 's mandate , increase the number of troops and do everything necessary to speed up the application of the peace accords and the installation of new structures , so that in a few years ' time it will not be faced once more with the realisation that Congo is still being plundered .
Madam President , as a Belgian , this resolution appeals to me particularly because Congo used to be a Belgian colony .
Other countries too in old and new Europe are , however , guilty of plundering the natural resources of Africa .
It is simply not acceptable that this is still going on .
It is now no longer the old mother countries but , deservedly or undeservedly , European companies who are named in the UN report .
Europe must in any event take measures , because we have a collective historic responsibility .
I have just returned from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre , Brazil .
I also listened to the Africans there .
They are expecting a lot from Europe - for example , reparations of a kind .
A committee of enquiry has been set up in the Belgian Senate which will look into the illegal trade in raw materials in the region of the Great Lakes .
The main issue for Europe is that the Commission should propose a directive on the control of European companies that operate outside the European Union and that this directive should be quickly made law by every Member State .
On the other hand , a control mechanism for the exploitation of raw materials in Congo must be set up .
The United Nations has a more urgent assignment here than in Iraq .
Madam President , much of the United Nations report refers to the role of Zimbabwean interests and gives startling evidence of how the actions of Mugabe 's corrupt henchmen impact not just on their own people but also on neighbouring countries such as the Congo .
The Mugabe regime is a criminal racket and a major factor of instability , not just in southern Africa but , as the report makes clear , in central Africa as well .
The report describes the conflicts fought over minerals , farm produce , land and tax revenues by criminal groups linked to the Zimbabwean armed forces which have , for example , transferred at least five billion dollars ' worth of assets from the state mining company in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to companies under its control .
It is ridiculous even to think the Zimbabwean government could be asked to investigate its own activities .
The report not only provides evidence of the involvement of Mugabe in these activities , but names a numbers of other senior Zimbabweans , four of whom are subject to the EU 's restrictive measures but four of whom , to my astonishment , are not .
The political , economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe is worsening with serious implications for the security situation .
Two days ago , the United States government issued a travel warning urging United States citizens to consider departure from Zimbabwe .
Is it not therefore bewildering to the oppressed people of Zimbabwe that two European governments now seek to delay the renewal and dilute the force of the travel ban and other restrictive measures that the European Union has put in place against the Mugabe regime and which are due to expire on 18 February 2003 ?
Is it not deeply offensive that one European Union government has invited Mugabe to a summit conference in Paris ?
One reason why our measures have been ineffective so far is that they have not been rigorously enforced and their scope is too narrow .
This is not the time to be reducing pressure on the Mugabe regime ; instead , international action must be intensified .
May I ask the President of the Council and the Commission , in accordance with the clearly expressed wishes of this House over a year or more , to insist that sanctions be renewed unequivocally and that the EU measures be extended to include all of those involved in this racket in Zimbabwe and the Congo .
The European Union must be determined and consistent in its tough policy in relation to the Mugabe regime and see this matter through , for the benefit of all Zimbabweans .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is sad , but true , that if Iraq had nothing but dates , war against Baghdad would not even be on the agenda , even if the country were ruled over by a dictator .
If the Congo did not possess such an incredible wealth of natural resources , Africa would have far less in the way of problems .
The United Nations report has spelled out , albeit with perhaps insufficient clarity , the shameful forms of greed that give rise to the illegal exploitation of this wealth .
The global community must find ways and means of putting a stop to this exploitation .
There is a lamentable lack of responsibility , not only on the part of criminal elements , but also on the part of governments who would rather line their own pockets , and also in European business circles .
European enterprises must be made aware that the unscrupulous exploitation of Africa 's natural resources is not a petty offence , and so Europe 's policies must set a good example .
Illegal actions must be punished , and commercial undertakings must be made to comply with a code of conduct .
Madam President , Mr Rod asked if we found his choice of words a little too direct .
I certainly do not think the terminology was incorrect .
We need to work on a much broader basis on the issue of transparency and the principles of licensing .
I just came back from Angola and the discussion about creating more transparency on oil revenue for the government is an extremely important matter .
Even if there are not conflicts as such , progress in this area is important also for economic reasons .
In the event of conflict , it becomes totally brutal and perverse .
Mr Gahler related what we discussed here to the broader issue of Africa , mentioning also the coming summit in Lisbon .
One conclusion is that raising these problems with our friends in Africa collectively injects serious substance into the debates we can have at summits such as the one in Lisbon , which is one good reason why we have to ensure that the summit is a success .
We can use those types of meetings to push these issues .
Of course , this will be more effective if we have a clear and clean conscience ourselves .
This is not just an issue in the form of a narrow debate .
I definitely regard the link to using the OECD principles relating to this as a way of advancing transparency in relation to the issue .
For the Commission , this is of the utmost importance .
It is not enough to look at the public budget in a narrow sense when we talk about governance in our partner countries .
I would mention , by way of example , the good effort which is now being tried out in the funding of the oil pipeline in Chad .
This has now been incorporated into a framework of strong conditions governing transparency and the use of the revenue from that pipeline , in the context of the discussions between the World Bank , the IMF , ourselves and the government of Chad .
This is just to illustrate that there are many things that it is possible to do in this .
But definitely the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worse of them all .
In connection with this debate , I have received five motions for resolutions , submitted in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 )
The next item is a report ( A5-0002 / 2003 ) by Mr McCartin , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on action taken by the Commission on the observations accompanying the decision giving discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the 2000 financial year ( Commission ) [ COM ( 2002 ) 696 - C5-0610 / 2002 - 2002 / 2189 ( DEC ) ] .
Madam President , we granted a discharge to the Commission in April 2002 but we raised quite a number of questions in our motion for a resolution .
The Commission has responded with a hundred comments and answers and explanations in a 60 page document .
We now report in the follow-up , in our comment on the Commission 's response .
We underline once again that the Commission under the Treaties has an obligation to make available to Parliament all the necessary information .
It is on this basis that Parliament can examine and investigate all the transactions so that the discharge is not only a procedure , but rather a substantial assurance to the European public that Parliament supervises on their behalf and that a rigorous and thorough investigation is carried out .
In its work , Parliament relies heavily on the Court of Auditors ' annual report and its special report .
This forms an important basis for the issues that we raise and investigate .
I believe that , in recent years , the Commission has tried very hard to supply Parliament and the European public with all the information necessary to produce a valid and fair assessment on how the budget is spent .
In the on-going reform process , the Commission is moving in the direction of a system of control and accountability .
This has , I believe , been said by the President of the Court of Auditors in this House .
The Commission is moving towards a system of accountability which will compare with the highest standards of the Member States .
An important point made again in the follow-up to the report is that 80 % of the budget is actually administered by the governments of the Member States , while the Commission has final responsibility .
A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States .
The biggest problem still existing , as identified in our discharge motion for resolution , is the fact that , in the administration of the budget for the year 2000 , there was under-utilisation of resources in the order of 14 % .
Again , we have commented on the recurrence of the same problem in the 2001 budget .
This of course is a failure in the budgetary procedure but various comments have been made by different people and we have asked for a simplification of the regulations .
I believe , however , that what is necessary is a simplification of regional policy and the bringing about of economic and social cohesion .
The cohesion fund and the structural funds will have to be tailored to a more simplified policy if we are to pursue an efficient regional policy , particularly in the enlarged European Union .
This is not a policy that is in transition but rather a policy that we will have for the foreseeable future , particularly with the imminent enlargement , and we must simplify the whole policy so that these funds can be spent .
We also took note of the failure of the Commission to collect from the national governments money unduly paid and we note an outstanding amount of EUR 2.2 billion .
We are dealing with viable , solvent democracies and while we have to note that the age profile has become lower - the debt is not as old as it used to be - nevertheless , there is no good reason why EUR 2.2 billion should be outstanding .
The question has also been raised in our follow-up about the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor .
We have to underline once again that this is the policy of the Parliament ; the Committee on Budgetary Control has called for it , with the support of Parliament , on many occasions .
The national governments do not pursue the obligations to investigate frauds and abuses in relation to European money with the same efficiency that they apply to their own national budgets .
While that persists , we will persist with our call for the appointment of our own prosecutor , who can look after our own resources and be seen to do that .
Madam President , honourable Members , Mr McCartin , last November , I had the opportunity to present to you the Commission 's report on the measures we took following Parliament 's resolutions on discharge in respect of the 2000 Budget .
Mr McCartin has just mentioned that it ran to sixty pages , a fact that I had forgotten .
I could describe to you in detail the many action plans that the Commission has conceived , implemented or already brought to a conclusion in its spheres of activity , which are very wide-ranging .
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to Parliament 's resolution - which now exists in draft form - on this report , and I am glad that the present resolution acknowledges the Commission 's efforts to improve its financial management , and the steps it has already taken .
In general , the draft resolution encourages the Commission to press on with the efforts it has made to date .
At this point , I would like particularly to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for his good cooperation with the Commission .
I would also like to thank him for the speech he has just made , for the substantial amount of time and effort he has expended on the report and for the in-depth attention he has devoted to it .
Let me now briefly set out again the main steps that the Commission has taken with a view to improving financial management .
I would like to start by discussing the implementation of reforms .
The Commission has introduced a range of new instruments - what is termed ' activity-based management ' , APS , that is , annual political strategic planning , and the annual management plans .
In 2002 , the Directors-General , for the first time , submitted annual activity reports , which also specifically included financial management .
I am unable , at this juncture , to list all the measures , but , among the priorities for 2002 , I would like to give a special mention to the adoption of the new Financial Regulation and the drafting and adoption of the implementation provisions , along with the new financial regulations for the European Development Fund and also for the agencies .
The new Financial Regulation reinforces the Budget principles , something constantly urged by the Court of Auditors and , I believe , something essential in a Financial Regulation .
It gives the authorising officers an enhanced role and , above all , gives greater responsibility to the individual actors in financial activities , with the rules for procurement and the award of grants being tightened up and made uniform .
These are just some of the essential points .
Another priority for action in 2002 was the closure of the technical assistance offices , which we had the opportunity to discuss at the last meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
In order to make its internal financial management more efficient , the Commission has also , with the budgetary authority 's support , introduced a wide range of measures to modernise and improve public services , and , in particular , submitted to the Council proposals for a new version of the Staff Regulations .
In addition to that , decisions have been taken on administrative and disciplinary measures , and we have set up the Commission 's Investigation and Disciplinary Office - IDOC for short .
Another aspect of crucial importance to financial management is the Commission 's restructuring of its external service .
In order to better approximate programme planning to political priorities , we have drawn up strategy documents relating to countries and regions , and the management of the project cycle as a whole will from now on be the responsibility of a single body , EuropeAid .
The Commission has also stepped up the so-called deconcentration of powers in the administration of external aid , transferring them to its delegations in order to guarantee more speedy and , above all , sounder implementation of financial aid .
A second complex issue that I would like to deal with is that of the Budget surpluses , which Mr McCartin has also mentioned .
The discrepancy between the payment forecasts for 2001 and the payments actually made by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund resulted , in essence , from the programmes for the new planning period having completed their initial phases rather more slowly than had been expected .
An additional factor was that the payment forecasts submitted to the Commission by the Member States are often - if I may put it diplomatically - very optimistic .
In the course of the Budget year 2002 , the Commission had frequent occasion to remind the Member States of their obligations in this regard , in doing which it gave particular emphasis to the importance of estimates being as reliable as possible .
Let me , furthermore , follow Mr McCartin in making brief reference to the simplification of the rules of the Structural Funds .
One of last year 's priorities was to make the utmost use of the opportunities for simplification without going through the entire decision-making process , in other words to have recourse to whatever was administratively feasible .
With the general simplification of regulations and procedures in mind , the Commission has had recourse to a range of horizontal and sector-related initiatives , and it will now examine more closely , in the course of an ex ante evaluation of the effects of proposed legislation , which regulatory instruments are the best suited to the achievement of political objectives .
The Commission will also draw up a comprehensive report on the realisation of its objectives - broken down by policy area - and will forward it to the Council and to Parliament .
Recently - just before Christmas - the Commission also adopted a communication on improving the recovery of financial incentives provided in error from the European Budget .
A task force , set up by OLAF and the Agriculture Directorate-General , is now at work dealing with the issue , mentioned by Mr McCartin , of what one may term the claims backlogs in the area of agricultural policy .
I would like to underline the importance of the establishment of the internal audit service , which will monitor the control systems as well .
I would like to conclude by mentioning that , in the Commission 's view , our two institutions ' framework agreement on the forwarding of confidential information has proved its worth and has - in accordance with the requirement for transparency - made it possible to provide Parliament with confidential information when the latter has requested this .
Tomorrow , my fellow-Commissioner Neil Kinnock will be putting before the Commission his latest report on the state of play as regards reform .
This report had been called for by Parliament , and I think that it , too , will be a sound basis for discussion in the current discharge procedure .

Madam President , Commissioner , Mr McCartin 's follow-up report on the Commission 's management during the 2000 financial year , identifies clearly a number of issues which have caused debate and concern within the Committee on Budgetary Control . Under expenditure is one of the most important .
There was a budget surplus of 14 % in 2000 .
The figure for 2001 was 16 % . This situation should be prevented by improving the assessment of budgetary needs and the evaluation of running policies in order to optimise value for money for the European taxpayer .
The problem of under expenditure is most worrying in the case of Structural Funds , in view of their objectives and of the important needs they address . Most recipients find the Regulations too complicated .
In my view , applying the Regulations in a more flexible way could prove a solution to this difficulty . After all , the Structural Funds have a direct impact on citizens .
Commissioner Barnier has already made several statements along these lines .
As the rapporteur has requested , we should receive regular reports on progress in this area .
It is essential to improve management of the recovery of unduly paid funds in order to improve budgetary control .
The fight against fraud must be strengthened too . OLAF should report regularly on its actions , and should cooperate more closely with national courts of auditors and with the budgetary control authorities of Member States in order to assist the Commission in its work .
We will support the amendment tabled by Mr Blak aimed at improving access to documents .
This would facilitate the work of the House .
Madam President , Commissioner , the aim of this report is to assess the Commission 's implementation of the European Parliament 's recommendations .
This is a useful exercise that will add effectiveness and credibility to our work and on which I congratulate the Commission and also our rapporteur .
I should therefore like to review the main issues concerning the common agricultural policy that I raised in the discharge of the 2000 Budget , whilst reminding you , as required by Rule 9 ( 1 ) of our Rules of Procedure , of the fact that I am an olive-grower .
The high risk and even the practical impossibility of effectively monitoring the operation of the export refunds system was our overriding concern at the time .
We are pleased to note that , in his first annual report on the general activities of the European Union , the Director-General for agriculture has corroborated our viewpoint , in expressing his two main reservations about the Budget for this mechanism : firstly , that the Commission has reduced and simplified the system of refunds in the beef and veal sector and , secondly , that it is committed to gradually reducing the use of these mechanisms in line with negotiations at the World Trade Organisation .
We feel bound , nevertheless , to regret the maintenance of export refunds for sugar for European countries from which we import sugar freely , because this seems clearly to be asking for further instances of the same roundabout fraud already detected in the field of butter .
We note the Commission 's intention to invest in the research and development of means to detect the falsification of oil , but we are unhappy that we are still spending absurdly high sums and imposing extremely expensive schemes on national and regional administrations , and also on oil producers , to monitor the number of olive trees , without any concern to prevent fraud , in total contrast with the lack of means to prevent and combat the large-scale fraud against the Community Budget , consumers and farmers that the falsification of oil represents .
The same scenario or worse can be seen , incidentally , in the wine , dairy and most livestock product sectors .
I still find it unacceptable that farmers who exceed their milk quotas are heavily fined and yet nothing is done to penalise dishonest companies and criminal networks that produce dairy products without milk .
To conclude , I must state that the Commission 's refusal to name companies who are given export refunds and other subsidies on the pretext that this would contravene the provisions on the protection of the individual is totally unacceptable .
This is a concept of citizens ' rights that operates only in the interests of multinationals and large business concerns and which does not exist to protect consumers or even farmers , who are frequently the victims of a diabolical and destructive bureaucratic machine .

Madam President , Mr McCartin has drawn up an excellent report on matters that Parliament focused its attention on when it granted discharge for 2000 . I wish to express my sincerest thanks for that .
The way the EU budget is implemented is still unsatisfactory .
This is particularly true of the way the Structural Funds programmes are implemented , which does not meet the requirements of good administration any more than it does the expectations of the public .
The situation only got worse from 2000 to 2001 and the trend continued into 2002 .
In 2000 , EUR 6.5 billion in Structural Funds appropriations remained unspent , in 2001 the figure was 10.5 billion , and last year it was 8.1 billion .
The amount in unpaid commitments in respect of the Structural Funds has grown to EUR 66.7 billion , which is the equivalent of the budget for two years .
The situation is very alarming .
The Commission has been totally incapable of improving its administration : indeed , the situation is entirely beyond remedy .
The EU 's structural policy has to be thoroughly reviewed ; this programming period threatens to be a real catastrophe .
The review of staff regulations that began in 2000 and is still going on is one of the most important of the reforms .
In the opinion of my group it is important that the staff regulations should support the key objectives of administrative reform : improved efficiency , clarification of staff responsibilities with increased accountability , and the downward delegation of power .
It must be the obligation of every official to apply the whistle blowing procedure where necessary .
On the other hand , everyone must also be accountable for his or her actions in the sense that people must face the consequences of making groundless personal accusations .
The European Union must not become a place of espionage .
There must be a more natural and swifter way to claw back EU funds paid out for no good reason .
The present system is unwieldy and arbitrary , as is shown in the report by Jan Mulder , which we are to discuss next .
Unfortunately , the Member States and the Commission are often on opposite sides of the negotiating table , even though they should really be on the same side .
I think the practice initiated by Mr McCartin of providing yearly follow-up with regard to the reports on discharge is appropriate , because it brings a long-term quality to Parliament 's monitoring of the Commission .
Madam President , Commissioner , this report sends out an ambiguous signal .
The rapporteur is giving the European Commission a pat on the head instead of the urgent stimulus that is needed to drastically improve management of the EU budget .
This report makes the European Parliament dependent on the goodwill of the Commission instead of championing the interests of the many tax payers who want to see value for their money .
I was not happy to see that the Commission is stating that most of the irregularities and fraud involving EU money take place in the Member States themselves .
That may be so , but the Commission has the duty to manage the EU funds and is ultimately responsible for them .
Virtually all special reports from the European Court of Auditors contain the comment that European regulations are too complex and too vague , objectives are not clearly defined and control systems are deficient .
We must be able to approach the Commission on these issues .
Compare this with the board of directors of a multinational denying responsibility for the efficiency of business activities that take place away from their head office .
I have yet to encounter a shareholder who would accept that .
It is obvious that the way the budget is managed by the Commission leaves much to be desired .
The enormous structural budget surplus , a milk quota rule dating back to 1984 that is still not working properly , the uncertainty about the effectiveness of most of the structural measures , the deficient bookkeeping that is a source of problems including the claiming back of amounts from EU funds that have been paid out in error .
I could easily fill up this list with other examples that show that the European Commission still has a great deal to do before there is any chance of receiving a positive Statement of Assurance from the Court of Auditors .
Madam President , Commissioner , may I quote something ?
When the great surpluses in the 2000 Budget year came to light , the Budget Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , was quoted as saying , on 30 May 2001 : ' Such a large surplus is an exception .
It means that , in the 2001 Budget year , the Member States will be required to remit markedly fewer own resources to the European Union , 81 billion etcetera instead of 90.9 billion .
I regard this as thoroughly good news for the Member States . '
End of quote .
We know , Commissioner , that this was not an exceptional occurrence .
The problem with this Budget surplus - for that is what we call it - is that the surpluses get bigger the longer the period lasts , or so we have been able to establish so far .
So there is something intrinsically wrong with the system .
It is not good news for anybody if we are not in a position to establish the reality of Europe 's Budget .
I am not going to stand up in front of the taxpayers and say , ' I stand for a Budget totalling EUR 90 billion , provided that only EUR 80 billion is actually spent ! '
That is not good budgeting !
It is not you alone that I blame , Commissioner .
I know that you are doing all that you can .
We too , as the budgetary authority , have to do something , as do the Member States , but I tell you this : no Parliament with any self-respect , and committed to Budget reality can sit by and watch these things happening .
In future , we will have to adjust the amounts and figures actually spent against what was originally planned , or the other way around .
In the long term , that is just not on .
In the long term , our citizens will not stand for it .
That is the crucial point about this discharge procedure for the year 2000 .
As I have said , things got worse rather than better in 2001 .
This is something on which we have to work together .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is a report ( A5-0447 / 2002 ) by Mr Mulder , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the reform of the procedure of the clearance of accounts [ 2002 / 2149 ( INI ) ] .
- ( NL ) Madam President , when we look at the European agricultural policy , two things catch our eye .
Firstly , it takes up almost half the budget - that is a widely known fact .
Secondly we can state fairly generally that this policy is not held in particularly high esteem in Europe .
I think that something needs to be done about this .
Perhaps the proposals Mr Fischler made last week can improve things .
I think that we must also ensure that the agricultural accounts are above suspicion .
Now , agriculture is part of the European budget for which there is a special procedure for auditing the accounts - the clearance of accounts , as it is known .
Every year , between EUR 600 million and EUR 800 million is claimed back from this budget of approximately EUR 45 billion .
The big question is whether this is enough .
Since 1996 we have had a new procedure that more or less involves closing the accounts annually and taking long-term decisions on the conformity of these accounts , in other words about the question as to whether this budget has been properly executed .
In 1996 a conciliation body was set up to resolve any conflicts between the Commission and the Member States , and accreditation of the paying agencies responsible for execution and payments in the Member States was introduced .
That is being left to the Member States .
What experience have we had since 1996 ?
Firstly , following in the footsteps of the Court of Auditors , we can draw the general conclusion that there is a mixed system that is relatively satisfactory - but that is as far as it goes .
There is clearly room for improvement .
What improvements do we want to see ?
We would like the decisions on discharge to be more clearly based on one specific financial year .
At the moment these decisions still relate to different financial years , and that is ambiguous .
In 1996 we also expected that everything would take place a lot more quickly , but that has clearly not been the case .
With regard to the conciliation body , we had hoped that there would be fewer cases before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg , but that has also not been the case .
If a specific paying agency keeps making mistakes , the Commission should , in my opinion , have the opportunity to withhold payments for a couple of months until it is satisfied that the paying agency is functioning properly .
The Commission might say that this does not tally with the system of proportionality and that the penalty is much too great .
We are certainly not arguing for all payments of agricultural subsidies to a specific country to be suspended , however ; what we are saying is that if things continuously go wrong in a certain sector , the Commission must be able to stop paying the money into the Member State 's account until the situation improves .
The control of agricultural subsidies is particularly important in view of the enlargement of the European Union .
The system that will soon be used for making payments is the IACS system .
We can see from the reports from the Court of Auditors that this system is not yet operational in any of the current Member States .
We hope , as does the Commission , that it will be operational in a few months ' time .
We also note that Greece still does not meet the conditions despite having been a member for so many years .
It is therefore all the more urgent that the Commission propose a firm approach to this matter and thus also refuse to pay the money if these things are not put right .
We also think that it is a shortcoming that there is still no discharge arrangement for an increasingly more important part of the European budget , namely rural development , as there is for the 1 A part of the budget .
Now I would like to touch on another of this Parliament 's pet subjects : we would like to know from one year to the next which points can be said to have been improved .
We are familiar with the DAS methodology and could envisage getting indicators about the size of the percentage error in the dairy sector or the tobacco sector , for example . This is something that Parliament has been wanting for some time .
We would then be able to check from one year to the next how much improvement there has been .
This evening the Council is conspicuous by its absence , which is highly regrettable given the importance of this subject .
We would like to see the adoption of Parliament 's proposal of about a year ago , to the effect that the period of time allowed for corrections should be extended from 24 to 36 months .
In conclusion - again in the context of enlargement - we think that it is high time the Commission created ways of controlling agricultural subsidies better by paying them in advance so that we can avoid errors instead of having to correct them afterwards .
Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder on his excellent report and on the work he has carried out on the clearance of accounts .
I must also extend these congratulations to Mr McCartin .
We have , in fact , attempted to work , albeit holding different political points of view , in a direction that I believe is necessary to support a thoroughgoing reform of the common agricultural policy .
In any event , I think it would be a serious mistake to see the clearance of accounts merely as an activity whose success can be measured according to the profits made .
The need to recover funds from the Member States is primarily more an indication of failure than of success , because it demonstrates the poor functioning of the systems of farm subsidies .
This is frequently due to the enormous complexity of these systems and the disproportionate bureaucratic burden that they impose both on the administrations and on the farmers themselves .
Secondly , we must consider that the clearance of accounts in situations in which the Member State replaces food-producing or farming companies is an abusive form of State aid that distorts the rules of competition in a particularly unfair way , benefiting those who defraud the public purse and causing those who act honestly to suffer .
Thirdly , the forms , processes and criteria with which this clearance of accounts is undertaken do not always appear to be as balanced as they could be .
We note , for example , that with regard to the mega-scandal of butter falsified by the Neapolitan camorra and marketed by various European dairy companies , the Commission gave an answer only a few days ago , to the effect that , more than two years following OLAF 's submission of its allegations , nothing has yet been done , with legal confidentiality continuing to be invoked as the reason for doing nothing .
This is not acceptable .
Lastly , I should like to refer to the establishment of an incentive mechanism of 20 % for Member States to recover funds from the economic actors , which appears in principle to be a good idea .
I feel , however , that the way this is being carried out by the Commission is unacceptable : we are quite horrified to hear that the Commission cannot tell us how much it has spent on this incentive , it cannot tell us what Member State institutions were given these funds and whether the legal conditions necessary to recover them were properly checked .
This is a situation that we find totally unacceptable and we hope that the Commission will remedy it as soon as possible .
Madam President , Commissioner , we have before us Mr Mulder 's report on the reform of the procedure for the clearance of accounts .
This reform seeks to prevent the long delays in clearance decisions , which have been criticised frequently by the Court of Auditors .
The reform consists of two separate procedures .
The first is an annual audit on the revenue and the expenditure of a single financial year . The second is a series of multiannual compliance audits intended to verify the substance of transactions and compliance with Community legislation .
In addition , a conciliation procedure was introduced .
Despite the difficulties entailed by this procedure , it has been shown to increase the responsibility of Member States , although it has not been as effective as was anticipated .
The Conciliation Body has not been sufficiently effective either . It has however contributed to the overall improvement in the clearance of accounts .
This report highlights how the procedure for clearance of EAGGF accounts requires further improvement . It puts forward a series of suggestions to this end .
My group will therefore fully support the report .
Finally , I would like to congratulate Mr Mulder on his report .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my broad support for Mr Mulder 's own-initiative report on the reform of the clearance of accounts that has been approved by the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I am also of the opinion that it is still too early to deliver an opinion on the validity of the new system , because its complexity and the limited capacity of response of the Community 's administrative institutions make it impossible for a definitive assessment to be given .
It is noteworthy , however , that the European Parliament , political body par excellence , is concerned , on its own initiative and in line with the specific rules for studying proposals , with the way in which resources common to all of Europe are allocated and with the outcome of this allocation .
The reform we are now studying must be developed , to enable information facilitating multiannual comparisons to be made available to the monitoring bodies in good time .
This responsibility falls to the Commission , something that the rapporteur , Mr Jan Mulder , does well to point out , setting this in appropriate terms .
I also share the concern and the recommendations of the rapporteur when he examines the strengths and weaknesses of the accreditation mechanisms , the implementation of financial corrections , the control of expenditure allocated to rural development and the new problems that will inevitably arise with the functioning of the Union under enlargement to twenty- five countries .
We must also remember that the policy 's primary focus must always be the allocation of financial resources , especially when dealing with less highly-developed countries .
It is crucial that the management systems of the applicant countries are defined and integrated , promoting and developing both the delegation of powers to the Sapard agencies , and shortening the chain for implementing aid instruments .
We cannot overlook the fact that the CAP is currently a potential source of equality and absorbs 47 % of the Community budget , which requires the use of specific auditing and regulatory procedures .
Lastly , I believe that , regardless of the current quantitative results of the conciliation process , this process must continue to be used and extended , because it is precisely by implementing it that all the advantages and disadvantages of a political consideration and decision on the implementation of Community funds can be exploited and validated , reserving for the judicial system the exclusive right to act on the fraudulent use of funds made available to Member States .
Madam President , the report we have before us is certainly excellent . As I already said within the Committee on Budgetary Control , I can but support it .
Crafted with meticulous attention to detail , it consists of two clearly differentiated parts and has two distinct aims . Firstly , there is a critical and rigorous assessment of the reform .
Constructive criticism is applied to the deficiencies of the latter . These include the division of the clearance procedure , the structure and activities of the Conciliation Body and the financial corrections applied .
The shortcomings are detailed in a constructive manner however , and solutions are proposed .
Secondly , the rapporteur expresses rational and legitimate concern about the immediate impact of enlargement , which is nearly upon us .
This concern relates especially to the consolidation of the Integrated Administration and Control System in all Member States .
Everything should also be in place for this system to be implemented in the candidate countries as soon as enlargement takes place .
The lessons learnt about the SAPARD programme are also cause for concern .
In my view , the critical assessment and concern detailed in this report constitute a timely warning . We should heed it .
I therefore welcome the report wholeheartedly .
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the flexibility he displayed during the proceedings in the Committee on Budgetary Control . His approach ensured that the report was adopted unopposed .
This represents a considerable achievement .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is a report ( A5-0004 / 2003 ) by Mrs Korhola on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending , with regard to public participation and access to justice , Council Directives 85 / 337 / EEC and 96 / 61 / EC [ PE-CONS 3676 / 2002 - C5-0598 / 2002 - 2000 / 0331 ( COD ) ] .
Madam President , the proposal now before us is the second of three directives that aim to bring legislation in the Member States in line with the Århus Convention .
Just as with the first directive on access to environmental information , the third reading has now taken into account the result of conciliation , which represents Parliament 's position very clearly , and which meets the minimum requirement in the Århus Convention fully and even goes beyond it .
The Council adopted many elements from Parliament 's first reading in its common position , in the same way that Parliament was able to adopt many elements from the common position .
We thus set out to achieve conciliation with considerably fewer problems than there were with regard to the first pillar .
On the other hand , just these few issues caused huge problems , owing to differences in approach .
The Commission proposal and the Council 's common position are rooted in the ' quick fix ' principle , while Parliament had hoped for a broader , horizontal approach .
Obviously , however , it is not Parliament 's aim to defend its position to the letter , but instead ensure that there are no grey areas left in EU legislation where public participation would be justified but impossible owing to some blunder on the part of a legislator .
During conciliation we were able to find a two-stage solution to the problem .
On the one hand , the requirements concerning public participation in line with the Århus Convention are to be included in new Community legislation from the outset .
On the other hand , existing legislation and the field covered by the directive are to be reviewed on the basis of the experience gained during the first six years of its application .
During conciliation the Member States undertook to promote practical opportunities for public participation .
Authorities will be encouraged , for example , to inform the public about decisions taken , and the reasons and considerations upon which they are based , and public participation processes .
The time limits for participation in decision-making at the various stages must be reasonable , so that the public can prepare and participate in decision-making effectively .
In addition , authorities will be encouraged to promote environmental education of the public , which will also undoubtedly be in the authorities ' own interests , in that the extent to which people participate effectively can only improve through education .
The matter of public participation in the updating of permits was of particular significance .
The parties involved in the conciliation process wanted to find the right balance in this matter .
On the one hand , the public could genuinely participate when it is vitally important to check the operating permits of installations and factories , such as when there is a danger of an increase in the amount of environmental harm being done .
On the other hand , an authority could check permits without any public participation when implementing acts and regulations where it is genuinely not a matter of discretion .
I think we have succeeded here : the public can participate when decisions on the environment are actually being made , but the importance of a precious instrument for participation is not being inflated by asking the public to participate in routine decision-making .
What was for Parliament an important victory in principle , albeit small in scope I suppose , was when during conciliation a process for exclusions relating to national defence projects was adopted .
In accordance with the Århus Convention , projects relating to national defence may be excluded from the scope of the directive only on the basis of case-by-case decisions by the Member States ' authorities .
After decisions are taken following public participation the public must naturally be able to evaluate them .
In conciliation we arrived at a solution that is satisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned .
The public right of access to information about the reasons for granting or refusing a permit is to be endorsed and the authorities required to provide the public with practical information , if required , about access to administrative and judicial review procedures .
It should be mentioned in particular that , in order to ensure the result of the conciliation procedure does have an effect , the Commission has undertaken , in a statement to be annexed to the directive , to submit in the first quarter of 2003 a proposal for a directive concerning the implementation of the Århus Convention as regards access to justice in environmental matters .
We can therefore be confident that the ratification process of the Århus Convention on the whole will make headway in the Community without undue delay .
I would like to thank the Commission , the Council and especially Denmark , the country that held the presidency , now transferred to Greece , for their excellent levels of cooperation during conciliation and in the unofficial discussions that preceded it .
I heartily recommend that Parliament endorse the results of the conciliation procedure in tomorrow 's vote .
.
( SV ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am naturally very pleased that this directive , which the Commission proposed around two years ago , is now going to be adopted .
It supplements the Directive on environmental information .
With it , the EU is taking a step closer to the implementation of the Århus Convention .
The principles of the Århus Convention are very important , because the environment does not have its own vote , so to speak .
Decision-making on environmental matters must , therefore , be open and transparent if we are to afford the environment sufficient protection .
The scope of this directive covers fundamental requirements for public participation in decision-making on the environment .
This directive establishes a necessary common framework that also covers matters with a cross-border dimension . The details are left in the hands of the Member States , however .
This is important , because public participation must be at the heart of all levels of administration , and the forms it takes must be adapted to decision-making at the various levels .
The directive covers , on the one hand , important plans and programmes to be drawn up in accordance with our environmental legislation , and , on the other hand , decisions on activities that can have a significant impact on the environment .
These activities are covered by the Directive on environmental impact assessment and the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control .
These two directives are now being supplemented with provisions on public participation and access to justice in accordance with the Århus Convention .
By ' public participation ' the directive means that the public must be informed about the activities in question and its own right to participate .
The section of the public affected is to have the right to comment on a matter at an early stage .
Lastly , public bodies are to take due account of the outcome of public participation when making decisions and make their decisions known .
The directive also contains provisions on reviewing the legality of decisions that fall within the scope of the provisions .
I should of course like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Korhola , for her intensive work on the directive , and express my gratitude to her and to the members of Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee for the efforts they have made towards reaching this agreement , which has made it possible for us to adopt this important act tonight .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , one of the complaints most frequently made by the citizens concerns their limited role in representative democracy .
It is precisely in the area of the environment that people 's dissatisfaction has been most deeply felt .
We are all aware of cases in which , when confronted with certain projects or installations , the citizens feel compelled to express their right to be indignant in the streets or in the courts .
This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds .
It was therefore very important that , in the wake of the Aarhus Convention , the Commission has legislated on public participation and public access to information .
I therefore congratulate the Commissioner for the Environment .
Greater public participation will not only give greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions but also enhance the quality of these decisions .
This proposal for a directive on public participation in drawing up certain environmental plans and programmes is a good example of how the citizens ' participation in politics can be made more democratic .
I also congratulate our rapporteur on the work she has done in Parliament and also in the Conciliation Committee .
I should like to highlight three main results of this Conciliation .
Firstly , the fact that NGOs should participate fully in the debate on access to information in this process ; secondly , the fact that all Community legislation has to explicitly define conditions for public participation ; and thirdly the mandatory participation of the public in cases considered to be significant .
Lastly , I welcome the announcement made by the Commissioner that we will have legislation on citizens ' access to justice before the end of 2003 .
Madam President , Commissioner , the results of conciliation overall are good and worthy of our support .
The aim of the directive is to harmonise Community legislation with the Århus Convention .
It has already been said here that the directive will fully entitle the public to participate in the decision-making process right from the start , especially as regards planning and the implementation of programmes , the environmental impact evaluation process , the prevention of pollution , and the reduction in pollutants in general .
It will also allow the decision-makers to take the views and concerns of the public into account when making decisions .
This will obviously and quite properly increase the transparency of the decision-making process and help to increase public interest in , and knowledge about , environmental issues .
The requirements concerning public participation in line with the Århus Convention are to be included in future in relevant Community legislation from the outset .
It is also important that authorities should also inform the public about the reasons for their decisions to a much greater extent .
It is important in general too that on many points it is required that the information given is supplied in language that is clear and that the authorities help the public to understand the information that is available .
It is also good that public participation is to increase in the most important areas of all , that the public right of access to information about the reasons for granting or refusing a permit is being endorsed , and , once again , that authorities will be required to provide correct , clear and explicit information .
On this basis I believe we can expect the public 's inclination to have an influence on environmental issues to grow .
Madam President , I have to say that we welcome with interest , almost with some enthusiasm , the decisions taken recently which have now been included in these documents on public participation - one might almost say , playing on words , at least as far as Italian is concerned , ' private participation ' , for the word ' public ' usually refers to public structures or institutions whereas , here , it is intended to denote the participation of the citizens , of associations - in this process : a process which is not new today but was already present in previous acts of the European Union and in the context of which an evaluation had been set in motion , within certain constraints , of transparency , of objectivity and of the citizens interest in environmental issues being dealt with in a certain way .
We are now faced with something more , something different , and that is positive .
Indeed , what is happening through this process ?
We hope that the impetus to act - starting before the moment of decision-making - will come via those who are closest to the region , to the town , to the environment , and that it will then be taken up , transformed and handed back down in the form of guidelines , requirements and , if necessary , constraints , regulated through these rules by those with the authority to do so .
Basically , we must give the citizens the ability to act in a sector which does , indeed , concern them , which concerns even those who do not want to be involved , for the consequences of environmental damage affect the citizens first and foremost .
I must point out , in conclusion , that it will not , however , be at all easy to harmonise the different national laws with European requirements and directives .
The debate is closed .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mrs Wallström and the Commission , and also Mrs Korhola , for their constructive cooperation , because it was I who led Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee on this subject .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
The next item is a report ( A5-0003 / 2003 ) by Mrs Hautala on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Directive 98 / 70 / EC [ PE-CONS 3677 / 2002 - C5-0608 / 2002 - 2001 / 0107 ( COD ) ] .
Madam President , I will now present here the final appraisal of the directive on fuel quality , which we originally adopted in this House in 1998 .
At the time , as a result of a fairly heated debate and decision-making process , the European Parliament managed to push through the world 's most stringent quality requirements for fuel in road vehicles .
We quarrelled particularly with the oil industry about whether there was a need to lower sulphur levels in petrol and diesel fuel .
We actually had to put forward an enormous number of arguments to get the reform through that would reduce the sulphur content of diesel and petrol to a considerably lower level than it was then .
This turned out to be a very strategic and wise move .
Lowering the sulphur content of fuels will perhaps have proved even more important when we try to reduce air pollution .
The essence of this reform , which we in Parliament are today getting prepared for the home straight , is now that by 2009 only petrol and diesel fuel which is , in practice , virtually sulphur-free will be permitted to be sold in the European Union .
This will be very important in that we will really be able to purify car exhaust emissions to a greater extent than before .
The reason why this reform is more important now than the previous one , however , is that car manufacturers are continually developing engines which are cleaner and which produce fewer emissions .
These new engines , like direct injection engines , for example , will inevitably need these sulphur-free fuels .
We should be satisfied with the end result .
We succeeded in getting the Commission and the Council to agree that sulphur-free fuels would be on the market by 2009 , bringing forward the time frame by two years .
I would say , if predictions can be made here , that this situation will come about earlier than this anyway because many Member States have realised that this process can be speeded up substantially by granting very small tax concessions for cleaner fuels .
I might perhaps say that Sweden and Finland were the countries where this was realised earlier on and clean fuels were brought onto the market very swiftly .
In 2005 this directive will be reviewed . It is to be decided then whether there can in fact be sulphur-free diesel fuel by 2009 .
As rapporteur , I am only sorry that with this general solution we have not decided now that sulphur-free diesel fuels will be on the market in 2009 .
I think this interim evaluation in 2005 only complicates matters , but we did not succeed in getting this through in Parliament at second reading .
The suspicion has arisen that the production of sulphur-free diesel fuel would mean increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions .
I , however , believe that it would have been quite possible to introduce this reform now as any disadvantages of sulphur-free fuel production are offset by the fact that new cars are coming onto the market at a faster rate than ever and carbon dioxide emissions are becoming fewer as a result .
The re-evaluation in 2005 will also involve discussion on how sulphur-free or low-sulphur fuels for mobile machinery can be brought onto the market .
This was perhaps the most problematic issue of all in the conciliation discussions .
I myself would say I am fairly satisfied with the end result , which is that sulphur-free fuels will be introduced for tractors and other mobile machinery by 2009 .
I do not believe that farmers will have to pay a very great deal more for this as costs in general will ultimately fall .
Madam President , I wish to correct one thing in the documentation . It says that Parliament adopted one amendment at first reading .
This is not true .
I would like it recorded in the Minutes that Parliament adopted 36 amendments at first reading .
We shall check that and make sure that it is correct .
.
( SV ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is good that we have reached agreement on this directive : it forms an important part of our overall strategy of reducing air pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases .
Directive 98 / 70 / EC will enable us to ensure that the sale of leaded petrol is phased out .
Once the new directive has been adopted , it will pave the way for the introduction of zero-sulphur fuels , which will be available throughout the EU by 1 January 2005 at the latest .
Sulphur in fuel can impair the effectiveness of several existing and emerging technologies , such as three-way catalytic converters , oxidation catalysts , NOx Storage Traps and particulate traps .
That is why it is so important to phase in zero-sulphur fuels .
The phasing-in of zero-sulphur fuels will be complete by 1 January 2009 .
The manufacturers will thus be able to exploit the full potential of technologies in reducing the emission of pollutants , for example , nitrogen dioxide and particles constituting a serious threat to air quality and human health .
The adoption of this directive is really good news for health and the environment in Europe .
I would therefore thank the rapporteur , Mrs Hautala , and all the Members who have contributed to the adoption of this act .
Madam President , work on the amendment of this Directive began over a year ago .
We have finally reached an agreement and I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala on such a satisfactory outcome .
We encountered a number of difficulties during the first reading , but I believe we have now reached compromises acceptable to all .
As we heard , this amendment will mean that trade in diesel and petrol with a sulphur content exceeding 10mg / kg will be banned from 2005 .
The ban will be implemented gradually , with a total prohibition coming into effect from 2009 .
I think this is a good solution and a good compromise . Whatever your point of view however , although this measure will improve air quality , the production of the new fuels will undoubtedly cause an increase in emissions from refineries .
If the production and sale of new fuels do not go in tandem with renewal of the fleet of vehicles , there may be an overall increase in carbon dioxide emissions . Considerable costs would be incurred too , as it is much more expensive to produce these fuels .
It is therefore important for the Commission to assess the progress made . In 2005 it should also revise the date after which only low-sulphur diesel may be sold , especially where diesel agricultural tractors and road vehicles are concerned .
This is because diesel vehicles are replaced far less frequently than their petrol counterparts and their fuel consumption is relatively low . There is a risk that the improvements in air quality we all hope for may not be achieved .
Finally , Commissioner , as rapporteur for the biofuels Directive , I have to say that I think the Commission should authorise biofuel mixtures in excess of 5 % as a matter of urgency . It should propose new specifications on levels and new testing methods for biofuels and for fuels used by the inshore fleet .
Several makes of car are currently able to run on mixtures exceeding 5 % . There are however , no technical standards relating to vehicles of this type .
Countries have undertaken to reach specific targets .
Though the latter are not set in stone , they ought to be met . If countries are not able to use biofuel mixtures , it will be very difficult for them to do so .
Biofuels significantly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and are a useful way of improving air quality .
I would like to end by congratulating the rapporteur warmly once again , on behalf of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats . Congratulations are due also of course to the Commission and the Council .
I recommend voting in favour of this report .
Madam President , I am last but not least and I hope I shall not take three minutes .
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would welcome the results of the conciliation .
The decision to move towards low sulphur diesel across the Union should mean an end to the noisy , smelly , expensive and rather larger diesel engines and other off-road vehicles that disturb our air quality , the peace of our environment and communities .
We recognise the importance of taking into account the possible economic and social consequences of this change , in particular for the agricultural industry , and therefore welcome the sensible transition periods given and the encouragement of appropriate tax incentives .
We hope this will encourage bringing about change in a painless way .
We also support the need for an on-going review of the situation to ensure progress does not give rise to social or economic problems .
Therefore , on behalf of the Socialists , I would recommend the report to the House and thank the rapporteur for all the work she has done , as well as all the other people who have been involved in this long process .
We hope that we will now see some genuine results from our endeavours .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
( The sitting was closed at 11.12 p.m. )
World hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries
The next item is the Commission statement on world hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is nobody here who cannot see that the world is divided by a gulf separating those who have food from those who are hungry , those who can read and write from those who are illiterate , those who have access to healthcare from those who are not entitled to this .
There have been countless statistical reports . The most recent , the report by the World Food Programme , warns us that 38 million people are likely to die from lack of food , drinking water and medicines in the coming months .
Yet we must openly admit that the international community is not yet doing enough .
This is not the central item on our political agenda , as it should be . This is not the main criterion considered by the Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the G8 in their actions .
If we do not change our approach and speed up our action , if we do not succeed in regulating the globalisation processes with environmental and social sustainability , the historians of the future will judge our civilisation very harshly for this failure .
Let us focus on the diseases related to poverty , on malaria and tuberculosis . Let us consider AIDS , a scourge which has already claimed 25 million victims , let us remember the 14 000 people throughout the world who contract the HIV virus every day .
Prevention is essential but it is not everything .
It will be difficult to find excuses in the future for the fact that we do not succeed in treating 95 % of the people suffering from AIDS .
It will seem a real crime , considering that modern medicine can do a great deal to change AIDS from a terminal disease into a chronic condition and , in particular , to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to child .
Therefore , the European Union must put active pressure on the United States so that an agreement can , at last , be reached to exclude from intellectual property rights and patentability those drugs which , if used freely , will save the lives of millions of people .
This would go hand in hand with the intention to give a greater financial undertaking and with this draft regulation , which we hope will be adopted without delay at first reading .
Similarly , the decision to grant free access to the European market to products from less developed countries is important .
The European Union must now shoulder the responsibility of expressing the principles and positions we are discussing today in all international fora , starting with the World Trade Organisation .
Only thus , with a new form of governance on a world-wide scale , with greater participation and transparency , with practical decisions and measures , will we be able to combat hunger and poverty and win this challenge , the greatest challenge facing mankind .
Mr President , since the attention of the world is focused on the huge crisis of Iraq , it is the duty of Parliament and of all people of good will to shift considerable attention back onto the issue of combating hunger , as the European Parliament is striving to do today , not least in the light of the - I am sad to say , disappointing - results of the most recent summits , the most recent international talks .
Quite frankly , I would include among these the difficulty of converting a genuine impetus generated by many non-governmental organisations for rapid change and for a policy of assembling critical voices into a positive drive for change and reform , and , in this regard , I would refer to the recent statements of the President of the World Bank , James Wolfensohn , who both calls upon the institutions to do more and calls upon civil society to direct its critical gaze at the shortcomings of globalisation in a constructive way , setting substantial goals .
I would point out that it is right , including in the instrument before Parliament today too , for greater attention to be given to the dreadful situation in some parts of Africa , particularly Ethiopia , where some millions of people are in real danger of losing their lives .
It is clear to all - and the document we are about to adopt illustrates this well - that the situation can only be improved by correcting and modifying the structural errors and dreadful inadequacies of many governments which have continued to channel their money in the wrong direction , despite the fact that experience has shown , in the light of the facts , that it is necessary to change their approach in order to eliminate the root causes of poverty , the root causes of hunger and malnutrition and the lack of information whose consequences are an appalling health crisis and the denial of education and training to tens or hundreds of millions of people .
Moreover , it is clear to all that , in many cases , barriers to trade are another key factor which needs to be eliminated .
That would bring more freedom and , therefore , greater competition and more opportunities in addition to urgently-needed humanitarian measures .
This is what the European Parliament is striving for , and I believe we must all support it today .
Mr President , the world 's food situation is indeed tragic and is growing increasingly serious .
Millions of human beings live in extreme poverty and every hour of the day many die of hunger .
It is therefore crucial that rapid and far-reaching measures are adopted in order to put an end to this situation , which must surely weigh on humanity 's conscience .
It is therefore crucial that we adopt structural measures that are capable of preventing conflicts arising . It is equally crucial to follow up these fundamental measures with emergency measures to save lives now .
The emergency humanitarian aid that has been provided to date has proved to be inadequate , where both food and medical supplies are concerned .
We must , for example , provide a more substantial response to campaigns for high-risk areas , such as the awareness-raising campaign ' Hunger in Africa ' , launched by the World Food Programme .
We must also support timely initiatives such as those launched very recently by the new president of Brazil , Lula da Silva , both the initiative intended to eliminate hunger in his country , with the programme ' Zero Hunger ' and the other initiative presented in Davos , which is of a universal nature and calls for an international fund to be created to combat poverty and hunger in the countries of the developing world .
It is equally crucial however , as I mentioned previously , that fundamental measures are adopted , breaking first of all with a model that has proven to be inadequate and unfair , which places the least developed countries in an inferior position and treats them shabbily - particularly by claiming that everything can be resolved through trade - which perpetuates an unfair system of trade that attaches sole priority to economic growth and ignores the importance of a fair distribution of the wealth that is created .
We need a new world economic order , in particular one that contains profound changes in the bodies that are today crucial and which have guidelines that are out of kilter , such as the WTO , the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
A definitive solution must be found to the problem of debt and it is particularly necessary to ensure stable prices that compensate for the traditional forms of production in the least developed countries , mainly in the primary sector .
Priority must also be given to food sovereignty and food safety , in particular by guaranteeing that natural and human resources are harnessed and that people have access to land and water .
Mr President , this resolution contains a long list of excellent observations and proposals .
There is almost no aspect of the problem that it does not discuss .
That being said , we must , however , state that our arrangements so far have been quite inadequate .
We also state in this resolution that the gap between developed and developing countries became wider during the 1990s .
I think it important to emphasise three shortcomings of the resolution .
First of all , no mention is made of efforts to reduce the birth rate in the developing countries , given that poor countries are quite obviously in no position to create economic growth that can keep pace with the very rapid increase in the number of inhabitants of these countries .
Secondly , the resolution contains no discussion of the internal states of affairs that prevent people in the developing countries from living in freedom .
We recoil from removing those dictators who destroy people 's living conditions and the structures of their countries .
We want to have clean hands , and we believe that everything can be achieved through diplomacy , but we have to observe - as the resolution does too - that a great many of the countries whose populations suffer hardships quite simply do not have the freedom that is necessary for people to be able to change their situation . During the Iraq debate yesterday , we again saw very clearly that we do not want to make a point of removing these dictators by means other than words and diplomacy .
Only the United States is prepared to remove the oppressors by force .
Thirdly , our resolution indicates the need to reduce tariff barriers , but we forget to say that we lack credibility because our agricultural policy entails our dumping products on the poor countries ' markets , so destroying their own agriculture 's potential .
Our civilisation lacks , as it were , the basis for appearing ' worthy of imitation ' , because we cannot implement in our own countries the economic and political changes that are a basic condition for changing the trade situation and for our being at all able to improve the disastrous situation the world is in .
It is disgraceful that we are in no position to take more far-reaching decisions in this area .
I hope that everyone who votes in favour of this otherwise excellent decision today will be consistent and vote against the EU budgets that authorise the agricultural subsidies so damaging to the developing countries .
Developing countries that are in crisis are a good reason to call for more attention to be paid to the food shortage and its relationship with trade .
The resolution deals with problems that lie at the root of the crisis of which the food shortage is the persistent result .
The global economic recession is certainly taking its toll .
Economic decline hits poor countries hardest .
This concept is extremely relevant to the relationship between hunger and trade , although it is not mentioned in the joint resolution .
This omission soon results in poor countries being shown up as being insufficiently willing to liberalise or as having domestic structures that are too weak to cope with healthy economic development .
In addition to this cause of acute food shortages , I would like to mention another external factor : the debt problem .
Was debt cancellation not agreed in the context of the ' jubilee year ' 2000 ?
No more than half of the debt cancellations promised in 2000 have been realised to date .
This is directly linked to trade , as exports are often used to pay off foreign debts .
As long as a country is not free of this burden of debt , therefore , there will be constraints on the impetus that trade can offer for development in the country itself .
Thirdly , there is the risk of going over the top in the quest for liberalisation .
The resolution asks for developing countries to be given the leeway to make their sectors sufficiently strong before tackling international competition , and rightly so .
Prescribing one-sided protection measures is going too far , however .
This request for a sensible method and degree of liberalisation shows the sense in controlling the WTO process , a point that the resolution is right to touch on .
It would be better if this control was carried out in a national context rather than by international institutions .
The minister is , after all , responsible and approachable .
The European Commission may be an important player in Europe , but this does not change the principle : the WTO members determine the course of trade liberalisation .
Responsibility therefore lies primarily on that level ; it is also most clear-cut there and forms part of national policy with which the citizen can identify .
Conversely , this clarity is much less evident in international bodies with a large number of players and interests , such as a parliamentary assembly .
Fourthly , there are of course also factors that fall under the sphere of influence of developing countries themselves , such as good management and a strong economic structure .
A greater diversity of export products forms part of this .
The ACS Agreement has not yet resulted in this diversification in the exports of the least developed countries .
I would like to find out what the European Commission 's strategy is with regard to actual diversification and what efforts it is making to achieve this .
I am pleased that the Commissioner has arrived , as I would like to address this question to him .
Another point of ongoing concern is HIV / AIDS and the disastrous effects this has on the body , social relationships and the economic structure .
In this regard I would specifically like to ask to what extent the European Commission uses the highly preventative effect created by marital fidelity .
Incidentally , is the Commission willing to allow the scope for this in its policy on the basis of the highly successful results achieved in various African countries where this forms part of the information strategy ?
Finally , I would like to say that the resolution is to a certain extent bogged down in highlighting problems and does not mention any strong approaches to their resolution .
Because of the balanced approach to the issues in the problem , the resolution nevertheless gets my support .
The Commissioner has , at last , arrived , having survived the traffic jams .
I think the best thing is to let him listen to the rest of the debate and then give him the floor at the end to comment on the speeches he is able to hear now in the House .
Mr President , I am very happy to hear what Commissioner Nielson has to say , although I feel that we should have been talking to Commissioner Lamy today .
In a question I submitted to the Commission , endorsed by several of my fellow Members - whom I would like to thank - and which has led to today 's debate , I focused on the problem , which we have addressed in the past and are continuing to address in part , of the link between trade protectionism and world hunger and poverty .
You see , I believe that opening up the markets is , in political terms , more costly than granting aid .
In today 's debate , too many plans are being addressed , in my opinion ; it would be better to concentrate on this issue and press the Commission in this regard .
Opening up the markets means challenging the market positions of extremely strong lobbies , particularly the agricultural lobby in Europe and the United States , the textile lobby in Europe and the United States , and so on .
This type of policy is much more difficult , I repeat , than policies to grant aid , something which probably no-one - and I mean taxpayers - realises ; but it is by opening up the markets , much more than by granting aid , that we can give hundreds of millions of people real , lasting opportunities to escape from hunger and poverty and lay the structural foundations , including legal foundations , for economic growth , and civil growth too , in a spirit of freedom and democracy .


In this regard , the European Union - and this is why I am happy to listen to the Commissioner - is not doing enough , it has to be said ; it is going through the motions with the United States , but it is not doing enough : it did not do enough in Doha and it is not doing enough in the proposal on what are known as the modalities for the negotiating round concerning trade in agricultural products , which will follow Doha , maintaining excessively high protection levels and still including tariffs which will be reduced too far in the future .
This resolution is a compromise resolution , and it is showing the consequences of this : suffice it to say that the operative part contains 27 items .
That is to say it sets out the sum total of human knowledge on world hunger , AIDS , poverty and so on .
It retains some important points , in particular the Commission 's request to step up the implementation of the ' Everything But Arms ' initiative by the end of 2003 .
We have been striving , commendably , to liberalise our markets in all products , except arms , for the world 's 48 poorest countries , but we have said that for three basic products - bananas , rice and sugar - we will delay abolishing duties until 2009 .
If abolishing duties has a purpose - and it does - in the fight against poverty , then please let us do it now .
Mr President , the European Commission 's Everything But Arms initiative was and is an important breakthrough that enables the poorest countries to gain access to the European market without quantitative or tariff barriers .
Unfortunately this proposal was seriously toned down for rice and sugar at the time and was postponed following pressure by the European sugar industry and sugar-producing countries .
It is still important to realise that a country like Mozambique , which was completely dependent on food from elsewhere as a result of an endless civil war , is now able to provide her own food thanks to good internal distribution .
This has to do with the construction of water systems , good environmental management and the participation of local farmers .
With external help , the local systems were repaired after the floods .
In short , a success story .
The link with European agricultural protectionism is nevertheless very distressing in this case as well .
Under normal circumstances , Mozambique would earn as much from her sugar production on the world market as she now receives in international aid .
The situation is not normal , however , as consumer prices are artificially high in Europe , and are therefore ruining the world market .
This naturally requires a restructuring of our industry , including a social plan .
Our refusal to break through our protectionism structurally undermines poor countries ' own food supplies .
It is complete lunacy if the final stage in this vicious circle of hunger consists of dumping our surpluses on the markets we have already undermined through low world market prices .
We must continue to buy from the regions themselves as an absolute priority , even if the price is slightly higher .
In short , our proposals to turn Doha into a development round require more than the current Commission proposals .
The Commission has proposed cutting export subsidies by 45 % , but in Doha we were talking about abolition .
Forty-five per cent is only a start , and things must go a lot faster .
A one-third cut in tariffs is not enough either , and the Commission 's proposal to get tariffs on agricultural imports from developing countries down to zero must go further than just half of these imports .
This is of great importance when it comes to bridging the gap between the developed and the developing world .
It goes without saying that good governance , a good regional agricultural policy that does not throw everything into exports but concentrates first on local self-sufficiency coupled with regional trade , are likewise indispensable .
The help of the EU is very important in this regard .
Europe now gives with the one hand and takes away with the other .
Protectionism .
It is high time Europe started making a difference and really started cooperating with these countries .
Mr President , the statistics in relation to world hunger are indeed staggering .
By the time it takes to discuss this topic , almost one thousand people will have died of hunger somewhere in the world - the majority of them in Africa .
At the present time , there are about 800 million people in the world who do not have enough food and this includes 300 million children .
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of all of this is that the situation is not improving .
On the contrary , over the past decade , the gap between rich and poor , between the ' haves ' and the ' have nots ' , between the well fed and the hungry has grown even wider .
We , who are fortunate enough to be born into a part of the world where there are no food shortages , drought or famine , have a moral responsibility to work towards a more just world .
I do not refer simply to food aid .
I accept that the EU is the world 's largest donor of development aid .
We need to look at the root causes of poverty and hunger so these can be tackled and thereby eliminated in the long-term .
In terms of creating a fair trading system , the EU has made a significant contribution with its ' everything but arms ' initiative .
We have committed ourselves to fully eliminating the customs duties applied to the export of the world 's 48 poorest countries .
I would certainly hope those parts of the rich world that still maintain such barriers will be strongly urged by the Commission to adopt a policy such as we have done here within the European Union .
Sadly , there are many parts of the world today that are not self-sufficient , and we who have developed the techniques must share our technologies and our experiences with developing countries .
There are many excellent examples of the positive and successful work of the NGOs for example and other voluntary agencies in this challenging area and , in my view , this work must be fully supported into the future .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the statistics are now arriving thick and fast regarding what is , to say the least , a tragic situation .
Apart from the figures , though , I think that we should be shocked by the trend revealed by these statistics : this population which potentially has a death sentence hanging over it , despite the efforts of mankind , continues to grow .
According to the statistics , it has more than doubled in the last 30 years , and this is what should really concern us .
Furthermore , in addition to these people , to those who are in danger of dying from starvation and malnutrition , that is it seems , more than 30 million in Africa and 800 million in Latin - central and south - America , there are the millions of AIDS victims who each day truly represent a historic blot on the conscience of global society , which is unable to provide the necessary amount of resources during aid interventions and which is unable , above all , to make pharmaceutical multinationals forego patent fees and royalties , at least for emergency products .
This endemic situation of poverty , hunger and disease is accentuated by the acute economic and social crises which have trapped these countries in a downward spiral from which there is no escape .
The undertaking by governments and private parties to making these countries self-sufficient no longer suffices , and is barely coping with circumstances , with the daily emergency .
The economies therefore contract under the burden of public and international debts .
In order to tackle this emergency , as we know , the European Union has opened up its markets - in addition to expressing its solidarity - and has granted direct aid , but it is not enough : the efforts of many governments to limit or cancel debts incurred in the past by these countries does not yet go far enough .
In this connection , I would like to point out a development which has been overlooked to a large degree : during the G8 Summit in Genoa in July 2001 , at the initiative of the Italian Government , the summit of the most developed countries was preceded by a meeting with a large group of representatives from countries with public debt , starvation and poverty problems .
Well , this was not a merely symbolic or ritual gesture : that day , almost a third of the large , huge public debt of these countries was discharged .
Unfortunately , this result went unnoticed because of the rioting in the streets which attracted all the mass media 's attention .
Lastly , I would like to say a few words , in these appalling circumstances , on the valuable , irreplaceable role of the NGOs in all the Community and non-Community countries , which have always been on the front line in this war against starvation and death from malnutrition and AIDS .
The Commission really must substantially boost programmes devoted to them .
It must be said that , by themselves , these volunteers are achieving measures which are of a much higher quality and is much more convincing than those of all the western governments , and , above all , that they manage to put much more enthusiasm into this work , providing resources and solidarity , firm in the belief , Mr President , that no-one can feel free and happy if the others around them are not free and happy too .
Mr President , others have spoken about rich and poor countries , about the prosperity we have in Europe and the quite contrasting conditions in lesser-developed countries .
Mr Bautista Ojeda was speaking about that just a moment ago .
As Europe today revels in its economic success and prosperity , we need to consider at what expense it has been to other parts of the world , and the consequences for these counties .
Part of our success and prosperity today is the result of our policies of the last and the nineteenth century when imperialism went to other countries around the world , and we are now reaping the consequences .
We can do far more about this than we are actually doing at the moment .
The difficulties manifest themselves today in Europe in the pressure for people from less developed countries wanting to migrate to Europe , and in people fleeing from some of the countries that are so desperate not just because of their economic situation , but also their lack of democracy and violence , and seeking asylum in the west .
We can do more by helping those countries .
It is not just about huge amounts of development money ; the aid needs to be sustainable .
One thing that we can do to help those countries would be to look again at our common agricultural policy - looking to reform that .
At the moment , we are dumping subsidised goods on lesser-developed countries , which does not help their community , economy or farmers at all .
We protect our own agricultural community in Europe at the cost of other countries .
Whilst we are subsidising our agriculture , farmers and poorer people in countries all around the world are going under because they are unable to compete .
So we must look at the common agricultural policy .
We must work with the WTO to make sure that the standards and the conditions that they set do not contribute to poverty .
We can do more then we are doing at the moment .
Mr President , there is enough food in the world to feed everyone .
Naturally , it would help if crop yields were higher - but this is not , I repeat , not the essence of the hunger problem .
Free and in particular fair trade also helps , but that is not the essence either .
The essence is the distribution problem .
There is no hunger in countries with a parliamentary democracy , even if they are poor countries .
The political rulers know that they can be voted out .
With political dictatorships it is different .
Take Zimbabwe , for example .
The link between democracy and the absence of hunger was established by no less a person than Amartya Sen , the winner of the Nobel Prize for economics , from India .
The best solution is the promotion of democracy throughout the world .
This aspect is too often lacking in the European strategy .
Finally , if we were to do away with 5 % of the world 's military spending , we would have enough money to achieve the United Nations ' millennium goals .
Mr President , the gap between the rich , the poor and the poorest countries of all has been growing since the 1990s .
Removing the barriers to trade on products from developing countries on the part of the EU has not visibly improved the situation in third countries , although the EU is the largest export market for agricultural products from the developing countries .
One drawback of the European Union 's policy on developing countries has been the promotion in many places of autonomous production in those countries .
At the same time the export of heavily subsidised European agricultural products is harming or destroying local production .
Besides removing barriers to trade we also have to promote the spread of fair trade products in the Union .
The Commission has supported information campaigns for fair trade products , but at the same time has said their high prices will only fall if demand for them grows .
The EU should calculate the threshold price for fair trade products and raise the threshold prices for other products from developing countries .
A drop in fair trade threshold prices would help them to sell in the EU . That in turn would increase the volume of production in the developing countries .
Then production would move more in the direction of fair trade .
At the same time the Developing Countries Fund should be used to support in particular the farms that go over to operating under the fair trade sign .
Low-interest loans and development aid should be granted to develop these farms so as to organise training and education programmes for those who are left jobless , especially women .
We make donations and organise collections to prevent famine , but often forget that it is we who cause those famines with the import duties we impose .
Member States should also favour fair trade products in public procurement , with increasing demand resulting in lower costs and lower retail prices .
Global crop production cannot be increased by making the amount of land available for cultivation greater .
Scarcer water resources also have an impact .
Increased large-scale irrigation is no longer possible .
If food production cannot be increased we must change the basis for its distribution as well as our trading relations .
Apart from the uneven distribution of food , one of the reasons for famine that might be mentioned is often an unstable political situation .
At present the seriousness of the famine in Sub-Saharan Africa is specifically due to the fact that conventional humanitarian aid can no longer be used to prevent a catastrophe owing to political instability in the region .
The capacity of governments for confronting this crisis is totally non-existent .
Famine must be averted through social remedies as well as political and economic ones .
Often it is mainly women who suffer from famine .
Although women produce more than half the world 's food , according to an estimate by the UN 's Food and Agriculture Organisation , they nevertheless have the poorest prospects of owning land , being granted credit , studying and enjoying their social rights .
Parliament 's political groups have drafted a joint motion for a resolution on the statement by the Commission .
There is therefore very firm political backing for aid for the victims of famine and for financial support for the developing countries .
This should also be visible in the policies of the Commission and the Council .
My worst fear is that once again in issues relating to the developing countries there will be fewer deeds than words .
That must not be .
Behind theoretical speech there is a whole real world .
They are real people , not dummies .
They have a pain threshold .
This must not be forgotten .
Mr President , it is a sad day when you realise that , after fifty years of development aid , not one country has escaped the underdevelopment and poverty trap .
Many maintain that globalisation is the root cause of the state of the economy in the poorest countries .
The truth is that the North 's protectionist policy has helped to strangle crucial sectors in the South .
The contention that poor countries can achieve the same levels of income as rich countries without international trade , without incoming capital and investment , is quite simply nonsense .
If the poor countries make do with what is in their coffers or wait to develop their own technological capabilities , it will take them forever .
There is no such thing as true progress in a society where few become richer and many become poorer .
Hunger and abject poverty mainly affect women , making sexual inequality a huge barrier to development .
Over the last decade , the number of women living in absolute poverty has risen .
This is linked to reproductive health problems , because it is the poorest women that have the least access to health services and the most unwanted babies .
Nearly all of the half a million women who die from maternity-related causes live in the underdeveloped world and they die , not because they decided to become mothers , but because they are poor .
The probability of a woman dying in these circumstances is less than one in three thousand in the developed world , compared to one in nineteen in Africa .
These figures prove that the benefits of globalisation have still not reached that many people .
Continuing poverty is holding back this process through open trade .
The only solution is to overcome our two main enemies : the resistance of numerous political leaders in the North , who refuse to tear down barriers to the free movement of goods and people , and the resistance of numerous political leaders in the South , who refuse to give their people basic political , economic and human rights , without which there can be no development .
Mr President , I would like to express my thanks for the way you have handled my unfortunate problems getting here this morning .
I would start by saying that I find it both important and remarkable that across party lines everybody is basically in agreement in describing the problem and in pointing out what needs to be done .
This is important , even though one Member did remark that I might not be the right Commissioner to deal with this debate considering the kind of problems that are involved , and in particular the trade issues .
Well , we all have to face the reality that coherence starts at home .
In the Commission we have achieved a much better situation in terms of working across different sectoral views and lines , and concerning the balance between the global issues of development and trade today I am convinced that this Commission is working in a much more organised and predictable way , and reflecting more basic orientations , than previous Commissions .
I think Parliament itself should do more to ensure that the nice , correct analysis presented by all parties here is representative of the whole House .
The dark forces of agriculture in Europe are not only working in certain governments .
This game is also going on in this House .
If we talk about fisheries , farm policy , agricultural reform in Europe , the acceptance of whether or not ' everything but arms ' should be subject to the modifications concerning sugar , rice and bananas , all this would be lacking in impact if everybody thinks this is only a task for the Commission .
We all have a responsibility .
Much as I welcome everything I have heard , and I am sure what I did not hear was of the same genre , and appreciate your encouragement , it would be more in terms of Realpolitik to return that message to Parliament itself and ask for a partnership that delivers these attitudes also on those policy areas where we have difficulties .
As I say , I share the analysis .
A few remarks concerning figures : at the World Food Summit last spring , I offered the analysis that approximately 80 % of the people who are really starving in the world do so because of conflicts .
The problem of food insecurity or the inadequate mix or quality of the food is bigger than the number of people who are , in that sense , really starving .
It goes without saying that all these problems are directly linked to poverty .
I have just returned from a week in Zambia and Angola , and in Zambia in particular we were able to have a close look at the reality on the ground , visiting food distribution centres and support services for subsistence farmers and so on .
Everything that has been said here about the relation to trade policy , access to our markets and the need to diversify agricultural production and the economy in these countries is true , but it is also true that there is a sort of de-linkage from all this affecting the very poor subsistence farmers .
They are not anywhere near a monetarised economy and do not have anything interesting to offer in terms of cash crops .
They do not get services as such .
This is the hard-core category of poverty and it is their food insecurity that really creates the picture we are trying to do something about in the current crisis in the Horn of Africa .
This is a long-term structural effect showing that neglect , poverty and marginalisation are the real problems .
More trade , the big global discussion , does not immediately help these people .
It is another layer , so to speak .
Now what we are trying to do in the southern African food crisis makes a lot of sense compared to those simply dumping surplus maize , a sort of opportunistic marketing if you will , into those countries .
So far , and this is a figure we can be proud of , 99.1 % of what the European Commission has been providing in the southern African food crisis has been bought in the region .
This makes sense .
In fact , we are performing the role of a catalyst to develop a market in the region , to give the right signal to producers , those producers who participate in the monetarised formal economy , who produce for a market and not just for themselves and the neighbour , if he is even worse off .
But there is a de-linkage between those actually playing in a market as agricultural producers and those simply feeding themselves , if they can .
The main problem is the marginalised , very poor group who cannot survive if there is more than one year of bad rain because then they cannot prepare the next season .
In terms of money and resources , this is not very challenging or problematic .
The big problem is to move them into something that reaches somewhat outside their own non-monetarised subsistence economy .
The discussion on ' everything but arms ' should be continued in the manner we are doing today .
Of course , we are not at the end of these discussions in the Doha track and I would strongly urge Parliament to keep up the pressure and input that I have heard today .
A lot of work needs to be done before we can aspire to earning the headline of being a development round .
To Mr Souchet I would say that the food sovereignty notion makes a lot of sense but sufficiency is not the only way to do it .
Singapore , for instance , is not self-sufficient in food production , which shows that there are other possibilities , but for the category of countries we are talking about here I have to agree totally that this is a good way of defining the challenge at national level .
But to say that protectionism and the right to subsidise agricultural production is a good idea is something I would warn against .
It is more important to open up between neighbours , also in this area .
Any way of stimulating the emergence of market mechanisms regionally is a key to getting things rolling .
Mrs Kinnock 's remarks about the economic partnership agreement negotiations highlighted the need to make our ACP partners more aware of their responsibility in moving this agenda forward .
The phytosanitary constraints , and different elements such as capacity building on trade negotiation , are not really a problem in terms of money made available .
The real problem is to define adequate , good , specific fundable projects and ideas .
For phytosanitary standards in fisheries we also have ongoing large programmes .
We are pushing to have a central help-desk organised in the Commission to which all problems can be directly channelled so we can fight the battle for a decent reaction in the Commission .
We hope to see a flow of ideas from the reality out there which can materialise in fundable actions .
That is the architecture of how we would like to accelerate what we do here .
Mr Santini said that NGOs did more than all the western governments together .
I agree that NGOs are extremely important , especially in the area of humanitarian aid but also generally .
But please do not shield the public from the raw information that , when we add all the different budget lines together , the Commission is channelling about EUR 1 billion annually through NGOs .
They sometimes have great difficulty , and are extremely shy , in telling the public how they are funded .
When MSF received their well-deserved Nobel Peace Prize , I sent them a telegram of congratulations in which I also told them that , as the provider of about 50 % of their economic basis , I felt entitled to extend even warmer congratulations to them , and would also hope that our partnership could be reflected in the way in which MSF present themselves to the public .
Unfortunately , I never even received an answer .
That does not change our relationship but I urge Parliament to help me insist on some reality when it comes to visibility .
It is difficult for our own public to understand what the money is really used for when it is shielded in this way .
One remark for Mrs Schierhuber , who said that fraud in development aid is a problem .
It is reckless for me to say no , but most corruption and fraud has to do with fat contracts , with management or mismanagement of oil revenue , diamonds , illegal logging and other heavy stuff .
In the case of our development cooperation work , it is not that big a problem .
I admit that , technically , fundability is here to stay , as it provides more flexibility in the budget .
That being said , our general track record and ability to trace and document is quite good .
You remember when the Ivory Coast was playing around with money and the hammer fell .
They paid back and that is how the piano plays .
I should like to dispel the notion that development cooperation in itself is a problem , as this is not the case .
It is also why following and delivering on Monterrey is important .
We have reach the point as regards the quality and handling of development cooperation where it is meaningful , in fighting poverty to say that more of the same is right .
Finally , I should like to say to Mr Santini that if Italy were to move from the previous and current level of 0.15 % of GDP for development assistance to the 0.33 % in 2006 called for in the Monterrey decision , such a contribution on the part of Italy and other Member States below the current average of EU partners would make the most interesting and relevant response to the discussion here today .
Thank you , Commissioner .
To wind up the debate , I have received six motions for a resolution
The real global scandal of hunger in the world forces us to react .
In that sense , the European ' Everything but arms ' initiative is to be welcomed .
The example of the coffee crisis , however , demonstrates that this is not enough .
This raises the question of stabilising the prices of raw materials .
We must also think about how to guarantee that the profits from trade in these products do end up solely in the pockets of the multinationals who control the market , but that they are also redistributed to the farmers .
Tens of thousands of people , including those who were at Porto Alegre , have proclaimed their desire to see a world that is more fair .
The Brazilian President , by declaring that his priority is ' Zero Hunger ' , has generated an enormous feeling of hope .
The European Union must respond to this aspiration and to those hopes .
In order to do that , it must accept its obligation of solidarity , for example by abolishing debt and introducing a Tobin tax , but also by preserving the freedom of the developing countries to organise their public services in spite of the pressure of the negotiations carried out in the context of the GATS , and by preserving their freedom to choose whether or not to accept GMO seeds .
The next item is the debate on report ( A5-0394 / 2002 ) by Mr Wijkman , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation on aid for poverty diseases ( HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis ) in developing countries ( COM ( 2002 ) 109 - C5-0100 / 2002 - 2002 / 0051 ( COD ) ) .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Wijkman , who has worked tirelessly to secure adoption at first reading and has also exercised great skill in tackling the substance of this matter .
Our proposal for a regulation on poverty diseases was adopted last March .
The Commission places high priority on health questions and development , and has presented a programme of action to counter HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis .
I think we are agreed on the importance of improving health in developing countries .
As regards the regulation , we have had lengthy and constructive debates on issues including inter alia the TRIPs Agreement but it is the financial issues , which have proved most difficult .
I would just remind you that the reality of budget support linked to results in health matters , and indeed education , logically forms the missing link in these discussions .
As we move on and improve on indicators , I feel confident that we will build up a more robust consensus between Parliament and the Commission when it comes to demonstrating what we are in fact doing in these areas , even if the method of doing it cannot simply be described by referring to budget lines as such .
The situation is improving and I just wanted to reiterate this point in the ongoing discussion .
The Commission can accept all the amendments voted by the Development Committee , as they strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation without altering the main objectives .
There are also some up-dates made to references in the Commission 's original proposal which we are happy to accept .
These amendments reflect constructive collaboration between the Council and Parliament and the Commission .
The rapporteur has now submitted an amendment presenting a proposal for EUR 351 million for the years 2003 to 2006 .
I am of course sympathetic to the proposal to increase the funding but I must tell you that we have not been able to find the necessary resources within the Community budget .
If this point has to some extent been a casualty of any shortcoming in communication between the rapporteur and my services , then I regret that , but I must make it clear that a sum of that magnitude is not within the lines of the budget .
We , Parliament , the Council and the Commission , have agreed substantial increases for this budget line in 2003 compared to the 2002 budget line for HIV / AIDS .
During the December Plenary Session , an amendment was adopted which increased the 2003 budget allocation to EUR 80.35 million .
A financial declaration agreed by the three institutions specifies that EUR 42 million is to go to the global fund and the remaining EUR 38.35 million to the programme for action .
The Commission continues to see health issues as a priority and is determined wherever possible to find resources to improve health , whether through health sector programmes or budget support linked to improved health indicators .
We will also propose a further substantial contribution from the EDF for the global fund against HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria .
Ladies and gentlemen , I must point out to you that a further 26 minutes of this debate remain . Provided we keep to the timetable , there is time for all the groups to have the floor for the time requested .
I am sure you will understand that I need to be very strict over speaking time .
I would ask you all please to remain silent out of respect for the speaker , otherwise the debate will become much more complicated .
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and , as you said , speaking on behalf of the Budget Committee , we are largely supportive of this report .
However , there are one or two amendments that cause some difficulties .
As the rapporteur stated , Article 28 of the new financial regulation requires that any proposal submitted that has budgetary impact must be accompanied by a financial statement and an evaluation .
This report does not do so with respect to the new figure of EUR 351 million , so my committee will only be in a position to support this report if the rapporteur tables an oral amendment to this effect .
I hope that all the groups in this House will support this approach because objecting to the oral amendment will only lead to referral back and delay .
Moving on to this figure , we have to recognise the constraints in the financial perspective that we have at the moment .
Unless we use the flexibility instrument , it will be very difficult for us to meet the amounts stated .
So it will have an impact on other policy areas within heading 4 and my plea to all parties is that , when we move on to this stage , this should not be done at the expense of other policies affecting the poorest countries .
We do not want to give with one hand and take away with the other .
This is precisely what the Development Council states : any funding should be additional .
Personally speaking , I welcome whole-heartedly the contents of the Commission paper and the rapporteur 's proposals , and I applaud the fact that the EU has led the way in this area .
HIV , tuberculosis and malaria are the world 's greatest killers and are the most serious diseases affecting the world today .
Nearly six million people have died .
So much EU funding is used for intangible issues , and I hope we will support this report .
Mr President , I would like to begin by congratulating my colleague Anders Wijkman for an excellent report which took him seven months to complete , but he battled his way through it and I am very proud to be associated with him in this work in the Development Committee .
We have called this report ' Diseases on poor countries ' and we have focused on Africa , where 28 million people are HIV positive , and on the potential increase in these dreadful diseases in India and China , as well as TB and hepatitis B. But these are no longer diseases of poor countries because of our global inter-dependence and the fact that , for example in the United Kingdom alone , 115 000 settlers are now coming and living in our country and we are allowing 100 000 asylum seekers to come into our country .
HIV rates have increased by 100 % in the United Kingdom in the last year to 5 000 cases .
TB has increased by 200 % to 7 300 reported cases .
The London Borough of Brent now has a higher rate of TB than China and twice that of Brazil .
26 300 hepatitis B infections were reported in the last four years in London alone .
One person in 50 in east London has hepatitis B - the same level as in Nepal .
So why the reference to poor countries ?
No : this is a global epidemic where we are inter-dependent , and what we do to help the people in the developing countries to eradicate and stop these diseases is also going to have an enormous impact on how we and our children are going to live in Europe .
I think we need to establish the connection between development and what happens in our own countries , and I now want to ask the Labour Government to act on this before it is too late .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to compliment the rapporteur , Mr Wijkman , on his outstanding report .
Poverty-related diseases are a serious threat to the development of poor countries , and we have the important task of helping these countries fight these diseases .
The World Fund , for example , is a very useful tool for tackling the combating of disease on a global level , and at the moment it is being suggested that the EU contribute EUR 35 million to it .
There are calls to increase this amount .
Despite the useful work they do , I myself do not endorse this directly .
I think that it is very important to first take a look at what happens to the contribution .
We must have the guarantee that the money will be spent properly and efficiently .
Transparency plays a major role in this .
I therefore wholeheartedly endorse the rapporteur 's proposal to include the actions financed from the World Fund in the Commission 's annual report .
I myself also believe that the pharmaceutical industry has an important role to play .
Not only must they offer affordable prices , they must also be willing to share their know-how with partners in developing countries .
A win-win situation .
By producing products locally , they will be contributing directly to combating poverty , increasing knowledge and fighting disease more efficiently , as the products will already be with the potential customers .
So there will be fewer logistical problems , and the TRIPs do not have to be an obstacle to this , given the Doha Declaration .
Finally , in order to ensure that we can combat poverty effectively , I would also argue for more attention to be paid to informing the population .
It is extremely important that patients realise that once a course of treatment has begun it must be finished .
How often do you hear the complaint that a patient with malaria has contracted a resistant variant because he stopped his course of treatment too soon out of ignorance .
We must pay the necessary attention to this as well .
Information and education must be spearheads in our development policy , also in relation to combating poverty-related diseases .
The pharmaceutical industry can make a formidable contribution to this .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , my compliments to Mr Wijkman for his excellent report and its tangible contribution to the fight against poverty-related diseases , a report , moreover , adopted by the unanimous vote of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
This is further confirmation of the need to speed up the adoption , which seems to be possible at first reading already , of this proposal for a regulation so that it can be swiftly implemented , in line with the European Union 's responsibilities to developing countries .
This is certainly a substantial contribution - albeit not to a large enough degree - to the recently constituted Global Fund to Fight AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , a fund strongly called for by the Italian Prime Minister too during the G8 Summit in Genoa and - I would add - which was made available in record time compared with the time which these things usually take .
I am afraid , however , that the situation is still alarming and there is no time to lose : we still can and must do much more .
I will not tire of repeating , once again , that we need a coordinated approach between policies on development cooperation , research and health in the fight against these diseases , including through developing third countries ' health systems .
Everyone is aware of the facts , and among these I would highlight this one : each day , between 12 and 14 thousand people contract the AIDS virus throughout the world .
As Mr Deva rightly said , this is a disease which has now also arrived on our doorstep : just think of the thousands of children in Romania who have contracted this virus .
Therefore , although this is a global problem , it nevertheless affects developing countries in particular .
So while the budget represents the main obstacle to the adoption of this proposal for a regulation as amended , I would like briefly to consider a key element : the issue of drugs , their cost and access to treatment and medicines .
How can it be that , even now , only 10 % of both public and private research is dedicated to studying these diseases which are responsible for a good 90 % of disease in developing populations ?
I wonder what became of my request , which I submitted along with Mr Tajani more than two years ago , which called in this very forum for the urgent drafting of a common plan , in conjunction with the pharmaceutical manufacturers , that focused more on combating poverty diseases .
Given the scale and cross-border nature of the phenomenon - now on our doorstep - these poverty diseases call for a systematic response from the whole international community .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to confine my remarks to the subject of HIV / AIDS .
The World Population Report for 2002 , which has just appeared , contains some shocking figures .
On average , 14 000 men , women and children die of this scourge every day .
It is now the commonest cause of death in Sub-Saharan Africa .
To date , more than 60 million people worldwide have become infected and around 22 million of them have died .
Of the 40 million persons infected , 95 % live in developing countries and nearly three quarters of them in Africa .
Out of 580 000 children below the age of 15 who have died from AIDS , 500 000 - almost 90 % - lived in Africa .
I could continue with these statistics of misery indefinitely .
This catalogue of disasters is not only the sum of millions of human tragedies , however , but it is something that affects whole societies .
Life expectancy is falling , education is severely affected , agricultural output is declining , and the social and economic fabric is being eroded .
Plans for fighting HIV / AIDS must not be confined to the health aspects .
What is needed is an integral strategy with wide-ranging education and prevention campaigns .
Those who are already infected are entitled to the best possible treatment .
We carry some responsibility for that .
It is also up to us to provide the necessary knowledge , awareness and , of course , the necessary resources for prevention and treatment .
Because once a person is infected , that cannot be reversed .
In Sierra Leone I saw large posters on streets and squares with the blunt message : Aids kills ! malaria and tuberculosis can be cured , AIDS cannot .
AIDS can be avoided , however , and that is worth every effort .
Mr President , congratulations to the European Commission for making the programme for action against communicable diseases with its legal base in this area a priority .
Also to the rapporteur , Mr Wijkman , for fighting for sufficient resources to meet the challenge with our full support from the Socialist Group and , of course , to those governments in developing countries that have been prepared to challenge taboos and to patient groups in those and other countries who set an example of the sort of change of attitude required , both of whom prove that the battle against HIV / AIDS can be won .

But shame on the Commission for seeking to get the UN global funds on the cheap .
Shame on this Parliament for voting against increases in funds devoted to reproductive health , which is integral to the fight against the spread of HIV .
Shame on the pharmaceutical companies , who pretend to cut the cost of essential medicines when speaking to us in Europe but who fail to deliver in sub-Saharan Africa where the need is greatest .
Mr President , Commissioners do talk to each other and sometimes even write to each other .
I maintain that what we have achieved in this field of communicable diseases represents a good illustration of the Commission working across the different areas of responsibility .
This initiative would never have been launched and achieved its results without that work attitude .
As to the issue of further research into these diseases , this is also reflected in what my colleague Mr Busquin is doing , and the Sixth Framework Programme for European Research places greater emphasis on this research in order to accelerate it .
I agree that the pharmaceutical companies are not doing enough in this area from the point of view of global poverty .
It is interesting to note that the Melinda and Bill Gates Foundation has recently announced the availability of 200 million US dollars by way of a competition fund to prompt pharmaceutical companies to attract that money for accelerated research into malaria , TB and AIDS , but mainly malaria .
We will work with them and are of course already in contact with them , as this makes sense .
I would once again point out that when , as in this instance , Parliament is trying to raise additional funds for these activities , this is of course a welcome development .
As a Commissioner , I have to tell you that the Commission does not print money .
We have to work within the constraints of the budget and the perspective as defined by the budgetary authority as a whole .
So I repeat : we cannot accept the amendment regarding the EUR 351 million .
Thank you , Commissioner . On behalf of the House , I must apologise for the continual murmuring .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place today at 11 a.m.
Mr President , last year Parliament adopted a new version of our Rules of Procedure .
Rule 63a ( 2 ) of the amended text states : ' When the committee responsible amends the financial endowment of the act it is considering , it shall request the opinion of the committee responsible for budgetary issues ' .
While working on this report , the Committee on Budgets was consulted , but at an early stage before the budget amounts had been finally agreed upon .
We managed to reach agreement with the Council and with the Commission about an increase in the budget early in January .
Ideally , the Committee on Budgets should have been consulted again at a later stage and I am sorry this did not take place .
To remedy the situation so as to comply with the Rules of Procedure , I am proposing an oral amendment both to the legislative text and to the resolution .
I have of course discussed the amendment with the chair of the Committee on Budgets , Terry Wynn , and he agrees .
Thus , a new sentence should be added to the text in Article 10 and Amendment 42 , reading : ' The annual allocation is subject to agreement of the budget authority on the appropriate means of financing under the financial perspective or through the use of the instruments provided by the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 ' .
Mr President , consequently , we would add the following to the resolution : ' Considers that a financial envelope of EUR 351 million is compatible with the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspective only if the budget authority decides to reduce other policies or through recourse to the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 ' .
Mr President , I would just like to clarify , in the light of the remarks I made earlier this morning , that the Commission cannot agree to the EUR 351 million , given the realities of budget constraints as they are .
Mr Wijkman 's reference to an agreement with the Commission services early in January does not cover the reality concerning the Commission 's ability to accept this amendment .
Mr President , because I was looking behind me to see that everyone was voting , I failed to vote myself .
I vote against .
We will make a note of that .
Someone once said ' I am their leader , I must follow them ! '
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
Joint motion for a resolution
We will ensure that all language versions correspond .
Before the vote on paragraph 13 :
Mr President , in the light of current events , could Burma - or Myanmar - also be included on the list of countries cited as examples ?
Mr President , given that , despite worldwide protests , including protests from the European Parliament in December , a Tibetan was executed by order of a Chinese court four days ago and the same fate awaits a highly respected lama , I ask the House to agree to a motion going further than proposal No 8 from the Greens and Non-attached Members .
I propose adding the following to item 16 :
' condemns in the strongest terms the execution of the Tibetan Lobsang Dhondup on 26 January for alleged political crimes and calls for the immediate setting aside of the death sentence on the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek ' .
Thank you for drawing that to our attention .
Once again , we will ensure that all the language versions correspond .
( Parliament adopted the joint resolution )
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0052 / 2003 ) tabled by Charles Pasqua on behalf of the UEN Group , on the illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo
( Parliament rejected the motion for a resolution )
Motion for a resolution ( B5-0053 / 2003 ) tabled by John Corrie and Thierry Cornillet on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , to wind up the debate on the Council and Commission statements on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo
Before the vote on paragraph 4 :
Mr President , we wish to table an oral amendment to the fourth indent .
The wording of the Spanish text currently refers to when action is taken with a view to appropriating natural resources illegally . We wish this to be replaced with a text along the following lines : including action taken to appropriate such resources illegally .
Mr President , I would merely like to suggest that we have an oral amendment as a first indent , stating : ' having regard to the United Nations Security Council resolution 1457 to extend the mandate for a panel of experts investigating the legal exploitation of natural resources and other forms of wealth in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for another six months ' .
Mr President , what an honour !
I have had the pleasure of Your Excellency also hearing my explanations of vote .
In addition , I have discovered that , in today 's explanations of vote concerning Iraq , I will be heard by another great leader , who will be giving an oral explanation of vote .
I therefore welcome Mr Marco Pannella , who will be speaking about Iraq .
A great leader listening to Mr Fatuzzo : naturally , I am pleased about this .

With regard to the Mulder report , I would like to explain what ' liquidazione dei conti ' [ clearance of accounts ] means in Italian : ' liquidazione ' means ' dissipate , remove , liquidise ; ' conti ' is a title held by the nobility ; therefore , ' liquidare i conti ' means ' to get rid of the aristocrats ' .
So might this be a report against the monarchy ?
While I was daydreaming about this over a coffee this morning , I spilt my drink on my trousers .
Might this report - which , in reality , seeks to recover EUR 2.245 million defrauded from Europe - also just be a dream ?
. ( PT ) I welcome the outcome of the conciliation process , which I believe to be extremely satisfactory .
This proposal is of considerable importance , not only for the average citizen in the street but also for the Community 's environmental policy , because it provides for public participation in the drawing up of certain plans and programmes for the environment .
At the same time it attempts to harmonise Community legislation , thereby representing a significant step towards the European Union 's ratification of the Aarhus Convention .
The authorities are thereby instructed to inform the public on the decisions they have taken and of the reasons and considerations that have led them to take these decisions . The authorities are also to be informed on the processes of public participation and how to promote environmental awareness amongst the public , thereby providing incentives for the citizens actively to participate in solving environmental problems .
Therefore , free access , transparency and the dissemination of information about the environment will become a fundamental right of any citizen who is interested in the quality of the area in which he or she lives and works .
As a matter of fact , some recent disasters have clearly shown that the citizens have an increasing right to manage their risks , to speak out and to request and demand commitments to safeguard their interests in areas such as the environment and health .
I voted in favour of this Conciliation Delegation Report but with some misgivings .
The planning process is a key element of sustainable development as , because it covers land-use , it sets the physical framework for the way in which we live .
Unfortunately , this agreement does not fully follow the Aarhus Convention as it does not allow the public to be fully involved in the development of policy which frames planning decisions .
As the drafter of the opinion from the Petitions Committee on this proposal , we made the point that many petitions arise from the failure to consult adequately at the strategic stage .
This is another democratic deficit .
As an advert from British NGOs said when commenting on changes to English and Welsh planning law : ' Here 's the new nuclear power station .
What colour would you like the gates ? '
Neither do they allow for third parties to be involved in the full process .
This potentially removes expertise from the procedure and does not fulfil the sustainability objective of all of us having responsibility for our environment .
Overall , however , I welcome the inclusion of the granting of certain operating permits in these Directives and the great accountability required of decision-making bodies .
Hence my positive vote .
. ( PT ) I welcome the outcome of this conciliation process , which concludes the preparation of the second of three directives on environmental citizenship .
I wish to reaffirm the crucial importance of public control in the field of the environment , and I even feel , as I stated on 18 December last , on another report by the same Member , that access to information and the right to participate in environmental matters must today be considered to be a standard prerogative of citizenship .
I advocate a real citizen 's control of our environmental heritage .
It is worth pointing out that this directive seeks to integrate principles first put forward in the Convention adopted in Aarhus on 25 June 1998 ( during the Ministerial Conference ' Environment for Europe ' ) into the Community legal system .
This Convention enshrined access to environmental information and suggested greater public participation in decisions having an effect on the environment , thereby achieving more substantial effects from the rights laid down in the Stockholm Declaration ( 1972 ) and in Article 1 of the Rio Declaration ( 1992 ) .
Lastly , I have voted in favour of the report because I also wish to highlight that there will now be guarantees amongst other things , that the public will participate in authorising plans and programmes on waste management , pollution of the atmosphere and the protection of water against pollution by nitrates , and projects that have a significant impact on the environment , such as new airport terminals or certain military projects .
Still on the subject of this morning , Mr President , as I left the hotel in Chaussée de Vleurgat where I am staying here in Brussels - it was 7.30 in the morning - it was snowing .
The snow was falling in large flakes .
' What a beautiful sight , a fairytale landscape ! ' I said to myself .
Then I said : ' Mr Fatuzzo , you have to vote for Mrs Hautala 's report calling for quality petrol , which will give us a better environment in which to live .
Who knows then , ' I continued , ' whether with this report Mrs Hautala can give us , throughout Europe , a fairytale landscape in which to live , like that in her region , Finland . '
. ( PT ) I welcome the outcome achieved by the Conciliation Committee and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .
This directive is crucial to the fight against atmospheric pollution since , by acting on the standardisation of engines and on fuel quality , it makes a reduction in car emissions and consumption possible .
What is of particular importance is the link made , as a result of the European Parliament 's work , between this directive and the drawing up of a new national and Community fiscal policy for fuels .
The environmental costs must be borne by the economy and fiscal policy is one of the most effective instruments to achieve these aims .
.
( PT ) I broadly share the rapporteur 's concerns about the environment as well as her commitment to the common project . I have therefore voted in favour of the report .
I would , however , emphasise that the need to genuinely ensure , in Community as well as in national terms , geographical coverage that enables the effective marketing of fuels with a maximum sulphur content not exceeding 10mg / kg ( PPM ) .
Unless this situation is achieved , we will face many problems and issues that will inevitably be worse for the most remote economies .
I would lastly highlight the importance of tax incentives as a way of promoting fuels with lower sulphur content , which will certainly be an effective way of promoting their introduction .
. ( PT ) This report won my vote because it demonstrates the importance of speeding up the fight against HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in the context of reducing poverty in the developing countries .
These diseases kill more than five and a half million people every year , have destabilising effects on society , and compromise the work and the progress achieved over the last few years in social and economic development .
HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis require a global and coherent response , which will cost considerably more than the financial and human resources available to most developing countries .
Action in this field is in everyone 's interest and should not be seen simply as a development aid issue , but as contributing to improving health and reducing poverty in the developing countries .
We must , therefore , adopt a regulation on this matter , which aims to improve the overall provision of healthcare and measures of prevention , to reduce the costs of essential medicines and to step up research .
I voted for this excellent report but deeply regret the lack of final agreement on the budget allocation .
These diseases are major killers but they need not be .
Three things are needed to change the situation , as the report makes clear .
Firstly , clean water and sound nutrition .
The EU must ensure that its agricultural subsidies and trade practices do not undermine local food production .
Secondly , investment in the necessary infrastructure to deliver healthcare .
All Member States must change the balance of the IMF and World Bank to ensure that any financial restructuring does not threaten public funding for healthcare and education , which are closely linked .
Thirdly , drug treatment must be accessible and affordable : we must keep the pressure on the USA to stick to the agreements made on TRIPS , patent rights , production and differential pricing .
We need to increase our funding to ensure that people can survive these diseases .
The devastation caused by HIV / AIDS is well-known but TB is increasing and malaria remains endemic .
The necessary measure to combat these diseases would lead to an overall lifting of the quality of life for some of the world 's poorest people .
I support the rapporteur and his efforts to increase new funding .
In Europe we thought that tuberculosis no longer existed , and we were all completely unprepared for the development of the new disease AIDS or the increase in malaria heading in our direction on account of global warming .
We now know that these diseases are continuing to spread and are creating huge numbers of victims .
About 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV / AIDS , a billion new cases of TB are expected over the next 20 years and 40 % of people run the risk of contracting malaria .
In Sub-Saharan Africa the average life expectancy has dropped to 47 years , mainly because many young people are dying and children are having to grow up without parents .
Under these dramatic circumstances those people who generally want to extend freedom in the market and restrict government support are also agreeing to a significant European contribution to the World Fund to combat AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria .
Leaving it to the market has only resulted in there being no medicines available for those who need them most : the poor in the developing countries .
This proposal , which received unanimous support in the three committees concerned , recognises the failures of the market as a tool for combating these three widespread diseases , which are particularly prevalent in the developing countries .
This is a significant step forward .
.
( PT ) I welcome Mr Wijkman 's report and his proposal for a regulation .
Our commitment to combating easily communicable diseases , paying particular attention to poverty-related diseases , such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria and to improving levels of vaccination and healthcare by funding health programmes by the more developed countries , is crucial . Equally important is removing barriers , such as licences and patents , to access by developing countries to pharmaceutical products and international partnerships for developing new generations of products .
It should , once again , be pointed out that 70 % of people infected with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa .
.
( PT ) The three epidemics referred to in the report affect mainly the poorest populations . By way of example , 90 % of the 40 million people infected with the AIDS virus live in a developing country and 70 % of these in sub-Saharan Africa alone .
The re-emergence of cases in new forms - one billion people at risk of contracting the virus by 2020 - and the return of malaria in areas from which it had been eradicated , causing one million deaths per year , and with 40 % of the world at risk , destabilise entire societies and deal a harsh blow to the social and economic development of these countries .
A specific initiative in this field is therefore called for , delimiting the framework of Community action , in order to maximise the impact of action and to provide it with an overall budget of EUR 300 million for a period of four years , until 2006 .
We agree with the broad philosophy of the initiative , which is based on the medical and social need to combine prevention and care and which must also consider the increase in the budget for research and development , which is tragically low . This would strengthen infrastructures and health systems and link the field of reproductive health with the ongoing concern for maximum complementarity .
For all these reasons , I felt bound to vote for this report .
. ( PT ) I supported the main thrust of the report and of the amendments that were tabled , bearing in mind the urgent requirements of a challenge that absolutely everyone agrees on : to combat the diseases of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , which are linked to poverty in the developing countries .
I must , nevertheless , make some specific comments .
Firstly , with regard to the coordination of this action in the field of what is known as ' sexual and reproductive health ' , it must be emphasised how crucial it is that potential partnerships are established on the basis of a serious approach to health and with bodies that are not seeking to promote an ideological agenda .
At the same time , given the increasing seriousness of the scourge that is AIDS , we must keep an open mind , free from ideological preconceptions , about how the development of this disease is monitored , so as not to perpetuate mistakes and to detect , support and disseminate the most effective methodologies , even if they move away from the prevailing trend - as appears to be the case in Uganda .
Lastly , European cooperation both with United Nations agencies , funds and programmes and with NGOs working with these , does not mean that the implementation of Community funds should not be closely monitored , as should the rigour , seriousness and appropriateness of the actions that are funded . In fact the opposite is true .
This is necessary given the frequent allegations of maladministration , which are particularly shocking in an area in which human health and life are at stake .
This report is too important , Mr President , for me to decide how to vote without consulting the elderly people and pensioners who , through the Pensioners Party , by voting for me , have brought me to this important Parliament .
All of these pensioners said to me : ' Mr Fatuzzo , Mr Fatuzzo , Mr Fatuzzo , what a short memory many MEPs have , what a short memory many people have .
They have forgotten when , during the Second World War , the United States , Great Britain and other States saved Italians , Germans , Japanese and so on from many dictatorships and many dictators , who should be overcome before they cause harm and before they commit their many injustices , which we are all aware of . '
Mr President , we have just heard the latest act of that great opera ' Così fa Fatuzzo ' !
More seriously , I sit here as a representative of Scotland in the European Parliament , and we have had the opportunity to debate and vote on the substance of the issue of the Iraq emergency .
Our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have also done so .
Those at Westminster , shamefully , will be denied that opportunity even if a decision is made by Tony Blair to commit their constituents to war in Iraq .
My commitment to this Parliament 's resolution of this morning is unequivocal , above all as to its central point .
There can be no lawful armed invention in Iraq without express United Nations authority .
It is not enough for George W. Bush or Tony Blair to be satisfied that there has been a material breach of resolution 1441 .
Only if the Security Council so finds , and only if it resolves that action is to be taken , may action lawfully occur .
I am glad to see that the article by the Prime Minister in today 's Times effectively confirms that .
We look to the United Nations inspectors to oversee effective disarmament by Iraq or to establish its clear breach of the resolution .
They will need time for that .
If this is old Europe , then old Europe stands up for the rule of law and for the peaceful resolution of conflict wherever possible .
That is surely right .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , with this vote , the European Parliament has obtained three results of a similar kind : firstly , the pursuit of the Munich Policy , whereby peace is made with dictators and war is made with our democratic countries ; secondly , the attempt to divide Europe and America , the United States ; thirdly , the attempt to divide Europe - they are Ollenhauer , not Adenauer Germans , they are not Schuman but Debré and anti-European Gaullist French citizens .
These are the three characteristics .
We say : ' Freedom for Iraq !
A free I-raq ! '
European Parliament , the Americans are right : you represent an old Europe .
We will change you for the sake of freedom , democracy , the rule of law and thus peace , but not the communist , nationalist , clerical , fundamentalist or ' rest in peace ' kind !
Mr President , I voted with determination against the resolution on Iraq - which was adopted with the votes of a red-green coalition - on behalf of that young Europe of free peoples that certainly do not identify with the old , compromise politics and false , hypocritical pacifism where eyes are closed to the dreadful risk to European security posed by Saddam 's regime , which threatens us with a true clash of cultures .
Some amendments were rejected which sought to strengthen a text that portrays a cowardly and defeatist Europe , certainly not the Europe of the Battle of Lepanto , where the Pope was on the right side .
Under the circumstances , it is Europe 's moral and political duty to instead make a stand for the freedom of peoples and against the imminent threat - a threat posed by terrible weapons of destruction - of Islamic terrorism , which has secret links to Saddam 's regime .
Mr President , I want to say that I think today 's resolution on Iraq is very important because it reaffirms that we want to go down the United Nations route .
It is a pity that we could not get a big majority in this House to send a clear signal on behalf of the whole Parliament .
But I wanted to focus on the Middle East .
We did , in an amendment , stress the importance of the Middle East peace process to getting a solution across the whole of the Middle East and peace across the region .
It is regrettable again that we did that in an amendment because without a peace process , we will never see an end to the serious disruption in the Middle East .
We in this House should push the Israelis and the Palestinians to get back to the negotiating table and push the United States to take an active part in making sure there is a Palestinian state created and that there is a long-term solution in the Middle East .
We must not forget this while we are talking about the crisis in Iraq .
We must not lose sight of it because otherwise we will never have peace in the long-term .
- ( NL ) Oil is essential for countries that waste a lot of energy , especially America .
Iraq is rich in petroleum .
That is why there is much more interest in the problems in that country than in the injustices in other dictatorships .
Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator .
The Kurds in the north and the Shiites in the south would have a better life if he stopped interfering with them .
Nevertheless , these terrorised population groups never win the support of the outside world to enable then to separate from Iraq .
America in particular , which used to be on friendly terms with this dictator , wants to keep Iraq together at any price .
The USA is very keen to have a friendly regime that guarantees the continued supply of cheap oil .
We must not bomb these people , who are already disadvantaged by sanctions , further into Saddam 's hands .
More and more people in Europe and America are demonstrating under the slogan ' No blood for oil ' .
Unfortunately America cannot be restrained any longer , but Europe must make sure that it does not become an accessory .
The United Kingdom , Italy and Spain are threatening to go along with the creation of destruction and streams of refugees .
It is important for the European Parliament to speak out against a war that serves neither human rights nor the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , but only control of the oil wells .
. ( PT ) My position on the Iraqi conflict is clearly expressed in the speech I gave in yesterday 's plenary sitting .
An explanation of my vote is nevertheless needed , which I can only give through this statement .
Both the PPE-DE and the UEN felt it was necessary to table a set of proposals for amendments to the compromise resolution in order to balance the call for the conflict 's peaceful resolution , with which of course we agree , with maintaining adequate pressure by the international community , specifically the European Parliament , on the Iraqi regime , which we believe is a basic requirement for achieving this goal .
To be specific , we did not feel we could vote for a resolution that ignored Iraq 's ongoing and serious breaches of the UN resolutions , or which did not mention the fact that what is at stake in this argument is guaranteeing the preservation of international peace and security , or even linking the Iraqi regime to international terrorism and to the real danger that terrorist groups could be the recipients of arms of mass destruction produced in that country .
. ( PT ) I have ultimately voted against this report because I am disappointed at the vote on successive amendments .
My vote was determined by the fact that some improvements tabled by my group , all of which were balanced and in the interests of a free Europe were rejected , and amendments that clearly fall in line with the interests of Saddam Hussein 's regime were adopted .
It is worthy of the utmost condemnation that the majority has in this way betrayed the spirit of the very compromise that will guide the laborious drafting of the joint text .
This vote might well be celebrated in Baghdad and has , to this extent , at least one positive aspect : it highlights the deceptiveness of the argument of those who are rooted in an archaic left-wing ideology and have boundless rhetoric that appears to condemn but in fact simply plays into Saddam Hussein 's hands .
It is a paradox that this resolution , which consequently loses much of its virtue , should have been adopted by those who , even in yesterday 's debate , called Saddam Hussein , amongst other things , nothing less than a ' dictator and murderer ' - and yet do not follow this harsh and accurate verbal condemnation to its logical conclusion .
The final vote , in fact , contains a perverse paradox .
Many Members will have voted in favour because they believe that in doing so they are preserving world peace .
If it has any effect , however , particularly the effect of being celebrated in Baghdad and of weakening international political pressure on Saddam Hussein , this vote might have brought us closer to war .
Mr President , the Socialist Group supported the compromise resolution on North Korea .
We believe it is an important issue and I concur with my colleague , Mrs De Keyser , who spoke earlier .
We are concerned about human rights in North Korea , as we are about human rights in the European Union , but we should recognise the fact that when Goran Perrson , Mr Solana and Mr Patten visited North Korea back in May 200
