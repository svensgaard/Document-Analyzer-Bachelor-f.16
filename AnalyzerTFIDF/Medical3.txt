Abstract--Spayed GR mice treated with progesterone and estrone develop mammary
tumors within 3 weeks. The present paper demonstrates that uterine sarcomas develop
in a high percentage of those animals that survive 17 weeks of hormone treatment. The
growth of the tumors is hormone dependent, and estrogen as well as progesterone
receptors were demonstrated in the tumor tissue. Tumor cells were cultivated in
monolayer culture. After subcultivation the cells retained their hormone dependence as
tested by retransplantation in vivo. The uterine tumors in the GR mouse are suggested
as a supplementary model to the widely used mammary tumors to investigate sterozd
hormone action on tumor grou'/h.
INTRODUCTION
SPAYED GR mice treated with progresterone
(P) + estrone rE) develop microscopically
detectable mammary tumors within 3 weeks
[1]. After 14 weeks of treatment, 90% of the
animals bear palpable mammary tumors,
most of which are hormone dependent. These
tumors have been a valuable tool in the
investigation of differences between hormonedependent
and -independent tumors [2-9].
In the same strain of mice we have observed
that among those animals that survive 17
weeks of treatment some develop mesenchymal
tumors. Since these tumors may provide
a model for the study of hormonal
regulation of tumors we have investigated the
hormone dependence of these tumors as well
as their content of estrogen and progesterone
receptors. Furthermore, tumor cells were cultivated
in monolayer culture.
MA'IT_~ALS AND METHODS
Animals
The inbred GRS/AFib strain of mice that
carries the mammary tumor virus was used in
all experiments. The mice received standard
laboratory rat diet (Rostock) and were given
both food and water ad libitum. They were

kept under a constant light regimen of
12/12hr light/dark in makrolon II cages, 36
x 24 x 15 cm with 15 mice per cage or 26 x 20
x 14cm with 4-10 mice per cage.
Tumor induction
Eleven-week-old female mice were spayed.
Through an incision in each flank the ovary
was found and the distal end of the uterus
with the ovary was removed. The same day,
treatment with P+E (1) was initiated. P was
given as three pellets (10mg) s.c. per week
and E was administered in the drinking water
in a concentration of 0.5 #g/ml. In about 90 Â°//o
of the animals, mammary tumors arise within
14 weeks of treatment [2].
One hundred and fifty-six animals that had
survived 14 weeks of hormone treatment were
autopsied 14-25 weeks after the initiation of
hormone treatment. The occurrence of histologically
verified uterine tumors was
recorded.
Transplantation of tumors and tissue cultured cells
Uterine tumors were transplanted s.c. to
castrated male mice treated with P-FE, P, E,
or untreated. Each animal received 50-100#1
minced tumor tissue. Monolayer cultures were
treated with 0.25~/o trypsin to detach the cells.
The cell suspension was centrifuged at 150 g
for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in
fresh medium and approximately 2mg cell
protein per inoculation was given s.c. into
castrated male mice, some of which were
