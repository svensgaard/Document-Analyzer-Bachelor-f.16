Abstract--The urotoxic potency of various (mainly alkylating) drugs was studied in
an extensive series of experiments. It was found that damage to the kidneys and to the
efferent urinary tract (haemorrhagic cystitis) is a specifc side effect of compounds
possessing the oxazaphosphorine ring. This effect is due to the renal excretion of toxic
metabolites. The only carriers of urotoxicity are the renally eliminated fractions of the
4-hydroxy-oxazaphosphorines and acrolein which is formed spontaneously therefrom.
Other oxazaphosphorine metabolites and breakdown products such as the directly
alkylating phosphork acid diamides, 4-keto-derivatives and carboxyderivatives, have at
most only a very slight urotoxic potency. The relationships between the chemical
structure and the urotoxicity have been clarifed in the group of oxazaphosphorines.
Using a standardised test model (rat) the urotoxic side effects of cytostatics were studied
experimentally and were measured quantitatively. The urotoxic effects were found to be
dose- and concentration-dependent and also showed a marked dependence on the pH.
The manifestations of inflammation were more pronounced in an alkaline than in an
acidic milieu.
INTRODUCTION
DESPITE the advances achieved in recent decades
in the domain of cancer chemotherapy,
the selectivity and thus the therapeutic range
of many cytostatics are still unsatisfactory.
The achievable therapeutic results are limited
by toxic side effects. At the same time, it is
becoming increasingly difficult to synthesise
novel chemical compounds with higher carcinotoxic
efficacy. Great practical importance
therefore attaches pharmacologically to detoxification,
for reducing the general toxicity
and for preventing undesirable organotropic
side effects [ 1 ].
One of the researchers who has contributed
considerably to the pharmacological study of
detoxification [2] is Abraham Goldin. He
celebrates his 70th birthday this year and our
thoughts turn to him in friendship.

Forschung und Technologie, Bonn.

In principle, reduction in the toxicity of
active agents can be achieved in various ways:
Chemically, by alteration of the molecular
structure. This path has led from the toxic
nitrogen mustard to the development of the
much better tolerated cytostatics Endoxan g),
Ixoten '") and Holoxan ® [3-5].
PharmacologicaUy, by administration of an
"antidote". The pharmacologically detoxifying
interaction may take place locally, regionally
or systemically.
The occurrence of nephrotoxic and urotoxic
side effects, i.e. of damage to the kidneys and
to the efferent urinary system in the course of
medicinal tumour therapy, has been described
for many cytostatics (see survey [6]). In therapy
with oxazaphosphorine cytostatics, e.g.
with cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, the
urotoxicity--mainly in the form of sterile haemorrhagic
cystitis--is quite often a therapy -
limiting factor [6-9]. It is due to renal elimination
of activated aggressive metabolites,
596 Norbert Brock, Jb'rg Pohl and Jur O" Stekar
and its intensity depends on the concentration
of those metabolites in the urine [10].
Various prophylactic measures have been
recommended in the past [11], including raised
fluid intake, administration of diuretics,
alkalisation of the urine and, as an example of
local detoxification, instillation of mercaptocompounds
into the urinary bladder [12, 13].
The efficacy and practicability of these measures,
however, were by no means
satisfactory.
The systemic use of mercapto-compounds, for
example of N-acetyl-/-cysteine, has also remained
clinically unsuccessful so far because
these compounds become distributed throughout
the organism and reduce not only the
urotoxicity but also the anti-tumoral efficacy
of oxazaphosphorines [14, 15]. It was our aim
to develop a systemically administrable drug
which would not impair the chemotherapeutic
efficacy of oxazaphosphorines on the tumour
whilst definitively preventing the urotoxicity
of these cytostatics regionally in the kidneys
and the urinary tract ("regional detoxification"
).
The development of this "uroprotector" encompassed
three phases. In the first phase we
studied the mechanisms and parameters
governing the urotoxicity of compounds with
an alkylating action component, especially the
relationships between the chemical constitution
and the urotoxic potency of such compounds.
The second phase was devoted to
experimental testing of the uroprotective efficacy
of various active agents, particularly of
mercapto-compounds. The third phase was
concerned with the pharmacotherapeutic
characterisation of sodium 2-mercapto-ethane
sulfonate which emerged as a suitable uroprotective
compound.
The results of these three study phases are
reported in the three consecutive parts of this
communication, of which this is the first part.
In this first phase of these investigations we
had to clarify whether the clinically known
urotoxicity of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics is
an obligate side effect of alkylating compounds
as such or whether it is attributable to
a specific mechanism of action based on the
distinctive feature of the metabolism of
oxazaphosphorines.
Unlike the highly reactive compounds with
direct alkylating action, the oxazaphosphorine
cytostatics cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide
represent primarily inactive transport forms.
Their wide therapeutic range and high carcinotoxic
selectivity are based on enzymatic
activation (4-hydroxylation) in the liver.
These activation products are the primary
metabolites with a higher reactivity. These
primary metabolites are themselves transport
forms which later give rise to the actual
oncocidal active alkylating forms
(toxification).
By virtue of their high reactivity, directly
alkylating compounds expend their reactivity
rapidly in the organism and reach the kidneys
only in small amounts if at all, whereas
oxazaphosphorines and their metabolites are
eliminated renally.
To obtain precise information on the urotoxicity
of cytostatics it was necessary to develop
an experimental model which would
enable rapid and reliable evaluation of the
pathological changes occurring after systemic
and local administration of test substances
and, later, of prophylaxis against these
changes.

Procedure
It was confirmed in preliminary experiments
that induction of haemorrhagic cystitis in the
rat (and also in the dog) can be achieved
particularly easily and reliably by treatment
with oxazaphosphorines [10]. In the rat, a
single intravenous or oral administration of
cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide is sufficient to
induce inflammation of the urinary bladder
which is dose- and time-dependent. This
made it possible to develop an appropriate
test and to achieve qualitative and quantitative
characterisation of the urotoxic potency
of various cytostatics
Experimental induction of haemorrhagic cystitis in
the rat with systemic administration. With systemic
administration, the test substances were administered
intravenously or intraperitoneally
depending on their solubility in water. The
highest dose used in each series of tests was
the LD50 for the test substance concerned. The
lower doses, used for determining the dosedependence
of the urotoxic effect, if one was
found, were scaled down in a descending
geometric progression with a decrement factor
of 2.15 (in some cases 1.47).
In order to obtain information on a possible
influence of the physiological milieu (especially
on the pH-dependence) the rats in
some of the experiment series were pre-treated
with NH4C1 (681 mg/kg p.o.) or with
Na2CO 3 (562 mg/kg p.o.) 3 hr before administration
of the test substances. This pretreatment
resulted in highly uniform pH values of
the urine of about 5.0 (NH,C1) and 8.0
(Na2CO3) which were maintained for between
8 and 10 hr.
Assays of alkylating activity in the urine after
systemic administration. In orienting experiments
conducted with a few selected test substances,
the alkylating activity occurring in the urine
within the first hour after systemic administration
was assayed by the NBP test (4,4'-
nitrobenzyl-pyridine) according to Friedman
and Boger [16]. The rats used in these tests
were each given an oral load of 5ml'water
before the test in order to ensure sufficient
enuresis.
Experimental induction of haemorrhagic cystitis in
the rat with intravesical administration. With intravesical
administration the test substances
were instilled in increasing concentrations (increment
factor 3.16) into the urinary bladder
of female rats under Nembutal anaesthesia, by
means of a fine PVC catheter. The urethra
was then clamped shut by means of a fine
clamp, thus ensuring a uniform dwelling time
of the test substances of 1 hr. After the lapse of
this time the bladder was voided by gentle
pressure on the abdomen. Flushing the bladder
was impossible for technical reasons.
The intravesical milieu was adjusted to the
desired pH values (pH 5, 7.4 and 8) by
buffering the test substance solutions in appropriate
isotonic phosphate buffers.
Evaluation
The results were evaluated 24hr after systemic
administration or intravesical instillation
of each test substance. The rats were
killed with CO 2 and laparotomised, and the
bladder was excised.
To evaluate the increase in capillary permeability
in the inflammation area, each rat
was given an intravenous injection of an
aqueous solution of trypan blue (21.5 mg/kg in
3.16 ml/kg) 30 min before being killed.
The evaluation criteria were development
of oedema, increase in capillary permeability
and the occurrence of bleeding. The severity
of the oedema was measured quantitatively by
weighing the bladder (wet weight). The increase
in capillary permeability was measured
quantitatively by extraction and photometric
assay of trypan blue in the extravasal space.
These two criteria were also used as the
basis of a point-scoring system for semiquantitative
macroscopic evaluation. The
point scores ranged from 0 to 3. The severity
of the bladder damage was plotted against the
dose (for systemic administration) or against
the concentration (for intravesical instillation)
and the effective dose ED1. 5 or the effective
concentration F~Cl.s of each test substance,
inducing bladder damage scoring 1.5 points,
were determined graphically. The comparative
urotoxicity of each test substance was
assessed on the basis of these ED1. 5 and Ecl. 5
data.
RESULTS
Pathogenesis and evaluation of the urotoxicity, taking
ifosfamide-induced cystitis as an example
Within a few hours after administration of
598 Norbert Brock, Jo'rg Pohl and Jur O" Stekar
ifosfamide there develops an oedema of the
bladder wall and, owing tO increased capillary
permeability, escape of trypan blue (bound to
plasma albumins) into the exudate. The development
of the oedema is protracted and,
accordingly, the wet weight of the bladder
and the amount of extravasal trypan blue
increase steadily (see Table 2). The inflammatory
i~eaction reaches its peak about 24 hr
after the administration of ifosfamide and then
recedes relatively rapidly within 6-9 days
[17-19]. In other words, the full development
of cystitis requires considerably more time
than the metabolism of ifosfamide and the
renal elimination of the metabolites which
takes its course within a few hours [20-22].
This is confirmed by the investigations with
intravesical administration in which the dwelling
time of the noxious agents in the bladder
was only 1 hr but the peak of damage was only
reached after about 24hr, as with systemic
administration.
After high systemic doses of ifosfamide
(>50mg/kg) the damage to the urinary bladder
exceeds the stage of odema. The observed
changes include necroses of the mucosa, ulcerations
and petechial or confluent
haemorrhages
Bladder weight as criterion of urotoxic damage.
Various authors have used the wet or the dry
weight of the urinary bladder as a quantitative
parameter for assessing urotoxic potency,
in some cases the absolute weight and in
some cases the relative weight referrred to the
body weight [10, 23]. We present in Table 1
the results of a representative experiment with
systemic administration of ifosfamide.
Ifosfamide doses of over 50mg/kg induce
increased incidence and severity of bleeding
and large-area detachments of the urinary
epithelium. The exudate can no longer be
retained in the tissue, and the mean bladder
weight drops accordingly. The weight of the
bladder can therefore be used as a valid

criterion of the urotoxic potency of ifosfamide
only within a limited dosage range, bet,,yeen
about 10 and 50mg/kg.
To illustrate the time-dependence of the
development of oedema, Table 2 presents the
results of experiments in which the rats were
killed at various times after the administration
of ifosfamide. After administration of ifosfamide
the weight of the bladder increases
nearly proportionally to the duration of the
experiment. At high ifosfamide doses, the occurrence
of bleeding and thus ot" losses of
oedema in the tissue is reflected in lesser
increases in the bladder weight with time.
The problems inherent in the use of the bladder
weight as an assessment criterion prompted us to
carry out statistical analyses of the relationships
between the bladder weight, the body weight and the
dosage of the urotoxic agent. These studies will be
reported separately [23].
Extravasation of trypan blue as criterion of urotoxic
damage. The trypan blue administered
intravenously to the rats shortly before they
are killed becomes bound to plasma albumins
intravasally. With the development of oedema
some of the dyestuff escapes into the tissue
together with the plasma proteins. This extravasated
amount of dyestuff can be extracted
and assayed photometrically [24]. It correlates
closely with the increase in the bladder wet
weight. At high doses of ifosfamide

Macroscopic assessment. For these experiments,
involving large numbers of rats, we
devised a semi-quantitative macroscopic assessment
method independent of the quantitative
determinations of the bladder weight
and of the extravasal amount of trypan blue.
With this method the extent of the swelling
and the extent of extravasation of the dyestuff
were assessed visually and were recorded on a
4-point scoring scale ranging from 0 to 3. A
score of 0 was used to describe no swelling
and coloration. A score of 1 was used for a
slight swelling and for a pale blue colour,
corresponding to an increase in the bladder
weights of < 30O/o . A score of 2 was used for
moderate swelling and for a frankly blue
colour, corresponding to an increase in the
bladder weight of between 30 and 60%. A
score of 3 was used for severe swelling and for
a dark blue colour, corresponding to an increase
in the bladder weight of >60%. The
scores of the individual rats of each test group
(of 5 rats) were average~ yielding groupmean
scores of bladder inflammation ranging
between 0 and 3 (Table 3).
Besides these inflammation signs we also
used as an independent criterion the percentage
incidence of bleeding in each test
group.
Urotoxic potency with systemic administration
The oxazaphosphorine cytostatics cyclophosphamide,
trofosfamide, ifosfamide and
sufosfamide are characterised by a high urotoxic
potency (Table 4). Under the experimental
conditions used, bladder damage was demonstrable
at doses as low as 10mg/kg, i.e.,
in the chemotherapeutic dosage range. At
doses corresponding to a mean inflammation
score of 1.5 (~.D1.5>50mg/kg) all the test rats
showed swelling of the urinary bladder associated
with a strong blue coloration.
Haemorrhagic foci were also observed in some
of these bladders.
The common structural feature of the
urotoxically active compounds shown in Table
4 is the oxazaphosphorine ring. The nonchlorinated
and chemotherapeutically inactive
cyclophosphamide analogue ASTA 7019 also
possesses this ring. Despite the absence of
alkylating chlo'roethyl groups, ASTA 7019 does
possess a urotoxic activity.
The primary 4-hydroxy-metabolites of cyclophosphamide,
ifosfamide and ASTA 7019
(ASTA 6635, 6569 and 7169) and the corresponding
4-hydroperoxy-compounds (ASTA
6496, 6760 and 7037), administered intravenously,
also induce dose-dependent bladder
damage. On the other hand, the compound
ASTA Bx 707 which is dimethylated in position
5 of the oxazaphosphorine ring is inactive
both chemotherapeutically and urotoxically.
ASTA Bx 707 does become hydroxylated
in position C-4 of the oxazaphosphorine
ring, but the subsequent cleavage of the ring
with release of acrolein and phosphoric acid
diamide cannot take place [25, 26]. In the
case of the primary metabolites, after the ring
has been opened and acrolein split off by /~-
elimination, the directly alkylating phosphoric
acid diamides ASTA 5317 and ASTA 5',333
are formed. These compounds, when adminis-

The acrolein, which is released concurrently
in these metabolic reactions, is not urotoxic
when administered systemically. Also nonurotoxic
are the metabolic end products 4-

The majority of the very many directly
alkylating compounds which we tested showed
no urotoxic action with i.v. administration,
even at their mean lethal doses (LDso). This
applies in particular to the following compounds
(the data in parentheses are the highest
doses tested, in mg/kg):
NH-mustard (100), mechlorethamine (1.6),
melphalan (18), chlorambucil (8.58), busulfan
(31.6), mannitol-busulfan (1050), mannomustin
(56), triaziquone (0.215), CCNU (40) and
Me-CCNU (40). After high doses of mechlorethamine
oxide (50mg/kg) and of procarbazine
(450mg/kg) we did observe slight oedema
of the bladder but never any bleeding.
The only somewhat more urotoxic compound,
without a clear dose dependence, was the
nitroso-urea derivative BCNU administered
intravenously. The mean scores were <1,
which shows that the inflammation manifestations
were limited and were not observed in
all the rats of a test group (see Table 3).
Assays of the alkylating activity in the urine after
systemic administration
After intravenous administration of some
directly alkylating compounds (at doses
&LDs0), only low alkylating activity levels in
the urine were detected by the NBP test [16].
For example, after i.v. administration of
100 mg/kg NH-mustard ( ~ LDs0 ) only
188nmol (about 0.09% of the dose) was
eliminated renally within the first hour, and
the concentration in the urine was 40nmo-
1/ml. After i.v. administration of 1.6mg/kg
mechlorethamine ( & LDs0) only 7 nmol (about
0.3% of the dose) was eliminated renally
within the first hour, and the concentration in
the urine was 2nmol/ml. The alkylating activity
in the urine was markedly higher after
i.v. administration of 46.4mg/kg mechlorethamine
oxide (~LDs0). Renal excretion within
the first hour after administration
amounted to 10#mol (&4.5% of the dose)
and the urinary concentration was
16.3 #mol/ml.
Urotoxic potency with intravesical administration
For further clarification of the aetiology of
the haemorrhagic oxazaphosphorine-induced
cystitis, the compounds found to be urotoxic
with systemic administration, and the metabolites
and breakdown products of these compounds,
were administered by direct instillation
into the urinary bladder of female rats.
The compounds concerned were administered
in ascending concentration series (increment
factor 2.15 or 3.16).
Control experiments showed that instillation
of isotonic saline or of an isotonic
phosphate buffer in the physiological range
(pH7.4) or in a weekly acidic range (pH5)
induced neither oedema nor a blue coloration
of the urinary bladder. Instillation of alkaline
buffer solutions (pH 8) occasionally induced a
slight increase in the urinary bladder wet
weight accompanied by slight extravasation of
trypan blue.
The observations with intravesical instillation
of urotoxic agents were similar to those
with systemic administration. Urotoxicity manifested
itself by oedema and extravasation of
trypan blue into the tissue. The severity of
the inflammation manifestations was
concentration-dependent. As with systemic administration,
the maximum increase in the
wet weight of the bladder with intravesical
instillation was about two-fold in comparison
with the untreated control rats. At higher
concentrations of the urotoxic agents the incidence
and severity of haemorrhages and
detachments of the urinary epithelium increased.
At such doses the oedema fluid was
no longer retained in the tissue and the wet
weight of the bladder decreased accordingly
again (see also Table 1).
The results of the experiments with intravesical
instillation are summarized in Table
6. Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, administered
intravesically in the form of 2.6%
solution in isotonic saline, induced no inflammation.

chlorinated analogue of cyclophosphamide
(ASTA 7019), instilled intravesically in concentrations
of up to 100#mol/ml, also showed
no urotoxic action.
By oontrast, intravesical administration of
the 4-hydroxy-metabolites induced inflammation
of the urinary bladder, the severity of
which was concentration-dependent. The
urotoxic potency of the 4-hydroxy-metabolite
of the non-chlorinated cyclophosphamide
analogue (ASTA 7169) was about the same as
that of 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide.
Inflammation scoring 1.5 points was induced
by concentration of about 5#mol/ml. The
urotoxic effects of the alkylating phosphoric
acid diamides ASTA 5317 and 5333, on the
other hand, manifest themselves only at concentrations
some 5-10 times higher.
The urotoxically most potent compound
when instilled intravesically was found to be
acrolein, which is not urotoxic when administered
systemically. The urotoxic concentrations
of directly instilled acrolein were
found to be lower by a factor of about 5-10
than the comparable urotoxic concentrations
of the'4-hydroxy-compounds.
In order to obtain information on the influence
of the pH of the instilled solutions on
the severity of the urotoxic effects of the test
compounds, we carried out comparative experiments
in the acidic and in the alkaline pH
range. The use of an isotonic phosphate buffer
pH8 increased the concentration-dependent
urotoxic potency of 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide
and of 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide
by a factor of about 2 in comparison
with the same solutions in an isotonic
phosphate buffer pH 5 (Table 7). By contrast,
the urotoxic potency of the breakdown
products--phosphoric acid diamide and
acrolein--was not affected by changing the
pH.
For comparison purposes, the directly alkylating
compounds NH-mustard, mechlorethamine
and mechlorethamine oxide, which
are not urotoxic with systemic administration
and the alkylating activity of which in the
urine had been determined earlier, were
instilled into the bladder in ascending concentration
series. The data presented in Table
6 show that the concentrations required to
induce urotoxic damage are higher by some
orders of magnitude than those found in the
urine after systemic administration.

DISCUSSION
The development of uroprotective drugs requires
information on whether the urotoxic
action of oxazaphosphorine cytostatics is due
to the alkylating properties of their renally
excreted metabolites or whether it is due to
other breakdown products. The experimental
results on rats presented in this communication
show clearly that systemically administered
directly alkylating cytostatics induce no
renal or vesical damage or induce such damage
only in the systemically toxic dosage
range. The chemical activity of these cytostatics
is so high that they enter into alkylating
reactions with blood and tissue proteins and
are detectable in the urine (NBP test) only in
very low concentrations, if at all. By contrast,
a specific urotoxicity was found with systemic
administration of oxazaphosphorines, but only
of those capable of undergoing ring cleavage
with formation of acrolein. This includes the
"transport forms" cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide,
trofosfamide and sufosfamide as well
as their enzymatically activated primary 4-
hydroxy-derivatives. The non-chlorinated cyclophosphamide
analogue ASTA 5017, which
has no alkylating action component, also possesses
urotoxic potency when administered
systemically. None of the other intermediate
metabolites and end products, such as the
phosphoric acid diamides, the corresponding
4-keto-derivatives and the carboxy-derivatives,
showed any urotoxic potency.
The question of which compounds are directly
responsible for the renal and vesical
damage was clarified in experiments with
direct instillation of test compounds into the
bladder. As expected in view of their nature,
the inactive "transport forms" such as cyclophosphamide
and ifosfamide were fully tolerated
when administered intravesically. The
directly alkylating phosphoric acid diamides,
formed by ring cleavage of cyclophosphamide
and ifosfamide, were found to possess only a
low urotoxic potency. The specific urotoxicity
carriers are only the primary 4-hydroxymetabolites
and especially acrolein which is
formed by their further degradation. Acrolein
is the compound with the highest urotoxic
potency. The reason why acrolein is not urotoxic
when administered systemically is its high
reactivity. As a result, systemically administered
acrolein is rapidly detoxified in the
blood and tissues and does not appear in the
urine in a reactive form.
Of particular importance for the clarification
of structure/action relationships are the
findings with the compound ASTA Bx 707
which is dimethylated in position 5 of the
oxazaphosphorine ring. After systemic administration,
this compound does undergo enzymatic
hydroxylation in position 4 in the liver
of warm-blooded animals, but fi-elimination
with subsequent formation of acrolein cannot
occur for structural reasons [26].
The findings of the experiments presented
in the communication support the following
interpretation of the urotoxicity of oxazaphosphorine
cytostatics:
With systemic administration of the transport
forms cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, trofosfamide
and sufosfamide, the decisively important
event for the formation of urotoxic
metabolites is the first metabolic step, i.e.,
enzymatic hydroxylation in position 4 of the
oxazaphosphorine ring. Non-metabolised fractions
of the transport forms, as well as the 4-
keto-, carboxy- and phosphoric acid diamide
compounds, are also eliminated renally but
possess no urotoxic potency. As show by the
experiments with direct intravesical instillation,
urotoxic potency is possessed only by
the renally eliminated fractions of the 4-
hydroxy metabolites and by acrolein which is
formed from these metabolites spontaneously
in the kidneys and in the efferent urinary
tract.
It was found both in the experiments with
systemic administration and in those with
direct intravesical instillation that the potency
of the urotoxic action is pH-dependent. It is
substantially stronger in the alkaline range
than in the acidic range.
