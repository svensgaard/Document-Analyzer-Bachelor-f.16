Abstract- The presence of HS V-2 DNA was investigated in ten dysplasias and five genital
tumours by the blotting technique. The sensitivity of the technique employed could reveal 0.5
viral genome equivalents per diploid cell genome. Viral DNA was not detected in any of the
tested tumours.
INTRODUCTION
STUDIES on the relationship between
cervicocarcinomas and genital infections by
Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2), and
other sporadic reports on labial carcinomas
developing at the site of herpetic recurrences,
support the hypothesis of an association between
Herpes Simplex Virus and human tumours [1].
The significant association between HSV and
cervicocarcinomas is supported in the literature
by the fact that sera from women affected by such
tumours show higher antibody titers to HSV-2
than control sera [2-4], although such a
relationship has not been found in all the
populations examined [3, 4]. Other substantial
elements exist to support the association between
HSV-2 and cervicocarcinomas. It has been
shown that tumours contain not only structural
viral antigens [5], but also early viral antigens [6]
and non-virionic antigens [7]. A search for viral
nucleic acids in human cancer cells has so far been
successful only in a large (70 g) exophytic cervical
squamous cell carcinoma [8]. Analysis of the
nucleic acids extracted from the tumour by
renaturation kinetics with labeled viral DNA
revealed that only a fragment of the viral genome
was present in the tumour cells and that a small
portion of the fragment was transcribed.

Unfortunately, such a technique requires a large
quantity of pathologic material and results are
severely affected by experimental conditions [9].
In fact Hansen et al. [10] tested human tumours
for the presence of HSV DNA by the same
technique, but with different experimental
conditions, and obtained negative results.
McDougall et al. [11] have examined sections of
cervical cancer biopsies for evidence of HSVspecific
RNA and have found hybridization of
3H-labeled HSV-2 DNA to RNA in cells within
areas of abnormal tissue.
In this study we analysed 50 genital dysplasias
for the presence of HSV, and ten dysplasias, four
cervical tumours and one vulva tumour for both
the presence of HSV as infectious particles and for
the presence ofHSV DNA. To detect the presence
of viral DNA in tumour cells we employed the blot
transfer technique originally described by
Southern [12]. Such a technique allowed us to
work with small quantities of pathologic material.
The vulva tumour was also analysed by DNADNA
reassociation kinetics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical tumours
For our survey, 28 cases were selected whose
histological reports showed a cervical cancer, a
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or a cervical
dysplasia, as indicated in Fig 1. In this figure we
have also specified the relationship with the
cytological report which, in eight cases, showed
only inflammatory modifications. In all these
