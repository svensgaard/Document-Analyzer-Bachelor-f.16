  kofi annan the secretary general of the united nations recently called attention to  the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the  challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the united nations and  the world scientific community closer to each other annan      mr annan stressed the  importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing  countries asserting that “this unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates  serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries but for  development itself ” indeed mr annan s sentiments have also been echoed recently by  several scientists who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific  output between the developing and already developed countries gibbs      may  goldemberg      riddoch      for example recent united nations educational scientific  and cultural organization unesco estimates unesco      indicate that in      the  developed countries accounted for some    of the global investment in scientific research  and development had approximately    of the world researchers and produced approximately     of all scientific and technical publications registered by the science citation index  sci north america and europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications  produced annually with      and      respectively worldwide unesco  north america and europe clearly dominate the number of scientific  publications produced annually  it is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science  and therefore account for the largest number of publications it is also likely that there  is a statistical bias on the part of the sci as a bibliometric database since it  represents north american and european publications far better than those of the rest of  the world gibbs      may      alonso and fernández juricic      vohora and vohora       but is the disparity in scientific contributions between the developed and  developing worlds actually remaining unchanged or even increasing as mr annan has  implied a closer look at the trends over the last decade reveals important advances in  developing countries for example latin america and china although representing  respectively only     and   of scientific publications worldwide have increased the  number of their publications between      and      by    and    respectively which is a  much higher percentage than the increments reached by europe    and industrial asia     the percentage of global scientific publications from north america actually  decreased by   over the same period unesco  publishing trends in the americas  using the sci databases produced by the institute for scientific information isi as  well as data compiled by the red iberoamericana de indicadores de ciencia y tecnología  ricyt we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific  publications between the developed world and the developing world from      until  focusing on the americas as a case study not surprisingly there was a huge disparity in  the number of publications from      until      with the united states contributing the  lion s share      followed by canada       latin america as a whole contributed  only      to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years ricyt  the total number of publications however is not necessarily the best measure for  assessing scientific productivity or technical advances may      more relevant  measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of  publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research  and development may      the proportional change in the number of publications using       as a comparison revealed that scientific publishing in latin america increased the  most rapidly in the americas far outpacing the united states and canada figure  further analyses correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money  invested in research and development for each region also show that in contrast to both  canada and united states the trend in latin america has been an increase in relative  output throughout the     s figure   moreover when taking into account the amount of  research money available to researchers latin america actually out published the united  states and canada by the year      figure   although the cost of research is undoubtedly  cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries overhead and  other work standards these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number  of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in latin america  particularly from      until      figure  other relative indicators of scientific productivity such as the number of publications  picked up by the sci in relation to the number of scientists in a particular country also  demonstrate that such developing regions as latin america are making substantial  contributions to science despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic  product gdp invested in science in latin america throughout this    year period was only     of the amount invested in united states ricyt      indeed this scientific  productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science  itself as compared with the gdp of latin america as a whole in fact albornoz  concluded that as a group latin america could afford to invest a much higher proportion  of its resources in scientific research and development latin american investment in  research and development represented only      of the regional gdp in      a very weak  effort compared with that of the united states      and canada  among latin american countries there is a high degree of variability in publication  rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology some countries have  performed particularly well for example uruguay chile panama and cuba averaged  respectively             and     publications per million dollars of research and  development investment in the    years studied which is notoriously high compared with  united states     and even canada     ricyt      other countries such as costa  rica cuba brazil and chile have invested a much greater proportion of their gdp in  research and development than the other countries of this region albornoz  why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and  development been increasing in latin america while decreasing in united states and  canada  explaining the increase in publishing productivity in latin america  one potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in latin america  is that scientific development during the     s was particularly strong for many countries  of this region indeed this would explain the rapid rise in the number of publications in  latin america compared with the relatively flat increases in the united states and canada  which were publishing just as well at the beginning of the decade a potentially more  important question however is why the number of publications per dollar invested in  research and development has been increasing in latin america while decreasing in the  united states and canada this pattern could be the result of a variety of factors none of  which are mutually exclusive it is possible that publishing in international journals as a  measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in latin america increased  funding to the most productive scientists from the national science development programs  might have been an important stimulus international cooperation resulting in more  scientific collaborations among scientists in latin america europe and the united states  may also have increased the relative number of publications in latin america in contrast  the decreasing trends in the number of publications per investment dollar in canada and  united states could reflect a trend towards more costly research in larger scientific  programs  scientific impact from latin america  what exactly is the relative impact of such developing regions as latin america on the  scientific community we used sci      data to examine the proportion of publications in  the area of ecology including the fields of evolutionary biology conservation biology  and global change biology between      and      in both the two top general science  journals  nature and  science with impact factors of       and       respectively and in  the    top ecological journals with impact factors of      –     isi     a we credited  a region with a publication if any of the authors were affiliated with institutions from  that region thus more than one region would receive credit for a single publication if  that publication had been written by multiple authors from institutions of different  regions  for the top    ecological journals the american subcontinents of south central and  north america accounted for    of the publications worldwide within the americas  however latin america represented only   while canada and united states accounted  respectively for    and    of the top    ecological publications when we examined the  data as contributions to the top    ecological journals impact factors      –     versus  the top   –   impact factors     –     the latin american countries contributed nearly  twice as many publications to journals in the second category   in the top   –   compared  with   in the top    these findings suggest that publications from such developing  regions as latin america are falling short of reaching the top journals in contrast the  united states contributed somewhat more publications to the top    journals    than the  top   –   journals    the difference in the proportion of publications contributed by  the united states to the top    and top    journals was even more pronounced when we  examined it in respect to worldwide publications in this case the united states  contributed    of the publications to the top    journals and only    of the publications  to the top   –   journals  interestingly the proportion of publications from latin america the united states and  canada across all subject areas in  science and  nature were nearly identical to those of the top    ecological journals  in  science and  nature latin america had   of the publications within the americas  versus   in the top    ecological journals whereas the united states and canada had  versus    and    versus    respectively these similarities suggest that the latin  american researchers are not shying away from the two top ranked general science journals  however publishing in  science and  nature was not enough to gain prominence as evidenced by the number of  citations of these researchers the latest list of the     most cited researchers in  ecology and environmental sciences emphasizes the overwhelming contributions of authors  from north america    and europe    isi     b no researcher working in a latin  american institution was included in the remaining   overall these data indicate that  the scientific output in the field of ecology in latin america is having a relatively low  impact in the international scientific community and is underrepresented in the top  international journals despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of  publications per researcher funding amount similar findings were also reported for asia  swinbanks et al      and thus could be a general phenomenon in the developing world  although there are outstanding scientific researchers in the developing world who  independently are making important contributions to the international scientific community  they are the exception why in general do latin american scientists often fail to reach  the top journals or become amongst the most cited researchers in their fields one  possibility is that the main research agendas between both regions are somewhat different  and that the top journals which are published in the developed world respond more to the  scientific mainstream of the developed regions this is not to suggest any sort of  conspiracy but rather it implies that the perception of the most important science is  linked to the region and that because the major funding agencies as well as most prominent  journals share a similar economic region they also share the same perception of what  science is most interesting to them another consideration is that more local journals from  developed regions are listed by the sci than similar journals from developing regions  gibbs      consequently there are more high profile regional publication opportunities  available to scientists from the developed region whereas much of the research published  locally in the developing world is overlooked but it takes more than publishing good  papers to become a highly cited scientist it requires attending international meetings and  introducing novel research findings in multiple scientific forums funding these  activities however requires a greater proportion of research money being spent on  meetings for researchers in the developing compared with the developed world  a long road yet to travel  the positive trends in scientific productivity in latin america should not be  misinterpreted as a reason to be unconcerned about the existing gap highlighted by mr  annan there are many compelling reasons for the push to increase scientific input from the  developing world goldemberg      annan      one is that science as a discipline would  benefit from the contributions of many disparate groups around the world rather than being  dominated by two geographic regions many scientific problems could be solved much more  readily with the cooperation and scientific insight of scientists from developing regions  climate change and biodiversity research for example urgently need the scientific input  from those developing regions that are so important for these global processes it is also  critical for the developing world to promote through research and publications those  areas of concern that are having a proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon  them there are now examples in which research on priority areas for the developing nations  can actually become pioneering work in areas neglected by the research agenda of the  industrialized world this has been the case for research on renewable energy sources in  brazil goldemberg      and biomedical sciences in cuba castro díaz balart      these  examples are important not only for those regions of the developing world but are also in  themselves scientific innovations that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the  world  climate change and biodiversity research urgently need the scientific  input from those developing regions that are so important for global processes  although the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a long way to go before  developing countries contribute a more equitable share to the international scientific  community there are also reasons to be optimistic the relative increase in the number of  publications especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and  development demonstrates that many developing countries are heading in the right  direction the extremely high scientific productivity of many developing nations corrected  for and despite the rather limited availability of funds suggests that increased funding  to the sciences will be an excellent investment by developing nations in terms of  publications as a measure of scientific output particularly if these publications can  target the journals that have the greatest impact although there may still be a long road  to travel we feel optimistic that the bridges mentioned by mr annan are slowly being  built
