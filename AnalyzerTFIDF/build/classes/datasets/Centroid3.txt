  selling land to jews   last week a    year old palestinian real estate dealer was murdered after he violated a new edict by the palestinian authority making the sale of arab owned land to jews a capital crime the issue of land sales has a long history as a subtheme of the jewish arab struggle   the    th century jewish intellectuals who conceived of zionism the idea that jewish survival depends on the establishment of a jewish state in the biblical land of israel never worked out their ideology s logistics jewish settlement in palestine then part of the decaying ottoman empire only proceeded piecemeal in the     s and     s about        jews immigrated to palestine most integrated into multiethnic communities in the cities of jaffa tiberias and jerusalem a second wave of        immigrants came between      and      many of whom were labor zionists who wanted the jewish state to be socialist extolling the virtues of manual labor they acquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee syrian and lebanese landlords the new palestinian jew they said needed to be physically tougher than the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in europe   the jewish national fund was founded in      for the purpose of buying up land from arabs after the ottoman empire s defeat in world war i britain acquired palestine and promised in the balfour declaration the creation of a jewish state in anticipation jews in palestine began laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity the jewish national fund s charter was amended to mandate that jewish land could never be resold to arabs or opened to non jewish employees   following jewish national fund guidelines farmers evicted palestinian peasants living on the newly acquired plots the total number displaced was small by      jews owned only   percent of palestine but the perceived threat of displacement was widespread among arabs starting around      arab newspapers railed against jewish land acquisition among the peasantry rumors spread alleging an anglo jewish conspiracy to remove muslims from palestine anxious to avoid being blamed for palestinian landlessness british officials began imposing token restrictions on jewish land purchase in      they publicly supported arab complaints that jews were driving arabs off the land  palestinians say evictions destroyed their way of life forcing them to move from rural palestine to crowded cities in search of work they also say that the better educated jewish buyers had duped illiterate peasants into selling property   the arab national fund created in      by wealthy arab families to purchase land for displaced peasants was ineffective during the     s palestinian responses turned violent in      jerusalem s mufti the spiritual leader of the city s muslims decreed that believers were duty bound to murder other muslims who sold land to jews arabs who outnumbered jews by more than   to revolted against jewish land acquisition and british promises of jewish nationhood about       arabs and several hundred jews were killed in riots and guerrilla attacks between      and   zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all the territory s residents jewish immigrants introduced modern agricultural technology which increased productivity and helped fill the markets with food to feed the growing arab population zionists also maintain that jews became a lucrative market for arab manufactured goods   some historians trace palestinian landlessness to palestine s entry into the world economy in the     s urban commerce drew some peasants from their family farms other subsistence farmers found themselves competing with cash crop entrepreneurs jews and arabs whose successes changed the face of palestinian agriculture jewish land purchases were not the primary factor these historians say  very little of the land owned today by individual jews and the israeli government was acquired by purchase jewish sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are by war israel confiscated all land owned by the british government mostly desert and mountains after the      war of independence property owned by arab refugees who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the israeli army another long standing controversy was also taken over by individual jews or confiscated by the government many palestinians however stayed put retained their land and became israeli citizens   a new school of jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by jewish land acquisition and concludes that it was not always fair one popular theory compares zionism s imperative to acquire land to the american idea of manifest destiny that it was the united states god given right to rule from coast to coast others argue that it was a mistake for the jewish national fund to prohibit non jewish laborers from the newly purchased lands however even these revisionists agree that the jews had not intended to evict muslims from palestine   israeli security officials believed that the murdered real estate dealer was executed by plainclothes palestinian authority police the palestinian authority s decision to make the sale of land to jews a capital crime reflects palestinian frustration with israeli land use specifically the creation of a new jewish neighborhood now under construction in east jerusalem   in the past death threats have done little to deter sales of land according to british land records the jerusalem mufti s      decree failed to prevent sales but that decree did not have the power of civil law behind it nevertheless the incentives to sell at the market price are substantial and if the threats create new scarcities higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unload their land

  october  name address city st zip  dear name  in the summer of      the marion county commission on youth began  what can best be described as a new era in its history mccoy was  reorganized as an independent not for profit agency separate from local  government it retained however the same mission with which it had been  charged from its inception to serve as a catalyst for effective  coordinated and collaborative service delivery to youth in our  community  for the past three years mccoy has been actively engaged in  accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others  youth service providers youth funding bodies and interested citizens  to name a few  we have met with a number of successes along the way most notably the  summer fun line the metro summer bus pass and the development of ten  neighborhood youth councils a providers council and a youth coalition  are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the  years to come the formation of the community academy a pilot project  directed at expelled students from local school systems has come about  as a result of mccoy s efforts to mobilize community agencies in response  to a pressing issue  mccoy is actively represented and working with numerous community  collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the  inclusion of young people in both decision making and program planning  processes one concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the  united northwest area in partnership with the junior league of  indianapolis and community partnerships with youth from fort wayne  indiana as a team these three organizations are working with  neighborhood youth and adults to build a caring neighborhood with youth  mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a  better neighborhood for all  since its re organization mccoy has established its unique niche  within the community by refraining from direct service programming and  focusing on what it does best helping to identify youth needs convening  groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs  and moving toward collaborative solutions mccoy has only one interest  the well being of marion county s young people  mccoy invites the support of the company foundation in the amount  of           to support such activities as  the co ordination of youth leadership training and youth  empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of  neighborhood based youth councils the promotion of youth employment  opportunities the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding  effective and efficient youth service delivery  the provision of technical assistance and guidance to  neighborhoods which seek positive youth adult relationships  the development of community wide supports for the positive  growth of all marion county young people  in the last several years the business and corporate community has  recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to  the development of a competent workforce youth who are supported and  encouraged by both a family and a society that values  them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and  contributing members of adult society while we have made significant  inroads there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do  it alone we seek the financial support of the foundation to help us be  successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people  can grow and develop well your contribution will enable us to both  continue and expand the good work we have begun in making indianapolis a  city famous for its commitment to youth and families  in our fund raising efforts to date we have received the support of  local government foundations and corporations as well as the personal  financial commitments of individual mccoy board members we believe there  is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative  effort to financially support the services mccoy offers to the community  as a whole  thanking you in advance for your support we remain  sincerely  john t neighbours philip b roby president treasurer  john f brandon executive director

  i’m outraged and i think you will be too  just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slow acting poison spread in fields miles away  and who plans to commit such a mass bird killing  the u s department of agriculture  in fact the usda has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern great plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly    other bird species  it’s almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like ddt have had on wildlife and people  thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring but the usda’s plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration unless we act now  let me tell you exactly what’s at stake and how this could set a dangerous precedent first of all you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the migratory bird treaty act’s prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm  you see the usda found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for “experimental” activities  so they applied for the right to spread poison as dart of a “scientific experiment” to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss  can you believe it the usda wants to conduct an “experiment” that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds  and if the death of two million birds doesn’t “prove” their theory and show a reduction in crop loss they’ll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year  it’s time to tell the usda in no uncertain terms  “you will not conduct massive bird kills  to benefit a handful of special interests ”  because the usda’s slow acting pesticide takes three days to kill its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields before falling to the ground  meanwhile blackbirds aren’t the only birds threatened directly by the poison we’ve noted the presence of    other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poison baited areas including the bobolink grasshopper sparrow harris’ sparrow and le conte’s sparrow  in all nine birds on the federal threatened or endangered lists and    birds on audubon’s watchlist of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields  we simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife  here’s what i need you to do to make sure we prevail first i need you to sign and return your petition to the u s secretary of agriculture  i’ll forward your petition along with those from thousands of other audubon members and supporters urging the usda to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds in favor of alternative benign methods of protecting sunflower crops  i can assure you that thousands of audubon petitions can make a difference just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago  but today’s battle is one we must win to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase    years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment  that’s why i hope you’ll also agree to help even more by making a tax deductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of audubon’s vital conservation work to protect birds other wildlife and habitat and with a donation of    or more you’ll receive a free birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern  i’ll make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to  ·win a ban on the usda bird poisoning  ·gain strict enforcement of wildlife laws  ·ensure wildlife programs are based on sound science  ·monitor the health of audubon’s watchlist species  ·conserve america’s remaining grassland habitat  and audubon will draw upon its century long track record of highly effective conservation work to make a real difference in other key areas  audubon protects birds your help will be instrumental to our bird conservation work designating important bird areas to protect vital habitat maintaining the watchlist of bird species near endangered status www audubon org bird watch and engaging citizen participation in the vast birdsource database of north american bird trends  audubon rescues endangered wildlife nearly    years ago the national audubon society helped win passage of the endangered species act with your help audubon will remain committed to wildlife laws and regulations that are well funded properly implemented and strongly enforced  audubon establishes and protects wildlife refuges and sanctuaries “audubon is truly making a difference for wildlife refuges everywhere” says u s fish and wildlife official rick coleman and your support will help sustain our innovative audubon refuge keepers program and maintain our own network of more than     wildlife centers and sanctuaries  audubon restores wetlands wetlands are not only crucial to wildlife they also help purify our drinking water and prevent billions of dollars worth of flood damage your gift today will help us reach our goal to restore one million acres of irreplaceable wetlands  audubon educates the public teaching americans particularly young people how to become better stewards of our environment is one of the best investments that you and i can make for wildlife that’s why we’re expanding our network of audubon centers to reach children and adults in every corner of the nation  and of course your support will enable audubon to stand ready to act whenever a wildlife crisis emerges  like the usda’s bird poisoning proposal that i’m asking you to help us defeat today  so let me urge you to do your part by supporting a group that the san francisco chronicle calls “one of america’s most respected and influential conservation organizations  first sign and return your petition to the secretary of agriculture immediately to declare a firm and resounding “no ” to the usda’s bird poisoning plan  and i also hope you’ll take a second important step today by supporting audubon’s vital conservation

  alaska emergency  dear defender  look closely at this photo and you’ll see a wolf running soon this wolf won’t be merely running in the snow  this wolf will be running for its life  the airplane above will be tracking her in order to land and immediately gun her down  you see the alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a    trapping or    hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down this cruel unethical wolf hunting practice is called “same day airborne land and shoot ”  it was a total shock and surprise  in may the alaska legislature voted to reinstate same day airborne wolf killing frankly we never thought alaska’s anti wolf politicians would go this far but they did overriding governor tony knowles’ veto — and ignoring the will of the majority of alaska’s citizens  unfortunately this practice will begin after the first snow this september when wolves will be “can’t miss” targets against alaska’s snowy terrain wolves can run fast — but they certainly can’t outrun airplanes  given the urgency of the situation in alaska defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save alaska’s wolves from same day airborne land and shoot slaughter  support the emergency effort to save alaska’s wolves  defenders hopes to raise at least         to help alaskans for wildlife a coalition of alaska citizens win a citizens’ ballot initiative this november and we face very wealthy opponents so today i urge you to do these two things  first sign the enclosed citizens’ advisory ballot to show our alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on “same day airborne  land and shoot” wolf killing in alaska  second rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in november  the alaska legislature is completely out of step with the will of alaska’s citizens and the american public at large  like you the majority of alaskans oppose same day land and shoot wolf killing but the anti wolf politicians in the alaska legislature don’t care what the majority of alaska citizens want and they didn’t listen to the recommendations of the alaska department of fish and game which opposed this legislation  they are utterly out of step with their alaska constituents the state agency that manages alaska wildlife and the rest of the american public  in the name of “wolf control ” wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion so that the wolves have literally no chance of survival  and if history is any guide over the years thousands of alaska’s wolves will be brutally killed  before the      ban on same day land and shoot as many as     wolves were killed in alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice  anti wolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new land and shoot law stands — even though most alaskans do not support it  so if we don’t act right now alaska’s snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in america’s “last frontier ”  say “no” to the barbaric practice of same day airborne wolf killing  the only way alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on same day airborne land and shoot wolf killing is with a citizens’ referendum  that’s why your special financial support is so important — and urgently needed  alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves  as i mentioned this new same day airborne land and shoot practice will start in september after the opening of hunting season and the first snow — and when wolves will be an easy target  to repeal this unconscionable law defenders must help provide our friends in alaska alaskans for wildlife — with the resources necessary to win at the polls in november  our well funded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure we need help to supplement the funds raised by alaskans for wildlife for careful polling the development of voter education spots for television radio and newspapers the placement of those ads and “get out the vote” efforts on election day  if alaska’s new law is not replaced thousands of alaska s wolves will die in the years to come  and it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide — at a time when the american public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection a loss will encourage those anti wolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild  so please don’t wait another minute  please sign your citizens’ advisory ballot to demonstrate to our alaska allies that you’re behind them and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort  so how will your money be spent  here’s the projected budget breakdown         — in depth state wide survey conducted by a top pollster to determine voters’ positions on the ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecided voters         — salaries office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day         — production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey          — placement of voter education spots in the key media including print radio and television money must be in hand by mid august to reserve time for september and october         — election day “get out the vote” drive including phone calls to get voters to the polls  you stood by defenders when we defeated the wealthy american farm bureau in court and saved the lives of the wolves in yellowstone national park and central idaho  now i’m hoping i can count on your moral and financial support again today to help save alaska’s wolves from same day airborne land and shoot killing  your special donation today is absolutely critical because many of alaska’s politicians clearly have anti wolf agendas they have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of alaska and the american public  please let alaskans know that you’re behind them let them know you share their concern about protecting alaska’s wolves  please help save alaska’s wolves by doing these two things    sign the enclosed citizens’ advisory ballot to show your support  for repealing “same day airborne land and shoot” wolf killing in alaska    rush a special donation to help our alaska allies overturn this odious new law  remember for this emergency effort to succeed we must act immediately  so please take out your pen right now and sign your absentee ballot and then mail it back to us along with your emergency donation to help save alaska’s wolves  thank you for your strong support  sincerely  rodger schlickeisen  president  p s defenders needs your help to raise         in emergency funds to help ensure that the coalition’s emergency effort to save alaska’s wolves succeeds so please sign the  enclosed citizens’ advisory ballot to lend your moral support to our alaska friends and return it in the enclosed envelope with a special donation time is so short

states hsus are very important to the well being of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives  i wish i could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earth’s animals dogs cats farm animals and wildlife the sad truth is animal cruelty abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community  every day of the year the humane society of the united states receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties such as the horrors of the leghold trap the use of dog and cat fur needless or repetitive experiments on animals and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats  still others are less obvious but just as horrible dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers baby calves confined and malnourished to provide “milk fed” veal for the gourmet and the “accidental” drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen and almost           companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout america  what is even more shocking is that more than    million animals die these cruel painful deaths each year needless deaths that could have been stopped  and with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on i’m sure you can understand why the work of the humane society of the united states is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people like you to help us bring an end to animal suffering abuse and neglect  since      our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties  we also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty  our primary goal though has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering abuse and exploitation  but while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources  it’s a difficult problem because we have to fight the well financed and powerful agri business and research industries but we do our best to protect the animals  right now the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty  and that’s where you can help you can be a lifesaving “friend” to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of the hsus and asking them to become vigilant in safe guarding the lives of all animals  today we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption i hope you will visit your local animal shelter and consider adopting a dog or cat into your home it’s a wonderful way to enjoy their companionship and save the life of a loving animal too  i also hope you will give a big boost to our work to protect all animals by sending a generous tax deductible donation today your gift of at least   or    or even

  introduction  older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight  even though there is little evidence that overweight is  associated with increased mortality in those over age  six large controlled population based studies of  non smoking older adults have investigated the association  between body mass index bmi and mortality controlling  for relevant covariates             all studies found  excess risk for persons with very low bmi but that persons  with moderately high bmi had little or no extra risk except  in certain small subsets a review of    studies of older  adults drew similar conclusions  many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain  throughout adult life it may be that a small amount of  gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the  most robust health as we age it has been suggested that  weight standards be adjusted upwards for age   such  recommendations remain controversial however because the  number of studies of older persons is fairly small and  because few studies have examined the relation of bmi to  quality of life or years of healthy life yhl in the  elderly  in older adults risk factors may have a greater effect  on health than on mortality if so then behavior change  trials of weight modification might be more successful if  they were evaluated on improved health rather than on  decreased mortality clinical trials powered to detect  differences in yhl would often require fewer subjects than  trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular  events    in this paper we study whether bmi at  baseline is associated with living longer and or with more  years of being healthy in a cohort of older adults for  whom risk factors subclinical disease and morbidity are  well characterized the goal is to determine whether  analyses based on years of life yol or on yhl would  provide substantively different results and which measure  would yield more powerful evaluations of weight  modification interventions in older adults  materials and methods  study design the cardiovascular health  study  the cardiovascular health study chs is a  population based longitudinal study of       adults aged     and older at baseline    subjects were recruited  from a random sample of the medicare eligibility lists in  four us counties extensive baseline data were collected  for all subjects using a baseline home interview an  annual mail questionnaire and annual clinic  examinations additional information was collected in a  brief telephone interview   months after each scheduled  visit two cohorts were followed one with   years of  follow up n       and the second all african  american n     with   years of follow up to date  data collection began in      and follow up is virtually  complete for all surviving subjects  body mass index  bmi was calculated as measured weight in kilograms  divided by the square of measured height in meters a  report from the national heart lung and blood institute  classifies normal weight without reference to age as a  bmi of      to      overweight as    to      and  obesity as      and higher    we consider  separately the group with bmi between      and    which  was associated with lower survival in studies cited  above  years of life and years of healthy life  yol is the number of years that a person lived in the    years after baseline yhl is the number of years in  which the person was healthy and is similar in concept  to quality adjusted life years healthy year equivalents  or active life expectancy    we based yhl on  self rated health is your health excellent very good  good fair or poor evgfp which was collected every  months evgfp is a simple but well known measure which  has been studied in detail       and is predictive  of health events in many studies    because we are  examining health status over time we added a sixth  health state dead data were available about    of the  time we used linear interpolation to estimate missing  data when there were known values before and after the  missing value bringing the percent complete to  for this analysis we defined yhl as the number of  years of   in which a person reported excellent very  good or good health were healthy yhl ranges from  for persons who were never in excellent very good or  good health to   years for persons who were healthy  throughout since people reported their health every  months yhl has a reasonably continuous distribution a  drawback of this simple definition of healthy is that  it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and  death since all are considered not healthy we also  used an alternative approach which assigns a different  value to each level of evgfp    preliminary results  were similar for the two approaches however and we  report results using only the simpler definition  the calculations had to be modified to include the  persons in the second african american cohort who have  been followed only   years to date for those persons  and for    persons in the first cohort who did not have  complete data we estimated the last   years of yol and  yhl from their age sex and health at the end of  years using validated methods presented elsewhere  that article showed that estimated   year yol and yhl  were unbiased for the african american cohort in the  primary analysis we used observed   year yol and yhl when  they were available and observed   year yol and yhl plus    year estimated yol and yhl when they were not about     of the sample we performed all analyses with and  without the persons who had partially estimated data to  ensure that the estimation had not distorted the  findings  covariates  the goal is to examine the association of yol and yhl  with bmi to adjust for possible confounding we chose  baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly  related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies  and likely to be related to bmi self reported covariates  include age gender smoking never or former history  of arthritis cancer diabetes fair or poor self rated  health status limitations in activities of daily living  or in instrumental activities of daily living and  pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before  baseline clinical covariates include hypertension  cardiovascular disease prevalent heart disease  peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease  maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery  depression cesd score serum albumin serum  cholesterol and serum creatinine these measures are  explained in more detail elsewhere             we  excluded     current smokers and     others with  incomplete covariate data leaving       persons on whom  this analysis is based  analysis  all analyses were performed separately for men and  women we calculated two sets of adjusted values as  follows we regressed yol and yhl first on age age  squared race and smoking history former or never and  second on all of the covariates listed above we  calculated adjusted yol as a person s observed yol minus  predicted yol from the regression plus the mean yol       years for women or      for men that is a  person s adjusted yol is his residual from the regression  plus the grand mean the mean of this new variable for a  group of subjects is the adjusted mean yol for that  group adjusted yhl was calculated in a similar manner  we calculated two sets of adjusted variables because of  the possibility of over adjustment controlling  inappropriately for factors such as diabetes which may  have been causally affected by the person s weight we  plotted mean adjusted yol and yhl against bmi and tested  for difference among bmi groups using confidence  intervals or analysis of variance finally we calculated  the effect size for each measure comparing each bmi  subgroup to the normal group the effect size is the  difference in mean yol or yhl in two groups divided by  their common standard deviation since the sample size  required to detect an effect of this magnitude is  proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size  large effect sizes are desirable  results  table  shows the distribution of key variables by sex  and race mean age at baseline was      and about two  thirds of the men and a third of the women were former  smokers black women had a higher mean bmi and higher  percent obese bmi ≥    than the other three groups black  men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than     pounds in the past year white women were least  likely  about    of the subjects were healthy at baseline  declining to    at the end of   years    had died data  not shown of the    who were unhealthy fair or poor at  baseline about    were healthy   years later there was  thus substantial change in evgfp over time in both  directions table  shows the mean yol and yhl calculated  from evgfp in the first seven years of the study adjusted  to age    for example black women averaged     yol but  only     yhl of a maximum possible   we calculated some  additional descriptive statistics shown in the final two  lines years of unhealthy life yol minus yhl and years  lost to death   minus yol white women had the most yhl  and black men the fewest black women had the most years of  unhealthy life and white men the fewest black men lost  the most years to death     out of   while white women  lost only     years for blacks about    of their yol  were healthy yhl yol not shown for whites about  were healthy  among whites the gender differences in table  were  statistically significant p    except for bmi and  unintended weight loss among blacks gender differences  were significant except for    pounds unintended weight  loss and weight loss since age    among males there were  significant differences between black and white for bmi  unintended weight loss yol yhl years of unhealthy life  and years lost to death whites in the sample had higher  income and education data not shown after adjusting for  income and education as well as age and former smoking  the difference in bmi was no longer statistically  significant among females blacks and whites differed  significantly on bmi bmi    weight loss since age  yol yhl years of unhealthy life and years lost to death  after adjustment for income and education the difference  in weight loss since age    was no longer significant  blacks had significantly lower yol and yhl than whites  after adjustment for age but the difference disappeared  after adjustment for the entire set of health related  baseline covariates analyses not shown  we next examined the relationship of bmi to yol and yhl  table  presents the mean values of yol and yhl adjusted  for age race and previous smoking columns   and   and  also adjusted for the entire set of covariates columns  and   for example yol for women adjusted for age race  and smoking averaged     years for women with a baseline  bmi below      but averaged     years for women with a bmi  from    to      the second column which shows results  adjusted for all covariates is not very different the  only discrepancy is for men with bmi      a category  containing only    men adjustment for extensive  covariates also made little difference for yhl columns  and   subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age  race and former smoking as mentioned above the group  with bmi from      to    would be considered normal by  the nhlbi guidelines but had lower yol and yhl than those  with         in all comparisons for this reason and to  increase sample size for those with low bmi we combined  the two lower categories defining underweight as a bmi  under  figure  is a plot of adjusted yol and yhl by sex and  bmi for each bmi category the mean and its    confidence  interval are plotted categories whose confidence intervals  do not overlap or overlap only slightly are significantly  different the bars are slightly offset to permit all error  bars to be seen  yol for women the uppermost curve on figure   averaged  about     out of   years and showed no evident association  between bmi and yol for bmi above    underweight women  averaged about    fewer yol than other women p  compared with normal group underweight men also had lower  yol but this group was not significantly different from  the normal group in part because of low sample size men  classified as normal overweight or obese all had about the  same yol  the lowermost two lines in figure  show mean yhl for  women and men women who were normal or overweight averaged  about     yhl the yhl for underweight or obese women was  about     years which was significantly lower than the  normal group the relationship of bmi to yhl for men is  similar but differences among bmi groups were not  statistically significant yhl was significantly higher for  women than for men in the normal and overweight groups but  the sexes had similar yhl in the underweight and obese  groups  we next present the effect size for comparing each group  to the normal bmi group the effect sizes are shown in  table   with the significance results of the associated  t tests for the differences in means of the two groups  being compared for example underweight women averaged       yhl compared to      for normal women and the common  standard deviation was      the effect size is thus                    the two groups had significantly  different yhl implying that the effect size is also  significantly greater than zero a clinical trial of a  treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight  presumably by addressing the underlying cause could be  expected to have    power with n  about    women per treatment arm if   year yhl were the  outcome measure  the biggest effect sizes are in the first row comparing  underweight to normal yhl and yol have similar effect  sizes for women and are significantly different from zero  the effect sizes are not significantly different from zero  for men in part because there were only    men in the  underweight category the effect size comparing overweight  to normal yielded small non significant effect sizes with  inconsistent signs suggesting extremely large sample sizes  would be needed for comparing obese to normal only yhl  for women showed a large and significant effect size thus  an intervention to improve the health of underweight women  to that of their normal weight peers could be performed  using either yhl or yol as the outcome variable trials to  make obese women comparable to normal women could be  evaluated using yhl but not yol trials to improve the  health of the other groups to that of the normals would  probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being  overweight for men or women or obese for men affects  yol or yhl  as mentioned above we repeated these analyses excluding  the persons with partially estimated data and using two  different ways of coding yhl the only substantive change  was that some of the differences between blacks and whites  shown in table  were no longer statistically significant  due to a smaller sample size  discussion  optimal weight and overweight  recent studies have defined obesity without reference  to age         andres  et al proposed a desirable bmi of        for persons aged    to      allison  et al    proposed       for  older men and       for older women in figure   the  overweight as opposed to the obese are no different  from those of normal weight suggesting that these two  categories could be combined for older adults since  future improvements in life expectancy may be limited     the greatest advances may be made by improving  people s yhl this suggests that the development of  future guidelines should take yhl or other measures of  quality of life into account  implications for clinical trials  based on these findings trials to address obesity in  older women could be efficient if yhl but not yol was  the outcome measure that is women who changed from  being obese to being normal would likely show changes in  yhl but not yol clinical trials of weight modification  interventions for older adults who were merely overweight  would appear to be fruitless since the interventions  would probably not have a direct effect on either yol or  yhl  weight or weight change are sometimes used as the  outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or  exercise programs the fact that weight is not associated  in a consistent way with health suggests that such  evaluations should be considered critically when older  adults are the subjects this is particularly important  in the light of recent findings which found that  interventions such as weight loss drugs may be harmful        for older adults the risks associated with  higher weight are especially unclear and the optimal  outcome for a trial of weight loss in older adults  requires specific attention to improved health and  mortality  interestingly the strongest health relationships were  found for underweight older adults clinical trials whose  objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their  normal weight peers presumably by addressing the  underlying conditions that caused the low weight could  be performed efficiently using either yol or yhl as the  outcome measure both yol and yhl would be clinically  significant in this patient group  potential limitations  chs participants were somewhat healthier than the  average older adult however adjustment for detailed  covariates made little difference in the findings we  estimated the last four years of health data for about     of the sample but results with and without this  group were similar analysis of mean yol instead of the  more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was  appropriate here since virtually no persons were lost to  follow up biases caused by over adjustment are probably  not large since the findings were not sensitive to the  number of variables adjusted for  these results are for a   year follow up the relative  superiority of yhl to yol would probably hold in trials  with shorter follow up the effect sizes in table  might  also be appropriate in shorter trials since lengthy  trials often add little information  evgfp on which yhl was based might have missed some  effects of obesity on risk factors for future health a  person who is depressed because of a poor self image  related to obesity or who has osteo arthritis related to  obesity and limits to activities to successfully avoid  pain would surely have worse evgfp than others based on  results from many studies however health measures  designed specifically to measure those conditions might  be more sensitive to change in weight than evgfp if yhl  were based on such measures the superiority of yhl to  yol would likely be even greater than that shown here  these more sensitive measures might also have detected  differences between the overweight and normal weight  persons but we think this is unlikely given the absence  of any differences in evgfp  conclusion  recommendations for desirable weight have been  criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health we  found associations between yhl and obesity that were not  present in the mortality analysis suggesting that yhl may  be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in  older adults especially for women future efforts to  determine desirable weight guidelines should include  measures of yhl using either yol or yhl however we found  no excess risk for older adults who would be classified as  overweight by the nhlbi guidelines this suggests using  yhl as the outcome measure in clinical trials involving  obese or underweight older adults and discouraging trials  that address older adults who are merely overweight  competing interests  none declared  abbreviations  bmi body mass index  cesd center for epidemiologic studies

  background  ecto nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases  e ntpdases formerly called ecto atpases hydrolyze  nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations and are  insensitive to inhibitors of p type f type and v type  atpases   three isoforms that differ in the ratio of  atpase adpase activity are present on the cell surface  e ntpdase  with a ratio of   e ntpdase  with a ratio  of    and e ntpdase  with a ratio of     ntpdases are  important in many physiological processes like cell  motility adhesion nonsynaptic information transfer  secretion regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases  understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the ntpdases will  help description of their physiological functions and  development of strategies to regulate the functions of the  enzymes  the catalytic mechanism of ntpdases is not known even  though some basic facts of the catalysis have been  established ntpdases do not form phosphorylated  intermediates during catalysis a conclusion also supported  by lack of vanadate sensitivity and pi product inhibition          the catalytic reaction appears to be  irreversible and no partial reactions have been observed      divalent cations like ca   or mg   are required for  activity and maximal activity is reached when the  concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal    the specific activities of ntpdases vary over a  broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to  less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ecto atpase       sequence comparisons indicate that most of  ntpdases contain five highly conserved regions apyrase  conserved region acr  acr       however the  catalytic sites have not been identified although acr  and  acr  have been implicated in β and γ phosphate binding  respectively  e ntpdase  is also called cd   as it was first  described as an antigen present on activated b and t  lymphocytes residues of acr  to acr  of cd   have been  mutated to study the involvement of the acr regions in  catalysis e    in acr  and s    in acr  are required for  catalytic function    substitution of h   in acr  converted cd   into an adpase in a quaternary structure  dependent manner    mutation of w   a in acr  affected cd   folding and translocation while mutation of  w   a in acr  increased atpase activity but diminished  adpase activity    mutations of d   and g   of acr  and d    and g    of acr  demonstrated that the nucleotide  phosphate binding domains of ntpdases are similar to those  present in the actin heat shock protein sugar kinase  superfamily    these results suggest that the  conserved residues of the acr  to   regions are involved in  the catalytic mechanism of cd  the catalytic activity of cd   is dependent on the  presence of divalent cations since the interactions of ca   and mg  with proteins are difficult to study due to the  lack of spectroscopic properties vanadyl v iv o   has  been used as a probe of the ligands that compose mg   ca    and mn   binding sites of several proteins including  carboxypeptidase    s adenosylmethionine synthetase        pyruvate kinase       and f    atpase       this cation  specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of  several enzymes and in many cases serves as a functional  cofactor    vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial  coordination sites relative to the axis of the  double bounded oxygen an arrangement that is similar to  that for ca   and mg   as it is known that the  a and  g tensors derived from the epr spectrum  of bound vo   are a direct measure of the nature of the  equatorial metal ligands    binding of vo   to cd  could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of  cd  recently we reported that a recombinant soluble cd  capable of hydrolyzing both atp and adp was expressed and  purified from insect cells    only one  nucleotide binding site was identified on the purified  soluble cd   in the presence of ca   when non hydrolysable  nucleotide analogs were used in this report we  characterized the signals that were obtained from bound vo    when atp or adp was present at the catalytic site of the  purified soluble cd   the possible metal ligands for vo   at the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic  mechanism is discussed  results  nucleotidase activity of purified soluble cd   with  vo   as cofactor  the ability of purified soluble cd   to hydrolyze vo    atp is shown in figure   soluble cd   did not  hydrolyze either atp or adp in the absence of vo   fig   a when vo   was mixed with atp at a ratio of     the  concentrations of both adp and amp increased and atp  decreased as the incubation time was prolonged fig  b  the atpase activity of scd   with vo   was about    of  that with ca   as a cofactor vanadyl is unstable in  aqueous solution at ph    in the absence of chelator and  will precipitate out of solution as vo oh  n the rate of precipitation depends  on the abundance and affinity of the chelator this means  that the actual vo   concentration was lower than     mm  this result indicates that vo   can functionally  substitute for ca   as cofactor for scd   nucleotidase  activity  characterization of bound vo   adpnp by  cw epr  the parallel features of cw epr spectrum of bound vo    in the presence of adpnp an atp analog are shown in  figure  a this spectrum shows   v hyperfine splitting  and the center of the parallel transitions from molecules  with the v o bond oriented along the magnetic field a  g  which are strong enough to tell  the nature of vo   equatorial ligands    of the  eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented  molecules the  and  transitions shown in the figures  from left to right respectively do not overlap with  perpendicular transitions the   v hyperfine splitting  spectra from molecules with v o bond perpendicular to the  magnetic field a⊥ are much smaller and not shown here     the intensity of  peak is used as direct measurement  of the amount of bound vo   since this peak is the most  intense peak in the epr spectrum that contains  contribution only from a  but not a⊥       in this  study the intensities of each bound vo   epr feature  were normalized to   mg of protein  vo   bound as the vo   amppnp complex to scd  produced a strong spectrum characterized by a  of        mhz and g  of        fig  b called species  t table   the best fit of epr species t to eq   is one  equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three  equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate  groups table   this result is consistent with amppnp  binding strongly to a single site on scd   in the  presence of metal  characterization of epr species from vo   ampcp  bound to scd  figure  ashows the parallel features of the epr  spectrum of scd   bound vo   ampcp two sets of parallel  transitions were observed and the derived a  and g  values are listed in table   one  set had a  of        mhz and g  of       which is defined as  species d  fig  b the other set displayed a  of        mhz and g  of        which is called species  d  fig  c the intensity of species d  accounted for       of species t from bound vo   amppnp and the  intensity of d  accounted for     of species t the  intensity ratio of species d  over d  was  in order to distinguish species d  from d  the sample  with vo   ampcp bound to scd   was thawed and incubated  at room temperature for    minutes and the vo   epr  spectrum was collected again as shown in figure  aand   b either a  or g  values for both species d  and d  were changed the intensity of species d  was not changed  as it accounted for      of the intensity of species t  of the bound vo   amppnp however the intensity of  species d  was decreased dramatically and it accounted  for only     of the intensity of species t the  intensity ratio of d  over d  increased about    fold to  become  there are two sets of equatorial ligands that can fit  well the epr species d  according to eq   table   one  set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water  molecules one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or  phosphate and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino  group the other set contains one equatorial oxygen from  water and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups  or phosphate the best fit for the epr species d  to eq  is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three  equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate  epr characteristics of scd   bound vo   atp  in order to capture the bound vo   epr signal before  the enzyme completely turned over scd   and vo   atp  were mixed on ice immediately transferred into the epr  tube and frozen the entire process took about  seconds the parallel portion of the collected vo   epr  spectrum is shown in figure  a vo   atp complex bound  to scd   produced an epr spectrum with a  of       mhz and g  of        which corresponded to  species d  fig  b the signal intensity from the bound  vo   nucleotide complex accounted only for     of that  of species t from bound non hydrolysable vo   adpnp  complex  the same sample made from mixing vo   atp and scd  was incubated at room temperature for    minutes then  the vo   epr spectrum was generated as shown in figures   cand  d the epr parameters derived from this vo   epr  spectrum were       mhz for a  and        for g  respectively which is consistent  with species d  however the signal intensity decreased  about      fold compared to that obtained before room  temperature incubation  free vo   binding to scd   characterized by  cd epr  like other metals ca   and mg   free vo    inhibited the nucleotidase activities of scd   at high  concentration data not shown vo   in the absence of  any nucleotides was added to scd   at     molar ratio  the parallel transitions of bound vo   epr spectrum are  shown in figure   the features derived from the vo    epr spectrum were     mhz for a  and       for g  which was designed as species v  fig  b the signal intensity of bound vo   accounted  for      of that from the bound vo   adpnp complex  the best fit of equatorial ligands for species v  according to eq   is two equatorial oxygen from hydroxyl  groups and another two equatorial oxygen from two water  molecules  discussion  vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups  that serve as metal ligands in f    atpase and other enzymes     because the g and a tensors of the   v hyperfine  couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors  from each type of group that contributes an equatorial  ligand       by studying the epr spectra of bound vo    in the presence of different nucleotides we show that  the interaction of soluble cd   with atp is different from  that with adp  it is not surprising that vo   can functionally replace  ca   in the hydrolysis of both atp and adp by soluble cd  although the enzymatic activity is about    of that with  ca   as the cofactor since f    atpase also hydrolyzes atp at a  decreased rate when vo   replaces mg  the epr features of vo   are able to reveal some details  about how cd   hydrolyzes atp and adp a single epr  feature species t was observed when adpnp a  non hydrolyzable analog of atp complexed with vo   was  bound to scd   which is consistent with the presence of  only one nucleotide binding site    the g and a  tensors derived from species t are        and        mhz  respectively which can be fitted best with one amino group  and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate  groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound vo   on  scd   in accordance with metal atp complex coordination on  other enzymes that hydrolyze atp like f    atpase       the γ and  β phosphate of atp most likely bind to vo   while the third  carboxyl group is contributed by a side chain of aspartate  or glutamate of scd   it is not unusual for the ε amino  group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes it  has been reported that the amino group serves as one of vo    equatorial ligands in cf    atpase    pyruvate kinase     adomet synthetase       and carboxypeptidase     thus one amino group from lysine one carboxyl group  from aspartate or glutamate and two oxygens from the  phosphates of adpnp serve as the equatorial ligands of  scd   bound vo   in the presence of adpnp  in the presence of ampcp bound vo   produced two epr  features species d  and species d  that are separated by  about    mhz as we have reported that scd   releases  intermediate adp before adp is further cleaved during atp  hydrolysis    scd   probably has two conformations  that bind metal adp complexes one is the conformation that  releases the adp intermediate and another that recruits  intermediate adp back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis  to amp however intact cd   does not release intermediate  adp during atp hydrolysis suggesting that there is only  one adp binding site on each cd   monomer in the intact  protein      the two epr species observed with vo    ampcp probably correspond to the two different  conformations of bound adp at the same catalytic site on  scd   the signal intensity of the bound vo   ampcp epr  spectrum indicates that species d  is dominant over species  d  in order to further assign species d  and d  to the two  different conformations two experiments were done fig    incubation of scd   with vo   ampcp at room  temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the  intensity of species d  while the signal intensity of  species d  remained unchanged these data indicate that vo    ampcp was released from the conformation corresponding  to species d  however the conformation corresponding to  species d  still had bound vo   ampcp more evidence for  two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the epr  spectra of bound vo   atp no species t was found  presumably because atp was converted to adp before the  sample was frozen only species d  was observed and its  intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged  we suggest that species d  corresponds to the conformation  that releases adp as an intermediate product and species d  corresponds to the conformation that binds adp as a  substrate the lower signal intensities of species d  and  d  compared to that of species t suggest that the affinity  of scd   for adp or its analog ampcp is lower than that for  the atp analog adpnp which is consistent with the result  that only atp analogs were detected on scd  the calculated g  and a  values that best matched the  experimental values for species d  suggest that one  hydroxyl group and three oxygens derived from carboxyl  groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound  vo   adp since the conformation corresponding to species  d  is found in the presence of atp and is likely to be the  conformation that releases bound vo   adp it is likely  that the vo  ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl  groups    when adp is the substrate and generates  species d  one water molecule and a combination of three  groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the  equatorial ligands of bound vo   on scd   the probable  combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species  d  is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since vo    complexes adp through two phosphates before vo   adp is  bound to the enzyme  the site directed mutagenesis studies on cd   and other  members of the cd   family give some hints about the  possible residues that serve as metal ligands at the  catalytic site of scd   the changes of d   on acr  e  on acr  d    d    in hb  and s    on acr  dramatically  decrease both atpase and adpase activities of cd  figure  summarizes the possible coordination of ca    from the data of species t species d  and species d  in  the different situations of scd   catalysis the catalytic  base attack results in cleavage of the γ phosphate of atp  and one carboxyl group replaces the γ phosphate as a metal  ligand from species t to species d  which is accompanied  by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group s  this hydroxyl group s    probably interacts with the  water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation  corresponding to species d  to hydrolyze adp the constant  carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of scd  hydrolysis is likely contributed by d    since it is close  to s  the results presented here also provide an explanation  to the free metal inhibition of cd   catalytic activity  free vo   binds to scd   through two hydroxyl groups and  two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other  residues of scd   once free vo   occupies the catalytic  site the enzyme has to either release the metal or correct  the conformation before the substrates are recruited  properly  conclusions  vo   can functionally substitute for ca   as a cofactor  for scd   four different epr spectra are obtained for vo    bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the  absence of nucleotide the protein ligands for vo  in the  presence of atp are suggested to be carboxyl and amino  groups while those in the presence of adp are probably  carboxyl and hydroxyl groups the mechanism of scd  catalysis is discussed these results will provide guides  for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of  ntpdases  materials and methods  reagents  atp adp adpnp ampcp were

  background  glutamate decarboxylase gad catalyzes the formation of  the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ amino butyric acid gaba  from glutamate in mammals the two isoforms of this  enzyme gad   and gad   are expressed from two separate  genes  gad  and  gad  respectively       gaba  signaling plays several roles in neuronal development  early in cns development gaba can modulate neuron  progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration  survival and differentiation           in some classes of neural progenitors gaba  stimulates these processes while in others it has an  antagonistic activity for example recent work has  demonstrated that gaba acts in the developing neocortex to  stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the  ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of  progenitors in the subventricular zone    later during  postnatal development normal gabaergic input is required  for activity dependent plasticity in the visual cortex as  shown in the  gad  knockout mouse       in  addition to these functions in the developing cns gaba  signaling is also required for the normal development of  non neural tissues targeted mutations of the  gad  gene lead to defective  development of the secondary palate       the cleft  palate phenotype of the  gad  mutants suggests the involvement  of gaba mediated signals in the normal development and  differentiation of a structure derived from the oral  epithelium and neural crest ecto mesenchyme this  conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate  defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in  the β  subunit of the gaba  a receptor  this intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for  gaba mediated signaling in the development of a non neural  structure the secondary palate the potential for this  pathway to be involved in the early development of  additional non neural tissues has not yet been thoroughly  explored    to address this question we surveyed  gad  transcript distribution in the  non cns tissues of the embryo using a whole mount  in situ hybridization approach we  found that  gad  is indeed expressed in a number  of different regions and tissues a notable feature of this  expression pattern is that  gad  transcripts accumulate in the  specialized ectodermal structures that are involved in the  formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth  these specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be  sources of developmental signals          in  addition transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem  cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal  endoderm and mesenchyme the expression patterns show that  gad  is expressed in several non cns  structures that are derived from each of the three germ  layers of the embryo  results  the mouse  gad  gene is widely expressed in the  embryonic central nervous system    to define  additional sites of expression outside of the cns we  analyzed the distribution of  gad  transcripts in e    to e  mouse embryos by whole mount  in situ hybridization  gad  transcripts were not detected in  e    day embryos data not shown at e  gad  was readily detected in the  tailbud figure  a expression in the tail continued  through e     and was undetectable by e     figure   b c dand data not shown a period corresponding to  secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo  examination of sections from an e    embryo revealed a high  level of  gad  expression throughout the  mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of  the tailbud figure  f no transcripts were detected in  the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme  figure  f at more cranial levels within the tail  expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm ventral  neural tube notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut  figure  e in the paraxial mesoderm the highest  expression levels were also localized ventrally adjacent  to the notochord figure  e  in the pharyngeal region of e    embryos  gad  rna was detected in and around  the second third and fourth pharyngeal pouches figure   a sections through the third pouch confirmed the  presence of  gad  expression in the pouch endoderm  data not shown expression was particularly strong in the  dorsal portion of this pouch figure  b the additional  diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal  mesenchyme figure  b the expression in the pharyngeal  region was very transient transcripts were easily detected  at e    but only faintly at e    and were not detectable  by e  in the limb buds  gad  rna was detected from e    to  e     figure  a b c d e f g h transcripts were initially  expressed in the pre apical ectodermal ridge pre aer at  e    figure  a b and by e     were seen in the definitive  aer of the forelimb figure  d at e  gad  was expressed in a diffuse  stripe in the forelimb figure  d while in the hindlimb  expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm figure   e by e     forelimb aer expression was fading and  expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal  forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb  figure  g h the earlier activation of  gad  in the forelimb reflects the  normal temporal order of events in limb development  sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds  was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme data not  shown  gad  rna was not detected in the  limbs by whole mount  in situ hybridization after  e  a dynamic pattern of  gad  expression was detected in the  developing vibrissae from e     to e     figure   a b c d e f g h expression was first detected in the  supra orbital infra orbital and post oral vibrissae and  in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and  maxillary rows figure  a b nomenclature as in  gad  rna was also detected in some of  the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage expression  was activated in a posterior to anterior towards the nose  progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows  reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development    by  e  gad  expression was detected in the  anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated  in the rhinal labial and submental vibrissae figure   c d by e     expression was strong in the labial  submental and rhinal vibrissae figure  e f sections of  e     whole mounts show that  gad  expression was localized to the  epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae figure  g h  and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate  figure  g  control hybridizations using a sense strand  gad  probe were also performed  embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any  staining pattern at any of the stages tested e    e  sense strand hybridization results for e     and e  embryos are shown in figure  discussion  the expression results reported here show that  gad  was activated in several tissues  outside of the central nervous system during mouse  development transcripts were not seen at e    and were  first detected at e    it was surprising that this very  early phase of  gad  expression was largely outside  of the developing cns and was localized in the tail bud  mesenchyme and in the pre apical ectodermal ridge pre aer  of the forelimb bud as development proceeded  gad  was detected in pharyngeal  endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae  the data demonstrate that  gad  is expressed in several sites  outside of the developing cns and in derivatives of all  three germ layers we have also detected the expression of  gad  lacz transgenes in the  developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and  surprising  in situ hybridization results we  report here j j westmoreland and b g c unpublished  results  previous studies have shown that  gad  can be regulated at the  post transcriptional and translational level  gad  mrna translation or protein  stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level  of gaba       during embryogenesis  post transcriptional regulation occurs by alternative  splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice        this alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop  codon into the  gad  mrna and can produce the  truncated proteins gad   and gad   from its   and  ends respectively the studies reported here used a probe  that will detect the adult  gad  mrna that encodes gad   as well  as the embryonic alternatively spliced mrna that can encode  gad   and gad   these additional mechanisms of  gad  regulation may control the  production of gad proteins and the synthesis of gaba in the  non neural cell types detected in our study  the whole mount  in situ hybridization data reported  here extends the results of a recently published section  in situ hybridization study on  e     e     mouse embryos    our analysis showed that  gad  expression is first detectable  earlier at e    and revealed novel non cns sites of  expression in the pharyngeal region vibrissae tail bud  and limb bud the results of the previous study  together with the data reported herein provide a  comprehensive picture of  gad  expression in the e    e  mouse embryo  previous studies have noted  gad expression outside of the cns in  adults  gad  and  gad  have been detected in a number  of tissues including kidney testis oviduct pancreatic  islets and adrenal cortex             previously  reported sites of embryonic  gad  expression outside of the brain  and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens  fibers and the olfactory pit       in e     e  mouse embryos  gad  is expressed in the olfactory  and the lens placodes the anlagen of the olfactory pit and  lens fibers    we also detected  gad  expression in these tissues  please see figure  aand data not shown expression of  gad in the developing heart and blood  vessels has also been reported    we detected weak  staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel  expression perhaps due to the very low levels of  expression in developing vasculature    our results  document localized expression of  gad  at additional non cns sites in  the mouse embryo suggesting a potential role for gaba  signaling in the development of these structures  our interest in the role of gaba signaling in developing  tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from  the cleft palate phenotype of the  gad  and the β  gaba  a receptor subunit mutants        the genetic data strongly suggest that gaba acts  through gaba  a receptors to modulate the development  of this tissue although the data reported here do not  explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype they do  indicate that  gad  is expressed in several  additional non cns tissues in the mouse embryo it is  particularly noteworthy that these include the aer of the  limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae  both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of  developmental signals required for morphogenesis and  patterning             it will be of interest to  examine the expression pattern of gaba receptors in the  mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers  expression of gaba receptor subunits in adjacent tissues  would indicate that these receptors read the developmental  signals mediated by gaba in these structures and  tissues  conclusions  the mouse gene encoding the    kda isoform of glutamate  decarboxylase  gad  is expressed in the tail bud  mesenchyme vibrissal placodes pharyngeal arches and  pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge aer mesenchyme  and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from  e    e     some of the  gad  expressing tissues vibrissal  placodes aer are known sources of developmental signals  other sites of expression correspond to stem cell  populations that give rise to multiple differentiated  tissues tail bud mesenchyme pharyngeal endoderm and  mesenchyme the localized and dynamic expression pattern  of  gad  suggests a wider role for gad  and gaba in the development of non neural tissues than was  previously known  materials and methods  whole mount  in situ hybridizations were performed  on swiss webster embryos as described

  background  primary sjögren s syndrome  °ss is a systemic  autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes  keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry mouth xerostomia as  well as involvement of other exocrine glands while  °ss is  typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy the  immune destruction can often extend to affect non exocrine  organs around    of patients with  °ss can present with  involvement of other organs such as the thyroid central  nervous system lungs kidney and liver the association of  liver disease and  °ss was suggested more than    years ago    while liver involvement in  °ss has been considered  rare   only a few clinical studies specifically  address this complication and evaluate the association of  liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of   °ss  liver diseases associated with  °ss include primary  biliary cirrhosis pbc autoimmune cholangitis  autoimmune hepatitis     viral hepatitis b and c                                   sclerosing cholangitis     and nodular regenerative hyperplasia    in  addition chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found  in patients with different types of liver cirrhosis  we report the results of a review of cases undertaken to  determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests  lfts and liver disease in patients with  °ss referred to  a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal lfts  with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of   °ss  methods  statistical analysis  the statistical analysis included descriptive measures  means standard deviations and ranges comparison of  results of patients with and without liver disease was  done using t tests of continuous variables and fisher s  exact test or x  for categoric measures  results  of the     charts reviewed    cases    women and  men median age    fulfilled eecc for  °ss and were  initially included for analysis of the    patients a  of them    patients have had a salivary gland biopsy  performed in all these patients the biopsy confirmed the  diagnosis of sjögren s syndrome all patients studied had  objective evidence of  °ss including keratoconjunctivitis  sicca positive labial salivary gland biopsy  autoantibodies and or salivary gland hypofunction we  excluded those patients without these objective criteria of   °ss and also those who did not fulfill eecc criteria  the mean age at time of onset of disease was    ±  years old and disease duration was     years ±     years  mean ± range liver function tests had been determined in     patients      and abnormal liver function tests were  found in    of the    patients      further analysis  was then undertaken in those patients in whom lfts had been  measured the clinical and laboratory characteristics of  these patients are shown in tables  and  for these ss patients studied abnormal lfts were more  common than any other potential non exocrine features of  ss clinical evidence of liver disease defined in methods  section was found in    patients      all of whom had  abnormal liver function tests two deaths occurred in the  population studied both attributed to liver failure an  additional patient required a liver transplant in all  cases the diagnosis of  °ss antedated the onset of liver  disease or its diagnosis markers of viral hepatitis  sought in    patients were found only in   two patients  carried the surface antigen of hepatitis b virus and one  had antibodies to hepatitis c virus in a liver biopsy of a  patient who lacked serological markers for hepatitis  viruses hepatitis b virus was detected by  in situ hybridization  risk factors for liver disease were identified in    of  the patients with abnormal liver function tests and are  described in table   no association with tobacco use was  found only   patients had documented evidence of tobacco  consumption we found no significant differences in risk  factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients  with or without hepatic involvement therefore in    of  the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of  liver disease no clear explanation for the abnormal lfts  was found except for the association with  °ss  the pattern of biochemical liver abnormalities was  mainly hepatocellular defined as predominant increase of  ast and or alt in comparison with ap and or bilirubins in     cases cholestatic defined as predominant increase in  ap and or bilirubins compared with ast and or alt in   and  mixed evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular  damage in   cases abnormalities were persistent present  on every occasion when measured more than once in  patients      of those with abnormal lfts intermittent  presence of lft abnormalities was not found in all  determinations in      and in one case     there was  only one determination of liver function tests the pattern  of liver enzyme abnormalities is shown in figure   none of  the patients with abnormal liver function tests had  clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain  the high levels of amino transferases activity of cpk or  aldolase was not elevated when measured in    of the  patients with abnormal liver function tests  anti mitochondrial antibodies ama and anti smooth muscle  antibodies asma were sought in   patients with positive  asma in  the association of abnormal liver function tests with  other non exocrine features of  °ss is shown in figure  patients with abnormal liver function tests were more  likely to have lung kidney or hematological  manifestations when compared to sjögren s patients without  liver disease presence of other non exocrine features of   °ss was not influenced by prevalence of liver  diseases  regarding laboratory test results patients with liver  disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation  rate at some point during the course of their disease a  positive anti ena anti ro anti ro la and or anti rnp  was also associated with an increased prevalence of  abnormal liver function tests figure   the sample was  too small to determine whether a specific ena was  associated with liver disease other markers of systemic  inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the  presence or absence of lft abnormalities  liver biopsies done in   patients disclosed post viral  chronic active hepatitis   cryptogenic cirrhosis  and one case each of post viral cirrhosis alcoholic  hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis  discussion  in this group of sjögren s patients seen at a tertiary  care center abnormal liver function tests were found to be  a common non exocrine feature of  °ss the prevalence of  this association was found to be higher in our study than  in other previous series             the true  prevalence could be even higher since liver enzyme profiles  were not done in all patients the prevalence suggested in  previous reports ranges from   to    but the definition  of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific e g  hepatomegaly to well proven cases of liver disease             denko in      reported that    of patients  with ss had hepatosplenomegaly    other studies done  in the      s also confirmed hepatomegaly in       of  patients with ss       in      whaley reported liver  disease in   of patients with ss and mentioned an  association with anti mitochondrial antibodies   in       tsianos and co workers described    ss patients with  gastrointestinal complications called from a large cohort  only two patients had liver disease each with chronic  active hepatitis   other studies have reported  variable prevalence      and different  histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from  cholestatic liver damage stage i primary biliary  cirrhosis to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis c  virus  in our study liver disease was associated with other  non exocrine manifestations of  °ss specifically those  affecting lung kidney and blood cells those patients with  serological evidence of systemic inflammation as shown by  an elevated sedimentation rate were more likely to have  liver test abnormalities also the presence of a positive  anti ena correlated positively with hepatic disease an  association of ena response with liver disease has been  described in children with autoimmune hepatitis where  anti ena positive patients demonstrated more severe liver  test abnormalities than those who were anti ena negative     in another study a    of patients with various  chronic liver diseases were found to be anti rnp positive  with etiopathogenesis of  °ss still an open question     a possible role of hepatitis c virus hcv has drawn  attention recent studies have mentioned hcv incidence in  patients with  ss ranging from  phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands  with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis c  virus infection and or  °ss has given conflicting results        some reports mention that the salivary gland  findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver  disease associated with hcv infection than in those with   °ss    while others mention distinctive differences  between both groups regarding focus score expression of  surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary  glands and in epithelial cells as well as differences in  the degree of inflammation       transgenic mice  models that carry the hcv envelope genes develop an  exocrinopathy affecting salivary and lachrymal glands  expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ  between hcv infection and  °ss positive enas are rarely  seen in hcv patients also in most cases sicca symptoms  are not present in individuals with hcv as compared with  the  °ss population although the prevalence of viral  hepatitis markers in our group of patients with liver  disease was very low and did not account for most of the  cases with abnormal liver function tests these markers  were not sought in a small percentage of these patients it  is important to note that hcv appears to account for a  subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints in which half  the cases might meet the definition for ss according to  european and manthorpe criteria however this subgroup is  characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations  observed in  °ss and the absence of anti ro and anti la  an aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and  different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a  mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in  ° ss     since it has been suggested that the target tissue  involved in the autoimmune histopathologic lesions of  °ss  might be the epithelium    it is interesting that the  findings in our study point to the association of liver  disease with pulmonary and renal abnormalities all which  are characterized by epithelial damage  epithelial cells have been proposed to be active  participants rather than passive targets in the chronic  immune response in  °ss but further studies are needed to  establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the  pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease including  the analysis of hla expression and cytokine secretion  pattern in these cells  the co existence of liver disease and the presence of  circulating amas in sjögren s patients sera has been  pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be  autoimmune and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis           in previous studies a pericholangial  lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage i  of primary biliary cirrhosis has been reported in  °ss  with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for ama      in our review of cases we found predominance in  hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic  disease which would argue against a pbc type of liver  damage other authors had proposed that ss associated with  pbc should be considered a form of secondary ss that  resembles more the sicca complex with exocrine features  seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis  limitations of the study come primarily from being a  retrospective analysis since the patients were studied in  a tertiary care referral center the severity of the  disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be  different from the general  °ss population furthermore in  many cases sjögren s syndrome diagnosis had been sought  because of otherwise unexplained non exocrine features  while we could not find an association between use of  nsaids or other medications and prevalence of liver  function tests abnormalities the study design did not  allow us to exclude the possibility of over the counter  otc medication use that could have affected lft s  measurement drug toxicity is certainly an important factor  to be considered however given that most patients had  persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of lfts  and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in  the majority of patients with liver abnormalities a toxic  effect of medications could not be established  conclusions  based on the results of this study we consider that an  evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver  disease should be done in every patient with  °ss  particularly if there is evidence of other non exocrine  complications or serological evidence of systemic  inflammation although no other diagnosis explaining liver  disease may be found the disorders for which treatment  might be beneficial e g immunosuppressants for autoimmune  hepatitis interferon alpha for viral hepatitis  ursodeoxycolic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis warrant  a diligent search in all cases of  °ss with abnormal liver  function  competing interests  none  authors contributions  both authors

  there is a much quoted saying attributed to the epidemiologist geoffrey rose “a large  number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases than a small number  exposed to a very high risk ” this is true for many individual risk factors such as salt  intake linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and speeding on the  highway linked to injuries and accidents does it apply to many other global health  risks the study by anthony rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does  to develop effective health policies one must understand the existing health risks and  disease burdens on a worldwide scale this is a tough challenge the global burden of  disease database maintained by the world health organization who collects data from  countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco malnutrition childhood abuse  unsafe sex childbirth and cholesterol levels as well as on disease burdens for example  depression blindness and diarrhea a large group of scientists from all over the world  has developed a framework to analyze these data to compare different risks or burdens  they calculate disability adjusted life years or dalys—the number of healthy life years  lost because of a particular disease or risk factor  rodgers and colleagues used data from the who database for    risk factors and from  epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of  risk factor attributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age  sex and exposure level for being underweight in childhood for example—the leading risk  factor for global loss of healthy life—they found that only    of the disease burden  occurred in severely underweight children the rest occurred in those only moderately  underweight the relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower but the  number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted  to almost two thirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor  the analysis confirms—and extends to a global level—previous research showing that many  major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels not just among  individuals exposed to high levels of risk it also points to risk factors that are  particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups and for which highly  targeted interventions could be effective  despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one such analyses are  essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life  years lost to premature death and disability 
  introduction  the concept of lung fibroblasts as effector cells in the  pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf has  recently evolved     lung fibroblasts respond  in vitro to inflammatory cytokines  by producing growth factors and collagen resulting in  fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix  deposition       in addition activated lung  fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of  inflammatory cytokines and chemokines  in vitro and hence these cells may  also have a role as effector inflammatory cells  this capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic  factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung  fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target  cells via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms perpetuating  the fibrotic process  prostanoids are important regulators of fibroblast  function           prostaglandin pg e    is thought to have antifibrotic  properties  in vitro but also can have  proinflammatory effects both  in vivo and  in vitro          thromboxane  tx a    increases proliferation and dna and  rna synthesis in several cell types including fibroblasts  and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells        conversely prostacyclin pgi    decreases smooth muscle cell  proliferation and collagen synthesis  many cell types including lung fibroblasts contain  cyclooxygenase cox a proximal enzyme in prostanoid  production and can generate prostanoids    it has  been previously reported that ipf lung fibroblasts have  decreased cox   expression compared to normal lung  fibroblasts and hence have decreased pge    production          because of  these findings and the fact that pgs are important  fibroblast regulators we sought to investigate whether  abnormalities in cox   expression could be associated with  an altered balance between profibrotic and antifibrotic  pgs we hypothesized that fibroblasts from the lungs of  patients with ipf hf ipf have an altered pg balance  compared to normal lung fibroblasts hf nl this  phenotypical abnormality could be an important factor in  the pathogenesis of ipf  materials and methods  primary lung fibroblasts  fibroblasts from the lungs of seven patients   males  with ipf hf ipf were harvested a from excised lung at  the time of lung transplantation b during an autopsy  performed within   hours from death or c during open or  transbronchial lung

two aliquots which  were used for rna and protein extractions respectively  the above experiments were repeated in hf ipf n   and  hf nl n   using serum free media conditions  prostanoids were measured by modified stable isotope  dilution assays that used gas chromatography negative  ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry as previously  described    briefly deuterium labeled internal

minimal cox   mrna in unstimulated cells and  significant upregulation of cox   mrna expression when  stimulated with il  β in both hf ipf and hf nl fig  discussion  several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and  collagen production including mitogenic cytokines e g  transforming growth factor β tgfβ platelet derived  growth factor pdgf basic fibroblast growth factor  bfgf eicosanoids i e pge    txb    and pgi    and antifibrogenic cytokines e g  ifn γ       it is very likely that a complex  interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair  process and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis as in  ipf results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts  that affect the normal interaction of these factors  our results show that stimulation of primary cultures of  human lung fibroblasts with the proximal cytokine il  β  upregulates cox   protein and mrna expression to a similar  degree in normal and ipf fibroblasts txa    production tended to be greater in ipf  than in normal fibroblasts at baseline when stimulated  with il  β this difference became statistically  significant the ratio of pgi    to txa    metabolites was lower in ipf  fibroblasts at baseline and with il  β stimulation the  above results suggest that a decreased pgi    txa    ratio could be a phenotypic alteration  present in ipf fibroblasts resulting in a loss of their  capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular  matrix production  the effects of pgs on cell proliferation and collagen  production have been widely studied in different cell types                    txa    has been studied extensively because  of its apparent role in atherosclerosis due to its  prothrombotic and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth  muscle cells       these mitogenic effects are  potentiated by growth factors             in vascular  smooth muscle cells txa    stimulates synthesis of bfgf and  increases the expression of the proto oncogenes  c fos  c myc and  egr   which are associated with  entry into the cell growth cycle    in addition txa    increases proliferation of fibroblasts     and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells  on the other hand pgi    decreases vascular smooth muscle cell  proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane  synthesis via activation of adenylyl cyclase and  subsequent production of camp    betaprost an analog  of pgi    decreases procollagen i and iii mrna  expression in cardiac fibroblasts    these effects  may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with txa    and it is possible that an alteration  of a normal physiologic balance between pgi    and txa    could increase tendency towards  fibrogenesis  it is important to mention that our experiments were  conducted at similar passage levels passage   to   in  both groups since senescence of fibroblasts is associated  with a shift from the biosynthesis of pgi    to txa          it is possible that the  difference seen in our study between hf ipf and hf nl could  result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages hf ipf  might have been harvested from fibrotic lesions where  fibroblasts had previously undergone a greater number of  cell divisions than hf nl obtained from nonfibrotic lungs  although this is a possibility the age related shift in pg  production has only been shown at very high cell passages  and has not been documented  in vivo  we also found that both hf ipf and hf nl had similar pge    production at baseline and a similar  increase when stimulated with il  β pge    can decrease fibroblast proliferation  and collagen synthesis and increase collagen degradation  recent reports suggesting decreased cox   expression and  pge    production in ipf fibroblasts have  received significant attention          in our study  we found that both cox   protein expression and pge    production were upregulated to a  similar degree in ipf and normal lung fibroblasts we  believe that differences in methodology and patient  selection may explain the discrepancies with other studies  vancheri and collaborators    found that  tnf α stimulated fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased  cox   expression and pge    production but they further showed  that these findings were a result of decreased expression  of tnf α receptors the latter finding would argue against  a primary defect in cox   expression since no other  stimulus other than tnf α was tested in another study  keerthisingam  et al    reported that fibrotic  lung fibroblasts had decreased cox   expression and pge    production in response to tgfβ  stimulation this study differed from ours in that a  different stimulus was used of significance is the fact  that the cox   gene is known to be nf κb dependent and  il  β but not tgfβ is a potent inducer of nf κb  activation hence the pathway involved in the induction of  the cox   gene by il  β and tgfβ may be different  furthermore a significant proportion of the fibroblasts  used in the study by keerthisingam  et al    were obtained from  patients with systemic sclerosis which makes their  fibroblast population more heterogeneous  wilborn  et al    also reported a  decreased production of pge    by il  β stimulated ipf fibroblasts  due to decreased cox   expression    there is a  possibility that patient selection may have differed  between the two studies however we feel certain that the  diagnostic accuracy of our patient population was high due  to the fact that   out of a total of   ipf subjects  included in our study underwent lung transplantation with  confirmatory pathology results consistent with ipf the  other   subjects had biopsy proven ipf in addition our  results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts  obtained from   subjects with advanced stage ipf with those  of   subjects at an earlier stage of their disease who had  received no therapy although the reasons for our different  results are unclear the fact that we found similar cox  expression and pge    production in normal and ipf lung  fibroblasts suggests that loss of cox   expression is not a  universal characteristic of fibroblasts cultured from the  lungs of subjects with ipf  conclusion  we have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and  ipf human lungs have a significant and similar induction of  the cox   enzyme when stimulated with il  β but that ipf  fibroblasts produced more thromboxane and had a  significantly lower prostacyclin thromboxane ratio we  hypothesize that the lower pgi    txa    ratio seen in hf ipf may be a  phenotypic alteration that plays a role in the pathogenesis  of ipf  abbreviations  cox cyclooxygenase hf human fibroblasts nl  normal lungs ipf idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ifn  interferon il interleukin pg

is now  iran to explore their surroundings they eventually reached the  islands and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part  of the aegean sea an important early material obsidian was  discovered on the island of milos obsidian is a hard vitreous  volcanic rock which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and  stabbing the high quality of the seam on milos ensured that the area  remained popular with early travelers  the basic elements of life in the aegean began to come  together as early as      b c and were already in place by the late  bronze age c      b c the major changes were not to daily tasks  and routines but to the political power base which changed regularly  and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages  cycladic culture  at around      b c a sophisticated culture evolved in the  cyclades islands the distinctive sculpted marble figures of the era  are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs you will find  original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the  cyclades although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on  paros the people farmed and fished on the dawning of the bronze age  in      b c they began to work with metals the cycladic culture was  influenced by societies in the east importing the pottery wheel from  mesopotamia they also continued to trade in obsidian and the local  marble  the minoans and the myceneans  farther south in crete the minoan culture developed after       b c into the most significant of its age spreading its influence  throughout the region by trade and diplomacy santorini thira the  next major island north was heavily influenced by crete and the  settlements of thira and akrotiri thrived at this time the magnificent  frescoes and mosaics found at akrotiri are in athens at present but  the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the  sophistication of the culture here  around      b c a massive volcanic eruption at santorini  destroyed not only akrotiri — under feet of ash and pumice — but the  whole minoan civilization massive tidal waves swept over crete and  other parts of the mediterranean smashing buildings and drowning many  thousands of people  in the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval the aegean  islands next came under the influence of the mycenaeans at around  b c who had a base in the peloponnese region of the greek mainland  the mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer not to  trade their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by  homer in his epic poems the odyssey and the iliad  the rise of athens  the dorians who came overland from northern europe  conquered the mycenaeans they were a barbaric race and their custody  of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word  was forgotten and art disappeared they held sway over islands off the  northern greek coast but the phoenicians kept control of the main sea  routes south of the area trade continued as usual at the same time  city states began to grow in influence on the southern greek mainland  athens became the most powerful heralding the start of the classical  greek period however greece was not yet a country each city state  was self governing and autonomous  the new culture spread throughout the mediterranean helped  by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements  such as carthage a greek city on the african coast of the  mediterranean culture and the arts flourished once again athletic  prowess was admired and the olympic games were constituted in     b c  to promote friendly competition homer wrote his epic works on chios  and lyrical poetry was much admired particularly the work of the poets  archilochos on paros and sappho on lesvos  the preeminent islands of this era were delos a sacred  island and center of religion ruled by athens samos ruled by the  tyrant polycrates and naxos whose ruler lygdamis undertook some major  building projects archaeology shows that during this time societies  lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement  inland  the persian wars  as athens rose in influence and power in the west it was  matched in the east by the rise of the persian empire from a power  base in anatolia the persians overran the eastern aegean islands and  set their sights on the cyclades in     b c they captured sacred  delos and razed the settlements on naxos the island communities were  undecided about which side to back for a time paros and andros  contributed to the persian armory while others supported athens the  two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of marathon and  salamis in     b c the persians were defeated and athens duly  punished the islands that had turned against it  following its victory athens introduced the concept of a  mutual protection alliance a kind of nato of the ancient world  several islands and greek city states agreed to work together and  created a treasury to fund their plans which was held on the island of  delos the alliance became known as the delian league although there  were minor internal wrangles the league controlled the aegean and the  greater athenian empire for most of the fifth century b c later in      b c the treasury was transferred to athens and its deposits were  used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and  temples of the classical age  in     b c athens began a war with its neighbor and  league member sparta although the islands saw little action as the  war went on they could see that athens was slowly losing its power  before the end of the war in     b c many islands had already  transferred their allegiance to the victors who were led by philip ii  of macedon he was followed in     b c by his son alexander the great  one of the most remarkable leaders in history his rise to power  ushered in the hellenistic period  hellenistic and roman periods  when alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east  as india the aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes  delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire following  alexander’s death his lands were divided among his generals much of  the aegean came under the rule of the ptolemies along with egypt  cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan  although in    b c mithradates made a swift and  successful raid from the east across asia minor and the aegean islands  the next major power change brought influence from the west the greek  hellenistic empire was gradually and peacefully absorbed into the  roman empire  the byzantine empire and the coming of christianity  the romans ruled a pagan empire but the aegean had an  important influence on the early development of christianity in a d       st john arrived on patmos a small rocky island in the dodecanese  as a political prisoner it was here that he wrote what was to become  the final book of the new testament the book of revelation it wasn’t  until a d     however when the newly converted emperor constantine  made byzantium renamed constantinople capital of his eastern empire  that christianity was assured of its dominant role in future greek  life  the byzantine empire had powerful and well fortified  cities but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by  waves of invaders in an attempt to counter a threat from the saracen  muslims a new potent religious force from the east the byzantine army  forcefully enlisted the men of the islands disease took a further  toll by the time of the crusades many of the aegean islands had been  practically depopulated  as the byzantine empire weakened at the end of the first  millennium crusader forces were sent from western europe to counter  the muslim forces and retake jerusalem for the christian faith  unfortunately their zeal was not matched by their discrimination the  crusaders swept through the l and of byzantium slaughtering christians  as well as muslims civilians as well as soldiers constantinople was  taken by crusader forces in      and they stripped the city of manyof  its finest treasures — which now grace the public buildings of  venice — although a large consignment of books and manuscripts was  transferred to the monastery at patmos before the city fell  while byzantine land was being divided there was no one in  control of the seas so pirates raided towns on many of the islands to  counter this the populations moved from their homes on the coast and  built settlements inland out of sight of the raiding parties this  created a pattern seen today throughout the aegean of a small port  skala which serves an inland settlement or chora making it easier to  protect the island from attack  the minor aegean islands were taken by various powerful  european noblemen many of whom were genoese or venetian such as marco  sanudo on naxos the noblemen had free rein to create their own  fiefdoms the venetians fortified their main towns — naxos town and  antiparos town are wonderful examples of this — creating labyrinths of  narrow alleys and cul de sacs that were designed to confuse and to  demoralize invaders the genoese took control of the eastern aegean  islands which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and  trade  after a final bloody defeat by the muslims in  christian forces were forced from the holy land the knights of st  john a holy military force made their way to rhodes and kos in the  dodecanese they began the process of building their strong citadels  and reinforcing the christian faith on the islands however they had  not seen the last of their muslim foe a force was gaining strength in  the east to threaten their new bases  the coming of the ottoman turks  the ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east  taking land in what is now turkey by the end of the   th century they  began their first raids on the aegean islands in      they took  constantinople and immediately made it their capital renaming it  istanbul  they then set their sights on the islands of the knights of  st john and after an unsuccessful siege in      they finally ejected  the knights from the dodecanese in      in      they wrested chios  from the genoese bolstering their hold on the eastern aegean islands  but the cyclades remained in venetian hands for another generation or  more — tinos was the last to fall in      the ottomans brought new  influences to the islands that they controlled forming a large empire  that stretched around the eastern mediterranean  toward greek independence  however a movement was growing on the greek peninsula  against ottoman rule and for an independent greek state in  russia came to aid the greeks defined by their orthodox religion  rather than by historical geographical boundaries declaring war on  the ottoman empire and occupying several aegean islands until  graffiti written by russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of  antiparos  although this attempt was unsuccessful the campaign for a  greek state continued into the   th century and began to grow in  strength the aegean islands played their part lesvos chios and  samos lay in the important shipping lanes and patriots began  disrupting ottoman cargo traffic in return the turks violently put  down every insurrection including the massacre on chios when  people were slaughtered  the ottoman empire was weakening however and in      the  peoples of the greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time  the cyclades and the sporades island chains were also included in this  new state a new sense of identity enveloped greek peoples throughout  the aegean thus commencing a movement to expand greece and unify the  disparate orthodox populations  the twentieth century  a series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the    th century began to sound a death knell for the ottoman empire the  turks lost a short war with italy and were forced to relinquish the  dodecanese islands to the italians greece took this opportunity to  absorb the islands of the northern and eastern aegean and to add  macedonia to its mainland territories  following this debacle the ottomans then allied themselves  to germany in the world war i losing more territory with the defeat of  the germans in that war greece was handed a strip of land along the  western coast of asia minor which for over       years had had a  substantial greek population greece moved in to administer the land  but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part  of greater greece  in      turkey broke away from the tired ottoman rulers  and kemal ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support he  promised a modern state for his people but as the situation became  volatile civil strife broke out in turkish cities and those  considered greek were victims of threats and violence many had to  leave their birthplaces fleeing to lesvos chios and samos the  greek ruled islands just offshore thousands of people arrived with  little more than the clothes they wore putting great strain on the  resources of the islands finally greece was ousted from its new  territory in asia minor which became part of the new turkish  state  greece attempted to stay out of world war ii but mussolini  saw greece as an ideal addition to his italian empire his forces made  a series of attacks from their bases in the dodecanese islands  including sinking a greek naval vessel in the harbor of tinos town but  they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population  against them later the germans came in force and occupied many of the  islands  after the war in      the dodecanese islands finally  became part of the greek nation but the country was politically  fragmented with arguments between monarchists and republicans right  and left and tension escalated into civil war the struggle bypassed  most of the islands although there was fierce fighting on samos even  after the fighting stopped more than a decade later the country was  not stable  at the same time the massive growth in air and road  transport saw shipping decline in importance the aegean islands which  for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes became  the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of  several islands came close to collapse  in      the military took the reins of power in athens  and until      the “colonels” held sway with a repressive and brutal  regime many greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty  and terror and many made new homes in the united states and australia  the expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism and greece  along with the aegean islands became exciting destinations for northern  europeans escaping their damp cool summers  in      greece joined the european common market now the  european union since this time membership has been of great monetary  benefit to the country the eu has given large subsidies to develop  greece’s infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient  monuments  airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands  and road systems have been expanded and im proved private investment  has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible  politically the     s have been relatively quite times for  the islands although the divorce of greek prime minister andreas  papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused  consternation within conservative greek society  as the balkans flared to war once again greek nationalism  has stirred and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the  land of macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers whether  this will ever happen remains to be seen but perhaps the aid offered  by greece to turkey after     ’s devastating earthquake is a sign that  the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to  diminish 
  a brief history  jerusalem’s recorded history begins with its mention in  egyptian court records       years ago but there had been human  settlements here for centuries probably millennia before that at the  beginning of the second millennium b c jerusalem was a canaanite  mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route far less important than  biblical cities such as hazor megiddo beth shean and shechem the  earliest name associated with the city ur usalim perhaps meant “city  of shalim” or “founded by shalim ” scholars speculate that shalim  might have been an ancient semitic deity of peace for the name  resembles the modern hebrew and arabic words for “peace” shalom and  salaam respectively if true this is an ironic name for a city that  would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places  on the face of the earth  biblical jerusalem  in the bible genesis      –   records that abraham visited  the city of “salem” in approximately      b c and was blessed by the  city’s ruler melchzedik who offered him bread and wine the city is  not mentioned again in the bible until the time of the great poet  warrior king david who captured the city from the jebusites in about       b c the bible describes how david’s soldiers conquered jerusalem  by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the  city by surprise warren’s shaft part of a canaanite water system  discovered by   th century archaeologists and open to visitors might  be the very tunnel infiltrated by david’s army  perhaps because jerusalem was in neutral territory not  allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of israel david made it the  capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented  artisans dedicated priests magical poets and musicians and the most  formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city he  also brought the ark of the covenant the portable tabernacle  containing the tablets of the law received on mount sinai to the  spring of gihon just outside the walls of jerusalem there the ark  rested until it was placed in the temple built in approximately  b c on mt moriah the high point at the northern end of the city  the temple today known as the “first” temple was completed  by david’s son and successor king solomon according to biblical  tradition although david bought the land for the temple and carefully  assembled its building materials he was deemed unworthy of  constructing the temple because he was a man of war with blood on his  hands at the temple’s dedication solomon addressed his god “ the  heavens even the heaven of the heavens cannot contain thee how much  less this house that i have built ”  the site of the temple eventually became identified as mt  moriah on which it stood where abraham was called to sacrifice his  son isaac along with this splendid house of worship solomon built a  royal palace mansions for his wives temples for the foreign gods  worshipped by the princesses he had married and towers for the defense  of the capital under the wise reign of solomon the city flourished as  the capital of an empire that stretched from damascus to the red sea  and controlled the trade routes from egypt to phoenicia the temple and  royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from africa and with  cedar from lebanon the beauties and glories of jerusalem under solomon  have captivated readers of the bible for almost       years but with  his death the empire collapsed and the israelite kingdom was divided  into two separate impoverished often warring nations israel with  its capital at shechem in the north ruled by a series of northern  dynasties and the smaller kingdom of judah with its capital at  jerusalem from which the davidic dynasty continued to rule the bible  tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms  aroused the fury of the great prophets  in     b c the assyrian armies of sennacherib destroyed  israel and moved southward to besiege jerusalem thanks to king  hezekiah’s hidden water tunnel the city narrowly escaped destruction  the end of david’s dynasty came in     b c when nebuchadnezzar king  of babylon invaded judah to lay siege to jerusalem when it fell the  temple and all the buildings were burned the people of the  once glorious city were forced into an exile known as “the babylonian  captivity ”  in time the kingdom of babylon was overthrown and the  israelites were permitted to return to jerusalem in     b c the city  was now under the more tolerant rule of the persians but rebuilding  was slow work the second temple was finished in     b c but much of  the city still lay in ruins  jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the greeks in      b c under alexander the great and subsequently to his  hellenistic successors as well as the egyptian ptolomeys and the syrian  seleucids when seleucid rulers outlawed judaism jews led by judah  maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in     b c and against  all odds restored the primacy of jewish religious life in jerusalem  the macabbees cleansed the temple of hellenistic idols and the blood of  pagan sacrifices the eight day celebration of hanukkah feast of  dedication commemorates their victory the hasmonean dynasty  descendants of the maccabee family ruled an independent jewish  commonwealth that stretched from the negev to the galilee jerusalem  grew surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside  the jaffa gate the hasmoneans ruled until pompey’s roman legions  arrived in    b c  roman jerusalem  after the initial years of roman administration and  political infighting rome installed herod scion of a family from  idumea a jewish kingdom in the desert as king of judea he reigned  from    to   b c during which time he fortified the hasmonean wall  and rebuilt the defense towers beside jaffa gate the foundation of  which still stand several palaces were built and a water system  installed herod also completely rebuilt the temple making it one of  the most important religious centers in the roman empire the courtyard  around the temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of  pilgrims and the temple mount was shored up by retaining walls made  with great stone blocks one of these walls the western wall is today  a major reminder of jerusalem’s greatness under herod a massive  fortress was built overlooking the temple mount which herod named  “antonia” in honor of his roman friend and benefactor mark antony  for all his accomplishments herod was nevertheless hated  by his subjects he taxed he tortured and he ordered the massacre of  male jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded messiah  when jesus was born in about   b c joseph and mary escaped herod’s  paranoia by fleeing into egypt with the new born infant they returned  to live in the galilee village of nazareth making pilgrimages to  jerusalem  according to biblical accounts jesus spent his life  ministering in the galilee valley in about a d    he and his  followers went for passover to jerusalem which was in unrest at this  time dissatisfied with roman domination jesus’s entry into the temple  caused a commotion after the passover dinner he was arrested by the  temple priests who were under direct roman rule jesus was put on  trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion a roman form of execution  for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals  in a province rife with rebellion and retaliation the execution in  jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the galilee did not by  itself have an immediate effect on history  after jesus’s crucifixion harsh roman rule continued until  a d    when the jews rebelled for four years jewish zealots fought  against the might of rome at the end the roman general titus laid  siege to jerusalem in a d    finally attacking its starved and  weakened defenders those who didn’t escape were executed or sold into  slavery the holy city and the temple were destroyed the last of the  zealots held out for another three years at masada see page    half  a million civilians died in the galilee and judea as a result of this  first revolt against rome a number unequaled in ancient warfare  christian and islamic jerusalem  for    years jerusalem lay in ruins until the roman  emperor hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a roman town dedicated to  jupiter in outrage the jews began a second revolt against rome led  by simon bar kochba the ruins of jerusalem were briefly liberated  but in the end jewish resistance to rome was defeated with great loss  of life the planned new roman city aelia capitolina was built over  the ruins of herodian jerusalem and jews were barred from residing  there for all time jerusalem’s physical existence as a spiritual city  seemed finished but its spiritual power for jews and for the  struggling new christian religion remained for the next two centuries  aelia capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history  but the roman empire became christian in the fourth  century and jerusalem became a center of religion once again queen  helena a devout christian and the mother of emperor constantine the  great made a pilgrimage to the holy land in     to identify the sites  associated with jesus’s life she found that the city’s most beautiful  roman temple dedicated to the goddess aphrodite stood on the site of  the crucifixion the temple was demolished and a vast classical style  church was built around golgotha the hill where jesus’s crucifixion  was believed to have taken place throughout jerusalem other spots  important to jesus’s life were commemorated with religious structures  pilgrims came from all over the roman and later byzantine empire  during the following centuries but the prosperity they brought lasted  only until     when persian armies overtook judea and reduced  jerusalem to rubble again in     jerusalem was recaptured by the  byzantines  still reeling from the effects of the persian devastation  jerusalem was conquered in     by the forces of islam the temple mount  was identified in islamic tradition as “the farthest spot” in arabic  el aksa the site to which the prophet muhammad was transported in one  night from mecca on a winged horse as described in the   th chapter of  the koran from here the prophet ascended to the heavens and was  permitted to glimpse paradise the rock on the temple mount from which  he ascended at or close to the site of the ruined temple was  commemorated by the construction of the dome of the rock in     the  dome of the rock remains jerusalem’s most striking monument it is  counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created by about  the el aksa mosque third holiest place of prayer in islam after mecca  and medina had been built on the southern side of the temple mount  jerusalem continued under islamic rule for the next four and a half  centuries in      under their leaders godfrey de bouillon and  tancred the crusaders captured the holy city for christendom by  slaughtering both muslims and jews  crusaders mamelukes and turks  the crusaders established a feudal christian state with  godfrey at its head they built many impressive churches during the  term of the first latin kingdom of jerusalem but in      they were  driven out by muslim forces under the great warrior saladin during the  sixth crusade     –      the holy roman emperor frederick ii managed  to secure jerusalem for the christians by negotiation  the christians however could not hold the city after  they lost jerusalem a mongol invasion swept through and in      the  mameluke dynasty of egypt took control ruling jerusalem for the next      years the city struggled to rebuild from crusader wars and  invasions much of the best islamic architecture in the city was  constructed in the mameluke era but the past thousand years had taken  their toll jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had  enjoyed in earlier times  in the early   th century the ottoman turkish empire was  advancing through the middle east jerusalem fell to the ottomans in       remaining under their control for     years suleiman the  magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this  day fountains inns religious schools and barracks were constructed  but when suleiman died his empire including jerusalem began a long  period of decline the holy city remained a backwater until the   th  century when renewed interest among christian pilgrims made it the  destination of thousands of travelers each year    th century aspirations  at the same time many jews sought religious freedom and  fulfillment by moving to palestine as the holy land was traditionally  called and especially to jerusalem in the     s theodor herzl      –     worked to organize a movement zionism to create a jewish  state chaim weizmann     –     a scientist born in russia but later  a british subject did much to put herzl’s hopes into practice  weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the british  government that led to the balfour declaration of      supporting the  idea of a jewish “national home” in palestine that also respected the  rights of existing non jewish people already living there the problem  was that british strategists who were fighting the ottoman turks in       had secretly promised the lands to their world war i arab  allies  in      the league of nations granted the british a mandate  to administer palestine jerusalem flourished during the early years of  the mandate modern neighborhoods hospitals schools and the hebrew  university were built in west jerusalem the new jewish enclave but  arab opposition to new jewish immigration and construction in palestine  led to increasing strife by      jerusalem was an armed camp in  the united nations voted for the partition of palestine into two  states one jewish and one arab with jerusalem as an international  city that belonged to neither but lacking the means to enforce its  decision the united nations was powerless to halt the fighting that  erupted as the british withdrew their troops in  modern israel  the state of israel was declared during this difficult  time in response member states of the arab league sent troops to help  the palestinian arabs west jerusalem separated from the rest of the  new jewish nation held out under siege for several months until  israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the  coastal areas jews were evacuated from the old city’s jewish quarter  and thousands of arab families fled their homes in west jerusalem as a  result of armistice agreements in      jerusalem was divided west  jerusalem was to be under israeli control and east jerusalem  including the old city with its jewish muslim christian and  armenian quarters came under jordanian authority free access to holy  sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice  agreements however with the city partitioned by fortifications and  barbed wire no israeli or jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the  western wall or other jewish sites in east jerusalem  for the next    years jerusalem was two cities political  and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of  terrorism or sniping until the six day war in june      within three  days the city was completely in israeli hands and in two weeks it was  physically and administratively reunited jerusalem’s mayor teddy  kollek spent the next    years orchestrating a vast program of  development adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting  neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the  concerns of jerusalem’s many communities  today as always jerusalem is a city of controversies  religious jews in conflict with secular jews palestinians calling for  independence many residents protesting a wave of high rise development  that many claim will turn the holy city into a holy megalopolis but  the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily  special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present day  jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world’s attention into the new  millennium 
  a brief history  early habitation  the inhabited history of the las vegas valley stretches to         b c when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake  during this period the indigenous people lived in caves hunting the  mammals that gathered at the shoreline the landscape of the valley  changed dramatically over the next     centuries the glaciers feeding  the lake melted away and the lake evaporated fossils tell an obscure  story of man’s slow and sporadic development  around      b c native archaic indians began to develop a  lasting hunting and gathering culture by this time the valley was in  much the same geographic state as it exists in today with one  exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the  surface in several areas these springs fed a network of streams  draining through the las vegas wash to the colorado river the areas  surrounding the springs were desert oases sprawling collections of  grasses trees and wildlife many springs lay in areas that would  eventually become the center of the modern las vegas metropolis  for about      years the archaics thrived in a culture that  included many signs of early civilization signs of even more  advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a d when  the anasazi indians inhabited the valley far more progressive than the  archaics the anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as  irrigation to assist their harvest this permitted the anasazi to  achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in  permanent shelters year round without need to follow wildlife  mysteriously the anasazi vanished from the valley around a d  leaving it to be repopulated by the southern paiutes another  hunter gatherer tribe  unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the  anasazi the paiutes were destined to a semi nomadic lifestyle until  european settlers arrived changing the nature of existence in the  valley forever  from mailmen to mormons  in the early nineteenth century america’s western  territories were still largely unexplored it was not until      that  rafael rivera a mexican scout found a spring fed valley and dubbed it  las vegas — a spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering  exactly where “the meadows” really lay  for fifteen years las vegas was used as a spanish trail  way station in      american explorer john c fremont parked his  horses at big springs and his report to the government resulted in a  mail route leading past the spot on its way to california this put las  vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its  history  in      mormon leader brigham young responded to promising  reports of las vegas by sending    missionary settlers to the valley  they eventually built a fort not far from today’s downtown surrounded  by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert the adobe fort became a  focal point for the development of las vegas for the next fifty years  the missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the  desert trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their  circumstances and spread the mormon faith additional pressures from  arriving miners pushed the missionaries’ plight beyond recovery their  supplies scarce their harvest meager and their spirit broken they  abandoned the fort in  despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver by       most of the mining traffic through las vegas was of prospectors  headed to california or northern nevada in search of gold one  opportunist who stayed was octavius decatur gass bestowed with plenty  of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes las vegas to this  day gass redirected his life by picking up where the mormons left  off — at least when it came to ranching and farming gass took over the  abandoned mormon fort and     acres     hectares surrounding it  dubbing it the las vegas ranch he expanded the ranch and irrigated the  land so that it would support crops and cattle his determination had  other results as well gass was named a justice of the peace and a  territorial legislator  despite his ambition gass’ success was short lived in the  late     s he defaulted on a loan from rancher archibald stewart so  stewart took the las vegas ranch for his own true to wild west  stereotypes stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer leaving his  strong willed wife helen to assume the duties of the ranch through       helen stewart expanded the ranch to      acres     hectares  making quite a bit of money in the process  what happened next would mark the end of the successful las  vegas ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across  almost all of western america to this day the railroad was coming and  when it arrived las vegas would never be the same again  of tracks and tracts  at the turn of the   th century los angeles and salt lake  city were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new american west  though the two cities remained unlinked by rail this was about to  change quickly when it did the las vegas valley which at the time  had a non native population of less than    would change as well  in      officials of the san pedro los angeles and salt  lake railroad arrived in las vegas eager to secure a right of way for  their los angeles–salt lake connection las vegas would serve as a  major stopover for crew rest and train repair for all this the  railroad needed land as mapped the track traveled directly through  helen stewart’s las vegas ranch stewart sold      percent of her ranch  to the railroad the remainder she returned to the native paiutes  in early      the route between los angeles and salt lake  city was completed and train tracks bore right down the center of the  las vegas valley on    may      the railroad held a land sale — a  momentous step in las vegas history standing at the depot at main and  fremont streets railroad officials auctioned      lots they had  subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub land speculators  and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad  boomtown and within an afternoon more than    percent of the lots  were sold  las vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement with  rail service in place and forty blocks of private property it was  ready to become a real town businesses sprang up overnight and wooden  houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early  settlers had lived one year after the auction the population of las  vegas had ballooned to      residents a portent of things to come for  the next ninety years  dam good luck  from the beginning las vegas was built to serve travelers  the railroad needed a way station and las vegas was the place growth  continued for ten years and by      the town had telephones  round the clock electricity and a growing population — many of whom  worked in the railroad repair shop but such heady progress would soon  come to a halt  the growing competition in rail transport resulted in union  pacific buying the los angeles–salt lake line union pacific then  consolidated its operations eliminating the las vegas repair facility  additionally las vegas had been made a part of nevada’s new clark  county in      a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling  these unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate las vegas to the  status of a small desert community that could no longer support its       residents but the southwest’s growing need for water combined  with las vegas’s fortuitous proximity to the colorado river would give  las vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity  construction on hoover dam originally boulder dam  subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project  began in      in a canyon    miles    km southeast of las vegas  providing an influx of     million to the southwestern economy hoover  dam played a major role in preventing las vegas from drying up both  financially and literally not only did it create jobs but it also  created lake mead the massive reservoir that today provides water to  all of southern nevada  more government help  the construction of hoover dam did not single handedly save  las vegas however the state legislature helped as well by legalizing  gambling in      and thus solidifying the future of the town though  legislators and residents could never have known this at the time  the hordes of people who attended hoover dam’s  dedication set the city’s now formidable public relations machine into  action they went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest  citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted it didn’t take long for the  city to establish itself as a wild west town with an “anything goes”  attitude vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal  here available any hour of any day or night thus originated las  vegas’s reputation as an adult theme park  additional catalysts for the valley’s growth came from  world war ii both the las vegas aerial gunnery school which became  nellis air force base and the nevada test site in the north and basic  magnesium in the nearby town of henderson arrived in the early     s  as a result of america’s war effort by      the population had grown  to almost        with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace  but this was not yet the las vegas of folklore  mobsters and rat packers  while many gambling halls opened downtown in the     s and  early     s only two were built on the stretch of old los angeles  highway that ultimately became the strip the el rancho vegas  was the first followed by the last frontier      during this  period east coast syndicate member benjamin “bugsy” siegel earned a  foothold as a local casino operator  by      siegel had become one of las vegas’s original  visionaries planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the la  highway when the flamingo opened in december      it did so with  hollywood flair and the new vegas flash but the mafia bosses who  financed the operation were displeased with its performance siegel was  murdered in the summer of  despite its initial failings siegel’s flamingo survived  him as did mob infiltration of casinos in fact the flamingo would  launch over two decades of strong mob presence in las vegas freely  flowing “comps” complimentary food drink and entertainment were the  order of the day with mob bosses content to provide an environment of  pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in  while the mob was running the casinos promoters were  busily selling las vegas as a glamorous hollywood in the desert from  the mid     s to the mid     s las vegas nurtured a growing sense that  it was the “entertainment capital of the world ” emerging stars no  longer content with playing small nightclubs came to las vegas with  dreams of making it big many of them did frank sinatra wayne newton  and louis prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found  themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were  written the rat pack — originally frank sinatra dean martin sammy  davis jr peter lawford and joey bishop all in town to film ocean’s     — landed at the sands in january      for a legendary stay other  hollywood stars came as well simply because las vegas was the place to  be  as a result more casinos emerged along the strip the  thunderbird desert inn sahara sands and riviera hotels were erected  during this period luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of  all night partying exclusive entertainment and cheap accommodations  there was no longer any question when you wanted some unbridled adult  fun las vegas was the place to be  new legitimacy  organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in  its bid to control las vegas — corporate cash though las vegas had  developed a powerful local economy few major outside investments were  made in the city due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent  ties to illegal activities  that would change dramatically with the      arrival of  billionaire howard hughes a legitimate businessman hughes was  nonetheless eccentric and dramatic a style suited to the las vegas  ethos true to the myth the reclusive hughes immediately cloistered  himself in the desert inn’s penthouse several weeks later he was  asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high  rollers whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the  management thus began hughes’ legendary three year     million las  vegas buying spree when it was over hughes owned six casinos an  airport and an airline along with numerous plots of land stretching  from the strip to the mountains  hughes’ actions would have beneficial repercussions both  immediate and lasting because of the new legitimacy las vegas acquired  from hughes’ investments established companies such as hilton hotels  bought into the gaming business and their influence helped draw a line  in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos where  illegal skimming of profits was rampant that combined with the  formation of the nevada gaming control board would signal the  beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city  las vegas with a vision  as corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out  a new las vegas emerged the legitimization of gambling led to its  increased legalization across the us what was once a sure thing became  much more competitive casino operators had to reassess the nature of  their business  the first to really do so was steve wynn a las vegas  resident and owner of the golden nugget in the mid     s wynn began  plans to reinvigorate las vegas with a new resort he bought several  strip properties — the silver slipper and castaways among them — and  demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — mirage —  which  became an instant success  wynn’s demolition of the existing properties started a  trend that more than any other describes las vegas at the end of the    th century removal of old properties in exchange for the potential  of new ones this trend has led to many more demolitions including the  dunes replaced by bellagio aladdin the new aladdin and sands  venetian hotels  wynn’s casinos have also set new standards they can no  longer be just a box filled with gaming tables restaurants and a  showroom excalibur the mgm grand the luxor and new york new york  all followed mirage’s lead during the     s offering themed  environments and attractions for families  as evidence of the “ever faster” nature of the city by the  middle of the     s the new approach showed signs of backlash with  many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the las vegas experience  the latest approach is perhaps the best of the post mob era the  comprehensive resort new resorts offer attractions and amenities  modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide including  luxurious spas signature restaurants and exclusive boutiques  additionally a handful of resorts — such as the south seas  themed mandalay bay the mirage and the new four seasons — are now  catering exclusively to the luxury travel market the crème de la crème  of las vegas deluxe is steve wynn’s bellagio the world’s most  expensive resort at     billion the bellagio’s amenities include    star dining chanel caliber boutiques and a world class collection  of artistic masterworks perhaps more important such high end  accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the  mythology of the rat pack era  as it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming  venue the population of las vegas skyrocketed over        additional  hotel rooms have been added in a few short years including resorts in  summerlin and lake las vegas recent business projections for las vegas  predict challenges tourism revenues must increase substantially to  sustain what is already built while actual figures show visitation as  steady or declining the growth that has characterized las vegas for  nearly a century may be facing a roadblock  still the future of las vegas is sure to be determined as  much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else  with its new look and new aim the prospects are good despite the  warnings inevitably some people will get burned in the process but  others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes  and that more than anything is the one constant that characterizes  the past present and future of las vegas 
  dublin and the dubliners  as capital of europe’s most explosive economy dublin seems  to be changing before your very eyes new construction is everywhere  the streets buzz traffic is increasingly congested and in the  frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in dublin seems intent on changing  places with everyone else at night the streets are crowded with people  bent on having a good time prosperity is in the air the roar of the  “celtic tiger” can clearly be heard  but this is not the whole picture the proverbial  hospitality and warm welcome are still here this busy modern european  city sits on a thousand years of history — history is present  everywhere from elegant merrion square to the bullet holes on the  general post office it’s also a city of the imagination reinvented  and reappraised in the literature of its exiles and the old dublin is  with us too — the irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar  magic possessed by ireland and the irish  prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis on historic  preservation dublin excels in packaging its past for the visitor you  can view artifacts from the bronze age trace the history of the easter  rising or revisit leopold bloom’s odyssey in ulysses old buildings  are being recycled for example the   th century royal hospital now  holds the museum of modern art and dublin a city large in  expectations is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its  sights on foot  city on the liffey  the river liffey flows from west to east through the center  of the city to dublin bay the river forms a natural line between the  north and south sections of the city this geography is important in  understanding dublin historically and culturally this north south  distinction has always been significant and it still is today with a  dose of good humored rivalry between the two areas “ i never go north  of the liffey ” one man remarked  farther out both north and south are the sweeping curves  of the royal and grand canals the occasional cry of gulls and  unexpected distant vistas will remind you that dublin is by the sea  and the wicklow mountains which hold dublin closely to the coast are  visible from everywhere  dublin is an intimate city physically small but tightly  packed a perfect place for walking college green the home of trinity  college provides a natural focus just south of the o’connell street  bridge o’connell street the city’s grand boulevard leads north to  parnell square to the south and east is st stephen’s green and  georgian dublin where the national museums are located along the  liffey to the west is temple bar center of nightlife and home to many  of dublin’s cutting edge artists and artistic endeavors up the hill  from temple bar are dublin castle and christ church cathedral  it won’t rain on you in dublin all the time the climate  here can best be described as “changeable” and yet the sudden shifts  from light to dark sunshine to shower are part of the city’s magic  buildings seem to transform themselves depending on the light dublin  under a lowering sky is a different place from dublin in sunshine  enjoying dublin  literature has always flourished in dublin the only city  to have produced three nobel prize winners for literature — yeats  shaw and beckett joyce the high priest of literary modernism  imagined and interpreted dublin for the world in ulysses you’ll see  references to it all over however sometimes it seems that the city  produced artists of this stature by accident even against its will  beckett and joyce among others had to leave their homeland to  understand it —  and to be understood  dublin theater is legendary and no visitor should miss  seeing a performance at the abbey theatre or gate theatre the city’s  impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of u  and bob  geldof is well known — there’s even a self guided tour of their haunts  traditional irish music is also alive and well especially in the pubs  and there has been a revival of storytelling poetry reading and  traditional dancing and in this city where literature and theater  have historically dominated the scene visual arts are finally coming  into their own with the new museum of modern art and the many galleries  that display the work of modern irish artists  the constantly crowded and busy grafton street is the most  visible center for shopping but there are shops all over that carry an  international array of goods as well as the irish crafts and souvenirs  you expect and while multinational chains have made inroads they seem  less blatant here than elsewhere many shops and also hotels and guest  houses have been owned and managed by the same families for years and  theirs is the welcome of traditional dublin hospitality  dublin’s food has undergone a metamorphosis there was a  time when you might have apologized for it but no longer dublin has  international restaurants galore and the new irish cuisine is built  upon fresh products of ireland’s seas rivers and farms coffee has  replaced the ubiquitous tea — dublin is now almost as much a coffee  city as vienna or seattle  city and countryside  in a city of such human proportions it is not surprising  that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation phoenix  park in the northwest is the largest open space but squares like st  stephen’s green are the garden oases of the city  on the coast sandymount dollymount and killiney strands  are the places to go the beautiful wicklow mountains and the wicklow  mountains national park provide a more rugged countryside and the area  has breathtaking houses and gardens such as castletown mount usher  and powerscourt to the north and west are the ancient sites of  ireland malahide castle the evocative hill of tara and the long  barrows of knowth and newgrange  the dart dublin area rapid transit runs north and south  along the coast it’s an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying  sights and villages there are many guided bus tours to sights outside  the city and some are accessible by city bus  young at heart  dublin is a young city almost half of ireland’s population  is under twenty five and with its universities and professional  schools dublin also has a large student population the universities  attract students from all over the world and this influx helps to make  dublin a busy buzzing international city however young and old  stranger and dubliner rub shoulders quite happily religion and respect  for parents has not yet gone out of fashion and young graduates are  not leaving now — multinational corporations and european union  investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home  unemployment is at an all time low the irish are actually beginning to  come home
