Abstract--Cellular proliferation was obtained from 30 out of 58 labial tumours
examined. None of the cellular cultures obtained presented Herpes Simplex Virus type 1
(HSV-1) specific antigens. Tumour cell cultures demonstrated the same susceptibility to
HSV-1 as cells from normal lip tissue, HEp-2 and BHK cells. The presence of HSV-
1 DNA was investigated in 12 labial tumours by the blotting technique. The sensitivity
of the technique made it possible to reveal 0.5 viral genome equivalent per cell. Viral
DNA was not detected in any of the tumours tested.
INTRODUCTION
HERPEsSimplex Viruses (HSV) have been
divided into two types: type 1 (HSV-1) which
is normally responsible for oral lesions and
type 2 (HSV-2) which causes genital lesions.
HSV-1 infections are usually acquired during
early childhood by the oral-respiratory route
[1] and more than 90% of adults have evidence
of past HSV-1 infections [2]. On the
other hand, HS.V-2 infections are generally
acquired venereally [3]. HSV infections are
not necessarily lyric, culminating in the destruction
of the cell and in elimination of
virus. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can persist in
a non-lyric form in some tissues such as the
sensory ganglia [4]. Moreover, there are several
data supporting a relationship between
HSV and human tumours. The association
between HSV-2 and cervical cancer is suggested
by a number of studies. The first evidence
comes from reports that the incidence of
neutralizing antibodies to HSV-2 is higher in
patients with cervical carcinoma than in mat-

ched controls [54]. Secondly, human cervical
tumour cells contain HSV-2 RNA [9], HSV-2
DNA and RNA [10]. Thirdly, HSV-2 specific
antigens are present in cervical carcinoma
extracts [11-16]. The possible correlation between
cervical carcinoma and HSV-2 stimulated
us to search for a similar correlation
between HSV-1 and lip tumours. With regard
to this subject it has to be noted that the
scientific literature is very scarce and only a
few studies have been undertaken, especially
concerning the epidemiologic and clinical aspects.
It has been reported that often a tumour
arises in the same location of herpetic
recurrences [17]. It seems also that the immune
response to HSV-1 is higher in preneoplastic
stages, is reduced during oncogenesis
and is restimulated after tumour excision
[18]. Also the short time lag between
the herpetic lesion and some tumour growth
supports the hypothesis of a HSV-1 oncogenic
role [19].
This paper reports data concerning (i) the
search of specific antigens in cells derived
from different labial tumours and cultivated in
vitro, (ii) the susceptibility of these cells to
HSV-1 infections and (iii) the search for the
presence of viral DNA in tumour cells employing
the blotting technique originally described
by Southern [20].
